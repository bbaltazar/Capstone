      "I did really like this product. I used it in replace of my normal 200mg caffeine 2x a day. It did give me a good pick-me-up without all the jitters. It is always hard to judge effectiveness of a fat burner. I did take 2 full bottles at the recommended 2 pills 2x a day. 2 upon waking and then 2 more little before lunch, I lost about 5% body fat during that time. (we have electronic bf calculators at my gym for competition guys, so that is not just a blind guess). I also was on about a 600 calorie deficit. This cut included only about 30min cardio 1 or 2x a week. Mostly just maintaining strength while dropping body fat. The pills did help control hunger, keep me active, had a little to no jitters. Overall if you are looking for something to give you more pep and help burn a little extra this is for you. Overall good product.\n",
      "Didn't get a lot of energy like other supplements did but for sure controlled my appetite. But, with my daily 45 minutes cardio session, I can see myself shredding :) \n",
      "My 1st review on a product. I did 20 capsules for a test run. It didn't work as people claim but I didn't follow the directions correctly. I order the 90 capsules & follow the direction. Yes take 2 capsules on an EMPTY stomach 30 minutes before a meal also I took 2 capsules on an EMPTY stomach with plenty of pre-work out drink 30 minutes before evening working out. I feel & visually seeing my tummy tightening. For the men... It does help down below. That's a bonus due to Yohimbine. Price is not bad. 120 capsule choose would be nice. This product I will continue using until I find something better. Two Thumbs Up.\n",
      "I've never really been a fan of thermogenics since I don't really think they work, but I was surprised by this product. I wake up around 5am and I'm normally half sleep during cardio but not today. Man I was focused and my energy seemed to be very high. It wasn't a jittery high either. I felt so good that after I was done with my normal workout I trained with my girlfriend. I'd like to also mention that I train fasted. I was checking out the ingredients and I noticed not only do they have yohimbine in the product but they also have 7-oxo-dehydrpia(keto-7 in it.  I'd love for 360 to make that Keto-7 in a stand alone product. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been taking this product for a couple of months and its been a great addition to my supplement regimen. Right\n",
      "away I noticed soo much more energy without getting jittery or nauseous. I have tons more energy in the afternoon, being able to get a great workout in even after 12hrs at work. I highly recommend this if you are looking for that extra push throughout the day. \n",
      "This product really worked for me gets me up and going and also suppresses my hunger. Within the months I was taking this I lost a couple pounds. Will definitely be purchasing this again. \n",
      "I have tried many fat burners before, but have never saw better results than with 360 cut lean thermogenic formula. I take them exactly as directed and have feel leaner then ever! Gives me amazing energy and focus especially when working out. I've ordered this multiple times and will continue to order them as well as other 360 cut products!\n",
      "i have tried four other companies and this is by far my favorite.  it does what it says without making me feel jittery. i will buy this product again\n",
      "Hands down one of the best thermos I've used. I take a few of these throughout the day and mixed with a good diet and workout routine the results show. Definitely recommend to others \n",
      "This product is awesome.  I was wanting a product that revved up my metabolism that would assist in leaning down but would still allow me to maintain or increase muscle mass.  In 6 months I became stronger, increased muscle mass and cut my body fat from 22 percent to 11 percent.  This product helped me achieve the goals I wanted!\n",
      "My boyfriend and I love this thermogenic, he does not work out much, but uses it as energy pill for long hours at work.  It gives me energy & helps me stay lean.\n",
      "Great products 360cut .... Follow on Instagram ! \n",
      "\n",
      "Love this product and happy to see it on BB.com at a great price!!  I work out early morning, 360 Lean provides me the wake up, focus and strength I want for a great work out.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Tried thIs product after following the Dean Michael  on instagram.  Figured I'd try it and I liked it. Gave me energy Not to much where you get that jittery feeling. When I took it before if hit the gym it gave me that extra energy. I lost a couple pounds on this could have been more if I was more consistent with my diet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Will definitely have you feeling \"heated\". Great mental booster.\n",
      "great mood stabilizer, and great evergy without the over kill or jitters \n",
      "\n",
      "I just received this pre-workout this week and thank god on leg day because i was all out.  I just took a recommended scoop in 8oz-10oz of water.  it tasted amazing and i KILLED my leg workout . I am in a contest prep right now so this preworkout helps with my sweet tooth AND gets me through my workouts!!!! i spent 2 hours in the gym with leg day and cardio and with minimum amount of sleep and pushed through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried multiple types of preworkout and have found that this is one of my favorites. I've only tried the pineapple passion, but the cotton candy is in my list to try next. I really enjoy the pineapple flavor as it is light and mixes well with my amino acids. I have a bad habit of getting tired of a flavor and not being able to finish it, but this preworkout is different and I'm now on my second one. I also avoid any preworkout that gives me a \"tingling\" feeling. I never have that problem with this product \n",
      "I love the cotton candy flavor of this product. The pineapple passion on the other hand I will not re-reorder. Its taste is not pleasant, I only use this on emergency if I dont have a travel portion of my CC with me. \n",
      "Mixes easily, gets me energized and helps me max my gym time without any side effects, really love this product.  I have used 360cut products for over a year now and I believe they are superior to other products \n",
      "Great pre workout! No jitters, headaches, nausea, or crash! Just clean powerful energy that LASTS throughout my workout. Flavor was perfect, no nasty aftertaste. Product never clumped and mixed well! Definitely recommend this product to everyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward to trying their new 360Rage asap!\n",
      "This is one of the best preworkouts I have ever tasted. Way better than C-4 doesn't give u the jitters. Plus OMG !!! The best freaking tasting every taste like watermelon jolly rancher :) I always buy this product. I have already bout like 3 on here and 2 on amazon. Plus their 360 fat burner pills are awesome. \n",
      "I have been using 360cut products for over a year now and i am 100% satisfied with this brand. Ive tried other products in the past but nothing else compares to the quality of 360cut products. In 2014 i made the switch! The results speak for themselves  \n",
      "Tried it for the first time a few weeks ago and now I use this every morning before I train at the gym.  There isn't an uncomfortable tingle that comes out of nowhere and the flavor is great.  Even without the tingle I knew the product was working b/c of the energy I had to complete my workouts.  \n",
      "This is one of the best pre workout supplements I have taken. It gives me energy for my workout and I don't \"crash\" afterwards. I would definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "I kept hearing about 360 products on social media and decided to try the pre workout. I love that it doesn't give me any side effect or make my face feel weird like any other pre workout. I will continue buying it and definitely recomend this product. The pump that I get is very intense and I love it because I can finish my work out without losing my energy. Excellent product\n",
      "This Pre-workout is great! The flavors taste amazing and they mix very will with little no no clumps. It not as stimulant heavy as I am used to although the pump and focus are spot on. I always leave the gym satisfied with my workout. Great product and I can't wait to see what else this company has in store!\n",
      "Hands down one of the best pre workouts I have used. Gets the job done and the taste is great. Just ordered pineapple flavored can't wait to try it. Definitely staying loyal to this brand. \n",
      "Great preworkout powder & it tastes great ! The entire line of cut360 is good , try the thermogenic pills & the intra-workout ,  follow on Instagram for motivation & product s****estions!! \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste was horrible. Did not have any kind of boost from this product.\n",
      "This has to be one of if not the best pre-workout i have ever taken.   The taste is spot on.  It mixes well.  I take it about 20 minutes before its time to workout. I jog a mile to warm up and then hammer my lift out.  I notice no drop in energy or Focus. I am putting up at least 10 or more lbs during my work outs.  I usually lift for more than an hr and still have enough energy to jog 3 to 4 miles after my workouts.  I have taken other products that give a better pump but then crash.  i am totally satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "Doest the job great. It is good that you can mix it with your own pre-workout and it does not give any side effects. I mix it with Defcon and it went amazing, focus, insanity, wanted to chew weights :) if you have descent pre-workout that you use, 360PUMP will be great addition. \n",
      "I recommend this product to anyone looking for good pumps w/o all the other stimulants. It wasn't the best product I've tried for pumps but for the price you can't beat it!\n",
      "I really love this product. I wasn't seeing the scale move at all in 4 months of consistent excercise and diet and I was feeling really frustrated. I added this to my routine and this gave my metabolism the boost it needed. Within 2 weeks of taking this daily with excercise and clean diet, I've dropped 7 pounds and have sustainable energy through the day without jitters or a crash. It definitely helps suppress hunger through the day. If you're just starting I'd recommend taking just 1 pill before breakfast and one before dinner. I started with two in the morning and two in the evening but it surprised my appetite a little TOO well and found myself having to force myself to eat and it was difficult with the small portions I already eat. So be careful with the dose but definitely worth trying if you need an extra boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began taking 360 slim around the end of May so I am in the middle of my second month! I love the results I have gotten with the help of 360 slim! I workout 6 days a week and count my calorie intake and in 8 weeks I have lost a total of 12 pounds. It doesn't sound like a lot but I've replaced fat with muscle and have toned my body down four belt sizes. I love the energy and the results I have gained from 360 cut/360 slim and would recommend it for anyone trying to slim down their figure! \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you 360 cut!!!!! :) \n",
      "I purchased this product awhile back and loved the results it helped me obtain! I was at 25.3% body fat, and over the course of using it I knocked it down to 23.8%! Obviously just taking this will not get results; it also takes the exercise and proper nutrition. With other products I've had trouble with nausea and jitters, but with this one there was none. Yall are great!\n",
      "I really like this product. I take it twice a day. I have energy to get through my day and workout. I get no jittery feelings Which is great.\n",
      "Just started taking this product and i feel it working!! Super excited to what the outcome of this product!!\n",
      "Love the taste of the Passion Fruit.  Great product. \n",
      "Great amino acids, pure and clear with no added ****.\n",
      "Great on the stomach too.\n",
      "This is a decent BCAA supplement that offers a fair amount of aminos per serving. The only downside of this product is the fact that it contains Acesulfame Potassium, Sucralose (artificial flavors) AND artificial colors. The taste is just okay and you can definitely taste the artificial flavorings. It gets the job done, but I wish it contained Stevia instead of Sucralose. I will not be buying this again.\n",
      "Tastes great. Gets rid of my muscle soreness during workouts. I would recommend.\n",
      "Fantastic product. Great results. \n",
      "Amazing amino supplement! Taste awesome and encourages you to drink more fluids. I'm on my third container. I have tried various BCAA/amino products, but this one wins hands down\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the taste! Keeps me going. Feel super strong and energetic in the gym!  Helps with my endurance and quick recovery, Highly recommend this product. \n",
      "Nice protein, good dissolution however the taste could have been better (not good at all with water) but in overall it is a good protein: No sugar, no fat, low sodium ! Perfect !!!\n",
      "Taste is pretty good for Casein.  Macro's are awesome!\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I don't give this casein a 10 is because it's ultra messy (super fine powder comes statically charged and likes to stick to the scooper and get everywhere no matter how careful I am).  It also doesn't mix as nicely as ON brand's casein's do.  This one tends to clump up a little, bit and gets REALLY frothy.  These are just minor anoyances though.  Overall great casein!\n",
      "Seems to work alright,just the taste could use some help.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first Casein protein i've bought, however i am so satisfied with the product that i not try another until i am bored. I mix the chocolate flavor with 8-10 ounces of no sugar added almond milk (30 cal per 8 oz.) before bed and i am completely satisfied. I did notice if you use a blinder ball it doesn't come out as thick as it would if you use the Bodybuilding.com shaker bottle. 10/10 will continue to purchase. \n",
      "\n",
      "not grainy, mixes well with fruit & taste is delish! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Has a much smoother texture then the other casein Ive tried.  Was going to order another but it's not available.  Hopefully it will be back soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste of this casein is so bad that it makes you try to forget that it is in your kitchen for you to use. I did not see crazy results while using this product and will not buy it again. As i am writing this review i am forcing myself to drink another shake until i run out. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a good product, I've tried 1 scoop in 300ml of water, almond milk or skim milk, in all of them the protein mixed well, no clumps no nothing, i noticed with water the vanilla flavor makes a little bit more foam but is not something very bad at all. I tried lots of casein's before from ON, Dymatize and other brand but this one is better, better taste better mixing. I will reorder again maybe chocolate flavor to see the taste difference.\n",
      "this product taste wise it is horrible, they said it wasnt thick but yet it was too the point i had to use a spoon if anyone could recommed a good casein plz reply. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Update- i decided to use almond milk to see if it was better, it was a little better and had a rich flavor so it somewhat great im still going to look around for something else but i might reorder again considering i feel it better and less thick with almond milk \n",
      "\n",
      "The product does not dissolve at all in skim milk.  In water in fares better, but the taste is less than desirable.  I hope my next brand is better.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff is great, with regards of taste and mixability. Also its quality protein; crossflow microfiltrated micellar casein. You want quality protein? This is it. I definitely will be purchasing this stuff again. \n",
      "\n",
      "This one had a nastiest taste I've ever tried. and yes i'm using it straight, no mixing with anything. So why am i giving rating 8?! once you'll be ok with the taste you'll get your best non cafinated, non artificially flavoured and non colored preworkout solution that is giving you push , endurance and recovery!\n",
      "Overall it blends well with your choice of beverage. Have only used it once so am unable to provide details concerning the pros and cons. However, I did drop the overall rating since there was no scoop in my jar. Luckily I was able to find another 5g scoop from a different jar before I threw it out.\n",
      "A lot of bang for your buck. One container lasts 60 days. However they melt together easily (almost room temperature) and look to be more processed than other fish oils. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I GOT THIS PRODUCT.     ITS GREAT.  AMAZING STRENGTH.  WHEN I TRIED TO RE ORDER ITS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INDIAN MARKET. THIS MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES FOR THE INDIAN AND OTHER MARKETS.\n",
      "BODYBUILDING.COM SHOULD ENSURE THAT THIS PRODUCT AND ALL THE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR INDIA. CUSTOMERS LIKE ME WHO ARE WILLING TO BUY EVEN BY PAYING HUGE SHIPPING CHARGES, BUT ARE NOT ABLE TO GET.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good product. I am only using this product for the last 3 or 4 weeks. I lost a few pounds. May be more in the next month.\n",
      "I have used this product off and on for several years and I've always got good results. I would recommend it any day. \n",
      "\n",
      "not a weight loss solution, but definitely helps i keeping the midsection quite trim. I thought that the product was at first not working, and went off it for about 2-3 weeks and switched to other brands of oils. boy did i notice the difference despite my dietary and exercise habits being constant! I figured that it was abcuts that was the contributing factor and decided to give it a go one more time, and lo and behold, my midsection really did start to trim. it's doesn't promise you washboard abs but it helps shed some of the bulk in the abdomen and handles. will definitely DEFINITELY continue using.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great product. I use all the Ab Cuts, red and green as well.\n",
      "I'm taking this with Thermo Push and OH BABY, my waist is leaning out quickly. Great product!\n",
      "Be taking this product for like a month lost 2 inch on my waist a 40 to a 38 loose . Time for more\n",
      "I Like it. I think it does what its intended to do. The one thing thou is if you stop taking it you see the weight come back in the areas it came from.\n",
      "this stuff is wicked strong... i get crazy jitters from this unless i expense all that energy with a thorough workout. the energy is excessive for a desk-bound job and completely ruins my day if i don't expend it first thing in the morning before i get to work. also get an insane amount of focus during workouts, but beware of the crash once the effect wears off, if it even wears off!.. this product worked well for my weight loss goals but i wouldn't recommend using this long-term. THIS STUFF IS POTENT!\n",
      "I am reordering this product because when I used it the first time it worked great for me. I was more energized throughout the day and definitely saw a huge change in my midsection within a week. I did not weigh myself while taking these pills because I could see they were working.  \n",
      "Tastes great. Not chalky and no aftertaste. Lots of protein low on carbs and fat just the way a protein shake should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was going to get the milk chocolate but it was on backorder so I tried the peanut butter. I say great RTD shake I use it mostly for at work as I do shift work when I can't get in a meal not bad 270 calories and 50 grams protein the taste is pretty good too. Taste like peanut butter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great to have around on those long nights at work. Highly recommend. \n",
      "This drink is super tasty and with 50 pounds of protein, it really packs a punch after a solid workout.  My only criticism is that there isn't more!  I always find myself craving more than the 14.5 oz that's in the bottle.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed with this shake!\n",
      "Oh man this is my favorite!! This flavor is insanely good. I can't get enough of these and I look forward to them during every workout. Get that refreshed ice cold vanilla bean protein after a hard lift. Take my word for it and buy these.\n",
      "Great for getting enough protein while at the office and keeping nutrient intake steady throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Works great. It gets me focused and gives me the strength I need to lift.\n",
      "This stuff is great! The flavor is awesome and it really works. Drink this before all my work outs!\n",
      "I will definitely purchase again. \n",
      "This is a great pre-workout energy drink.  I love the fact that it is pre-made and sits in my refridge waiting to be drank.  It helps me get through a workout after a long day of work.  I feel energized and focused when I'm lifting.  So far, I have tasted the Berry Bomb, which is good.  I definitely would recommend this product to others.\n",
      "Always gives me the boost I need before a workout\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the only pre work out that works for me I have tried a few but this one is by far the best \n",
      "This product taste great and really helps you get that extra edge you need when everything else wont work....   I've had Grape and Berry Bomb but hands down the Fruit Punch is my Favorite...  When this product kicks in i'm like the HULK nothing can stop me, and i sleep great too, especially knowing that i had a great work out...\n",
      "Always makes me feel positive, awake and alert before a workout\n",
      "\n",
      "LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT , I have used others BUT always come back to this product because IT WORKS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently brought this product and overall I am very happy. The chocolate flavor is really good, however, the mix ability of the product is only adequate and the 4 scoop guideline for 1 serving is well over the 100g serving nutritional information on the back of the packet.\n",
      "i got this recently as i didn't need a high protein powder more a high calorie one i can fill in the gaps when a i need the extra in the day. It suggests to mix 100g with 200ml of water i will deffinately never do that again it was the worst shake i have ever had it mixed very poorly around 20% powder left. i then tried 500ml water and was still around 10% powder left and still tasted awful. I then tried it with 400ml whole milk and a banana which was ok. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would advise to mix with at least 400ml milk and to get a better flavour throw a banana in there to adds up the calories and isn't to bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "As always a fantastic service from bodybulding.com - a slight confusion with my address ( i live in a forest so abit confusing to find ) none the less they had the matter resolved sharpish and kept me up to date.\n",
      "I have been trying many different beef proteins over the last year. This is by far my favorite....it mixes well, it tastes good, doesn't have a bunch of harsh dyes in it like Carnivor and it doesn't bother my stomach. I think it has helped me put on some good lean muscle...currently 5'10\" and 186lbs @ 9% body fat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use a scoop of 100% beef, a scoop of nutrabio casein, and a complex carb for my breakfast shake.\n",
      "Now, BB used to have an offer where you buy one and get one 50% off. A good deal for 4lbs of protein total. But that deal no longer exists and this stuff is expensive to buy a months worth (4lbs) without out that offer so I will be trying another company's beef protein next. How come the company doesn't offer a 4lb container?!\n",
      "Overall not a bad tasting product for beef. My downside was and I don't know if it was just the container I ordered or what but it DID NOT HAVE A SCOOP and chocolate has been out of stock or on back order  for months. I contacted the company about it and never received a response. (Before any one asks or wonders if the scoop was mixed in with the protein it wasn't. A hand covered in protein and a empty tub later nothing.)\n",
      "Bought this because it was rated 10/10. I am not impressed, honestly I am beginning to think that the rating system is a farce and that companies are paying for the rating they are getting. I would have asked for my money back but I already had to wait 2 weeks for this product because it was on back order. The flavor was drinkable but it was pretty gross. Not really happy with this purchase. Moral I the story is, talk to people you actually know because this rating system is ********.\n",
      "I sleep like a baby every night. Friends and co-workers want to know what I am doing. Skin glowing,toning up especially upper body..\n",
      "RUN don't walk to the checkout button and buy some of this pumpkin pie whey. 10/10 flavor, texture, macros, you HAVE TO DO IT now. Don't stop. Be basic. Cave to your inner white girl.\n",
      "This didn't make me feel anyrbing at all and I think was terrible \n",
      "I was a big fan of BSN's Nitrix and Nitrix 2.0, but it's too expensive for just pumps at the gym.  I tried this product, Agmatine by AI Sports Nutrition, and loved it.  I was skeptical at first, but after the first day I felt and noticed the difference.  I did 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules in the afternoon before going to the gym.  My muscles felt full.  I didn't realize how full and dialed it looked until I walked by a mirror at the gym and almost didn't recognize myself LOL\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways... Good price and real results.  This product elivered what it promised.  Purchasing my second order right now.\n",
      "****ght, i have tried many different NO boosters over the years dating back to college. many of them would work for a couple of weeks and then it was like my body got use to them and therefore the pumps at gym time and throughout the day seemed to diminish. maybe it was just me or my perception. who knows. I decided to give this product a try. not only to i feel great in my workouts (i also take a concentrated pre-workout product) but my pumps seem to last through the day. I get people mentioning my veins popping throughout the day, as they blow up in my forearms and calves. truly impressed with this stuff. i am sure, that in combination with my amino supplementation, it has helped combat soreness after some pretty nasty workouts.\n",
      "Wow! This product is amazing. I stacked it with NO Explode and Karbolyn along with D-Ribose. I am reminded of what happened when I started creatine: good pumps, great energy and focus, big gains in strength and endurance. This product definitely wires you and makes workouts and endurance sports a lot more effortless. Even one 250mg capsule is effective. I ride my mountain bike on a 2 hour climb from 1300 to 5000 ft elevation and after adding Agmatine I could sustain a more intense workout with less fatigue when I finally completed this nasty climb. This stuff works as advertised, most unusual.\n",
      " This is a great product for stacking with almost any preworkout supp.\n",
      "I tried a couple of other types of daa but found this to be the best bang for my buck. \n",
      "\n",

      "Haven't noticed much of a difference. Been on this, stacked with TestPro from AI as well. I've always fell asleep within 5 minutes so I didn't have any troubles there. I wake up pretty easily too... I was mainly looking for some gains but haven't noticed much.\n",
      "Great sleep \n",

All my life I have had an awful time falling asleep and staying asleep but when I take this stuff at night it relaxes me and I always fall into a very deep sleep, and wake up rested mentally and physically the following morning. My every day life is very taxing and demanding (12 hour work day, graduate school plus working out 5 days a week) so this product is a staple in what I take. I recommend it. \n",
      " Will buy again!!!\n",
      " Very pleased with this supplement!\n",
      "\n",
      "This powder is no longer \"vegan friendly\" as they changed the formula completely and now use casein in it. Just a warning to people who might be buying it for that reason or for those who have allergies.\n",
      "Th best vegan protein powder ever. I tried everything from Vega, to RawFusion, PlantFusion, and so many more but most of them have that artificial flavor taste, or tastes like powder. No Whey is a creamy chocolate formula that makes you feel like you're drinking rich chocolate milk (although I mix it with water and ice). There's 31 grams of protein in two scoops and let me say, mixed with some cashew butter, it makes a great chocolate pudding (Jell-o can't compare!). \n",
      "Seriously, one of the BEST tasting and mixable vegetarian/vegan powders I have tried. Light texture mixes well with no gritty stuff sinking to the bottom of the cup. Taste is exceptional, cant even tell that pea protein is the first ingredient and it actually tastes like chocolate! I cannot believe the quality of this powder and the price is much lower than any other veg powder I have found online or in stores. The Vitamin and mineral profile is such an added bonus. I mix one scoop (15 grams protein) instead of recommended two scoops (30 grams protein) to keep the calories lower but still get an added boost to my daily protein requirements and vitamins too. \n",
      "I highly recommend this powder. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whey isolates cause imflammation and breakouts for me, so I've tried a few pea, brown rice and hemp proteins...The best non-whey protein I've tried thus far. The flavor is really good for a vegan protein -though you still get the after taste of the pea protein, and it's pretty thick if only mixed with 8 fl oz, so I usually use 12oz or a bit more if I'm using almond milk. The profile of this protein powder is very nice and eliminates the need for me to take additional magnesium and zinc with my Opti-Womens multi...I'd highly recommend it!\n",
      "In LOVE with this protein! I recently became vegan and was looking for a new go-to protein powder since I can't have whey anymore, and I've definitely found it! The pumpkin pie flavor is amaaaaazing! It smells JUST like pumpkin pie!! Tastes fantastic too! This is the first vegan protein powder I have found that doesn't have that gritty taste! Even though I actually don't mind the gritty taste of normal vegan protein powders haha. Super thick when mixed, which is great for smoothies, and has a great profile too. The only con I would say is it could mix a little better, but really nothing too bad! I can't wait to try the chocolate flavor!\n",
      "After having terrible skin reactions to ingredients featured in Whey Protein, I decided to check out my alternative protein options. What better protein to try than \"NO-WHEY\" Ha! But really, this product is wonderful. It mixes great in a shake AND with water, the flavor is incredible, and I did not have any negative skin side effects. I would recommend this brand to anyone and everyone. THANK YOU AI SPORT NUTRITION FOR SIMPLY EXISTING : )\n",
      "Thick. Recommended amount of water per serve is 8-10oz, good luck drinking it, it's like yoghurt. Bring a spoon. Even with double water it's still really thick. Serving size is 50g for 30g protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavour is OK, quite smooth, not too sweet. Not particularly pumpkin pie, more like a sweet cinamon/nutmeg/ginger type taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I liked the thick glugginess of it I would buy it again, but I prefer to just down my protein shakes as quick as possible and forget about them.\n",
      "very thick protein. like porridge. and tasty.\n",
      "Absolutely love this protein powder!  It is the best tasting non-whey protein I've ever had, and mixes wonderfully with water!  It also seems to be more filling than whey protein.  \n",
      "I am lactose intolerant and this protein does not give me stomach issues since it's lactose free. So that's the major reason I like the protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "30g of protein in two scoops serving size is reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the labels are true it contains very low sodium which is a plus. Sugar is 5grams which is not a big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not taste that good, but not that bad that you won't be able to drink it. \n",
      "Yes, it is thick when you mix with water but It is not a big issue since I don't drink protein shakes for taste or good textures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall if you are lactose intolerant, this protein is for you.\n",
      "It's a good quality protein but its hard to get down. This is by far much thick than any protein shake I've tried even when mixed with water. The label says mix with 8-10 oz of water but I use 14-16 oz and its still extremely thick. If you use 8-10 oz when mixing you will need a spoon to eat it. I literally stand over my sink gagging every time I drink this, not because of the flavor (although its horrible) but because the thickness causes it to stick to my throat. It's a good buy if you can stomach the taste and keep it down. \n",
      "one word- AMAZING.  I have replaced my morning coffee with this.  I also drink it prior to and during a workout and it provides a great boost.  Clean, sustained energy with no crashing.  I turned other Surgeons on to this product.  They love it for the energy and mental focus it provides.  Great product & the pina colada is DELICIOUS.\n",
      "AllMax hit a home run with A-Cuts the taste is fantastic and the boost of energy I gain helps make my workday (beer man)and workouts go a lot smoother. The Pina Colada is so refreshing on a hot day. Can't wait to try more of their flavors. Great Job AllMax might have to try their other supplements now.\n",
      "This product tastes great and gives me a nice mid afternoon boost!\n",
      "Provides me with the perfect amount of energy to get through my morning cardio.  This is the best tasting amino acid/ energy supplement I've ever had after trying many.\n",
      "If you are an avid amino user, you will love this product! The taste is ON POINT!! Amazing and makes you want to drink it all day; just be careful as it does have more caffeine than other amino products (ie...amino energy). \n",
      "Love Amino Cuts as an everyday pick me up! Also use it just before a blast of cardio or added to a non stimulant Pre-workout powder.  LOVE the Pina Colada!!! Amazing flavor and No jitters!! \n",
      "I've been using aminos for a little over two years now.. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm always open to try new products because I want any extra help I can get.\n",
      "I was given a tub of the piña colada to sample and immediately was sold on the flavor, that's going to be for anyone. But for me it's what's in the aminos, at a quick glance the first thing I noticed was CLA and natural caffeine .. I thought well this is winning me over already, I grabbed two other aminos I currently used and compared and it was pretty black and white which aminos was better..\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only did I switch to allmax aminos but also glutamine and protein for starters .. I'll definitely try pre workouts and other things down the road . \n",
      "Flavor is awesome! Gives me the push I need specifically on cardio day \n",
      "In love with this product ❤️ Taste amazing \n",
      "\n",
      "Great flavor, great price..what's not to love\n",
      "Great flavor! One of the best I have ever had. Protein is great and a great deal. Up 13 lean lbs this month.\n",
      "Highly recommend this great tasting whey protien. Sometimes I blend it with a handful of blueberries and three or four strawberries for a snack. Also very affordable!\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein is amazing! Mixes very well, just like a milkshake(: while using this protein I have noticed my recovery time cut in half which is awesome. Also noticed it doesn't make me bloat like other powders from the past. In all an awesome product and I highly recommend using Allmax. Strawberry is my favorite flavor(:\n",
      "Only half of the tub was full...\n",
      "So far tried those three with Chocolate to go. And all mix very well with my skim milk. Taste is Phenomenal!!! Recovery seem to be good as well. I usually drink one @ 2pm then hit weights @3:15 and when done drink another one (around 5). And I've seen improvement in strength and recovery. So far a great product. Highly recommend it.\n",
      "PS: IDK if this is because of this protein or because of my small changes in diet, but I have been loosing weight as well, I can only assume fat, since I am in the weight room 5-6 days a week 1-2 hours each session.\n",
      "DELICIOUS!!! Mixes great in skim milk and very creamy and delicious. Just ordered two more, cookies n cream and peanut butter to try out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies and cream tastes like a mcdonalds mcflurry, amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the peanut butter choco, but its an acquired taste of sorts. \n",
      "Grate taste. Mixed easy. Very light on the stomach . Love love love the scoop holder!!!! For once I didn't need to seek out the scoop or find one I already have. I will definitely get this again.\n",
      "Absolutely excellent product.  the flavor is crazy good, very light on the stomach.  mixes really easily.  I've bought every flavor and they all deliver.  highly recommend this especial for the price.  \n",
      "This is one of the best Protien Suppliments that I have tried. I will definitely keep using this product.\n",
      "I have tried many of the popular brands of protein and this is the best tasting stuff on the market. I took some almond coconut milk with a scoop and it was like drinking nestle quick. I want to know how did they get this to taste so good. No after effects. No gasy stomach. Really high quality protein with a great taste.\n",
      "This protein is very good for my stomach. Tastes nice! I have no idea why it is so cheap. I would keep it my daily diet but unfortunately it is high in carbs for me.\n",
      "If I ruled the world, all protein would be able to stand toe to toe with Allmax. If the other flavors are like this, my review shall be expanded. This is a strong but tentative ten for overall gains. After all, that's why we buy them. Great job Allmax\n",
      "Great tasting and has allowed me to keep my lean gains while still shedding fat.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best tasting whey I've ever tasted!!\n",
      "It doesn't make my stomach upset and recovery time is faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is amazing, dissolves great and the amino ratios are amazing. Ive tried different BCAAS and this one takes the trophy by far.\n",
      "I had been using Gaspari Aminolast for a while and wanted to switch it up after the Detonate incident. Allmax impressed me with their manufacturing processes, transparency, and profile, so I decided to give Aminocore+ a shot.\n",
      "I usually take carbs and BCAA's in my workouts, so I mixed this with Key Lime Cherry Carbion (my old cocktail was Glycofuse + Aminolast) and I've gotta say it's a winning combination. Much more energy and endurance, hit a few rep PRs today. Taste is better than most BCAA's I've tried - not quite on the level of Blox or Metabolic's Amino Acids, but not hateful like OG Xtend or Bulk BCAAs.\n",
      "Will be purchasing again and again and again.\n",
      "Great bcaa, its everything you expect at great price. I take during workout, hrlps with recovery and gives extra boost to get through early morning workout. Mixes easily and completely. I have tried key lime cherry and fruit punch both are great not too sweet or have chemical taste like others i have tried.\n",
      "Steve & Amanda Kuclo got me and the girlfriend to try this. This is a good solid 8g of BCAA, perfect for intra workout and also to just sip on throughout your day. The taste is a nice and subtle, not too sweet and not bitter. It's very good and easy to drinkand goes down really smooth, mixes flawlessly unlike most BCAA's. It's a very simple but effective formula and most importantly, it WORKS.\n",
      "Taste sooo amazing. Amino profile is up to par. I like mixing it with a little more leucine  for better protein synthesis. i'd buy it again for sure,got nothing more to say.\n",
      "Love this product , I choose unflavored which I imagine is what chalk tastes like but I don't care for artificial sugars. Good profile but wish it had Glutamine but the added B vitamins are good for energy using it as an intra-workout. Helps me recover and stave off that muscle tear soreness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes great and mixes smooth\n",
      "Amazing taste and just one of the most effective amino acids supplements I've tried! If I made any changes to this, it'd be to add a small dose of beta alanine to the mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed this product.  This probably falls into my top 3 favorite BCAA powders I've tried that are decaffeinated.  I drank this as an intra-workout drink and noticed reduced fatigue in the gym.  It almost felt like it helped sustain my energy levels and focus throughout my workout.  The taste of the Key Lime Cherry reminded me of a yellow Gatorade, so it was pretty good.  There are only two drawbacks to this product from my perspective, 1) The price.  At about $1/serving, this is pretty pricing for an intra workout.  2) The smell of the powder is brutal.  I held my breath when scooping it out of the container and when pouring it into my shaker.  The smell is really disgusting.  I'll probably buy this product again, once on sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product with good ratio of BCAAs and B-complex.  Mixes easily in water and enjoyed the taste of this flavor. I used before and during my workout and noticed more energy and endurance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Been using for about 2 years now.  This is a great BCAA product. Usually get the Key Lime Cherry which tastes great but most recently purchased the flavorless version in an effort to decrease the amount of artificial sweetener I consume.    I mix in True lemon packet and that seems to work fine as a flavoring source.  I drink this before and during my workouts because I train at 345 am on an empty stomach and I feel better training.  \n",
      "This is probably my favorite thing to drink when I workout. Personally I believe amino acid is essential to promoting muscle mass and recovery. So when I saw this one I was excited to try it. It mixes really well over other Amino Acids which usually foam up at the top that I've tried whereas this one doesn't. I've also noticed that the taste is more clean and doesn't taste like chemicals, and tastes more like a juice than anything else. Highly recommended on flavor alone among other things.\n",
      "Taste is meh and chalky.  I use this as an intra-workout and I get better results and lasting effects from other products.  I will not buy this again.\n",
      "Awesome product\n",
      "Bought this because I had tried a sample at my gym. I was instantly hooked because of the flavour. Delicious! \n",
      "I bought the big tub because it was cheaper per serving and totally worth every penny. I believe it helped me on the road to my success. I am DEFINATLEY buying again!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a rapid anabolic state in your body. With quick recovery. This will do the trick. I love this stuff. Its highly concentrated. Fine powder. Smells like Koolaid. Mixes really well.  I have seen my results with this product. I definately recomend to anyone looking to set their body chemistry into that anabolic state within 15 mins of ingesting this product before, during or after their workout. I use this and it works.\n",
      "Great BCAA product that contains good high doses. The Caribbean Splash flavor is not the greatest  tasting however.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried Aminocore because I fell in love with Razor 8.  The profile looked solid in it so I decided to go ahead and get some.  I took this supplement first thing in the morning before breakfast; because that is when I get the greatest benefit from aminos.  I have to say that this is one of the best on the market.  I did notice a boost in recovery from the workouts the night before.  Aminocore tends to have a great price, and the Key Lime Cherry flavor tastes like a Sonic slush.  On the other hand, Caribbean Splash tastes like Caribbean A**.   Overall, a great supplement and will continue using.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing product! Has all the Aminos you need (and at a level that will actually make a difference) and a ridiculous amount of servings. Taste is pretty good for a supplement. (Tastes kind of like crappy Kool-Aid)\n",
      "Allmax Aminocore is the best tasting BCAA product I have ever tasted!!  Rather than buying bottled water, I put a scoop of Aminocore in my water all day- before, during, and after my workouts.....every day!\n",
      "so far in my opinion Aminocore is the best BCAA product out and the Key Lime Cherry tastes amazing. if it wasn't so much $$$ I'd drink it all day and quadruple my dose around workout time\n",
      "Great product! mixes well, tastes great and is priced well.\n",
      "Im a HUGE Bcaa user an believer, ive tried just about everyone out there and aminocore tops them all  from flavor to the ingredients in my opinion best branch chain supplement hands down and the key lime kicks a$$ :) \n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried the Caribbean Splash and Fruit Punch and this by far is the best tasting.  Will be buying this flavor exclusively.\n",
      "Overall the flavour was excellent, the results are also excellent, I can really feel the difference when I dont use it.  A really great product.\n",
      "Best BCAA's  product I have ever taken. 8 grams in one scoop is just amazing, I recover much faster and my muscles are not sore from my workouts (yes, I train hard)  and it also tastes great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the 100 plus servings, it's been almost 3 months and still have some left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome stuff!!\n",
      "\n",
      "As of late, I've been paying more attention to supplements that are proprietary blends.  AllMax Nutrition's Aminocore isn't a proprietary blend. They also have a **** good product.  This is one of the better BCAA's that I've used.  The ratio of Leucine, Isoleucine, and Valine are pretty **** good.  It did take a little getting use to the taste, but only for the first day or two.  What I like most is my ability to recover fast and not be sore the next day or two after a hard workout. In fact, It allows me to go even harder the next day in the gym.  You've to get this if you are serious about you workout. \n",
      "I love this product because of the amount of aminos along with b vitamins. I take in the middle of my workout and gives me that extra push to finish my last workouts. No other products that I know of offer this kind of quality, you need just pure aminos with just a push which  b vitamins help there. I've  seen other products and they just add way too much stuff its not about quantity its about quality of the product! Also the blue raspberry is my favorite flavor good taste.\n",
      "Aminocore is awesome, it mixes perfectly and tastes great. Although it can be costly, I will continue to keep this supplement staple in my stack.\n",
      "Didn't get much out of this product. Key lime cherry was horrible tasting, but wouldn't really care about the taste if it worked. Used it intra workout and saw no change in recovery between sets. Only got about 30 servings out of the 45 servings label. It did give me a nice pick me up on non-training day mornings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "excellent product\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best BCAA products I've ever tried. Recovery is great, I drink at least one serving a day outside of the gym, plus the serving for intra-workout. I like this product a lot. Key Lime Cherry flavor was a little funky at first, but it grows on you. The science behind this product is great too, flash frozen for best mix-ability possible, and jam packed with aminos. Just over 8 grams, I think, which is a pretty sizable number compared to other products. This is the only ALLMAX product I've tried, but since I've had success with this I'll probably try more. Product is also a good deal too, 100-ish servings has lasted me forever and I think I paid between 50-60 bucks. Not a bad deal at all. Would definitely recommend to the individual that is serious about recovery and endurance.\n",
      "This stuff is awesome, it's definitely helped me get more shredded than other during workout drinks that I've tried. I'm buy the big one this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing product! I have used BSN's AminoX, Scivation's Xtend, MusclePharm's Amino1, and Controlled Labs' Purple Wraath. Out of all these BCAA products I would rank Aminocore 2nd in terms of intra-workout performance. It does the job very well, but I thin AminoX takes the lead by a hairline just because of the larger dose of amino acids. Oh well. Flavour-wise, this product is a knockout! Hands down the best tasting bcaa product ever tried by me. It's not sweet, (caribbean splash) and it just 'dances' with your taste buds without being aggressive or too shy. Its mixability? Winner by a clear shot, again. I just pour the scoop in my 1.25 ltr bottle and it dissolves almost too easily. barely need to shake it!!\n",
      "tastes good, mixes well. i believe it helps me.\n",
      "Contents are good for BCAAs purposes, however, the flavour of tropical splash tastes like chalk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carribean splash is tasty but i wish that i wouldhave gone with another one. It mixes nice is great to mix your creatine and glutamine in\n",
      "TASTE LIKE ****,DOES NOT MIX WELL,OVER ALL ****TY.......\n",
      "\n",
      "There is results !! But I will not give it 10 because I spent one hour trying to open it !! And I opened it by 5 screwdrivers .. Anyhow, it deserve 9 :)\n",
      " As for taste- It can be a little sweet, especially the tropical flavor- but for every few sips I take of it, I also follow it up with water. My workouts have gotten more intense and since this is the only supp I have change since October- I feel it is due to Aminocores blend of BCAAs and B Vitamins. 8g of BCAAs compared to the 2g I was taking pre and post.\n",
      "Have been using this product for a few weeks after getting it on wheycheap.com. In terms of performance and effects its comparable to Xtend, Atomic-7 and Intrabolic. Mixability is good to, as it does not have the 'post shaking' foam that Xtend has. The only downside is the taste. It's bitter, it's unpleasant, I do not look forward to drinking it. Taste is not a big issue with me but you can get something that tastes better, similar cost, similar profile ie Xtend and Atomic 7.\n",
      "After using this product for approximately 3 weeks now I am absolutely stunned by how this works. I have stacked this with Musclepharm Assault and the two products complement each other unbelievably. I notice that my muscles do not seem to tire out nearly as quickly during a heavy workout now. I feel that I can just keep going and that I can add more weight. Since I have been using PWO's and some of the other pre-workout type products for quite some time now this is one of the better products i have ever purchased that actually does something. It is actually making a difference in my workouts. I will continue buying this product. One warning though (and I hope the company is reading this...)The smell and taste of the Rapid Release Tablets is so incredibly bad that I had a hell of a time swallowing the pills when I first tried it. It is an unbelievably bad smell to this product (think rotting garbage on a hot summer day... i'm not kidding)Make sure you swallow the pills quickly and DO NOT LET THE PILLS SIT ON YOUR TOUNGE FOR LONGER THAN A SECOND!!! almost guaranteed you will throw up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best tasting BCAAs you can buy. It also mixes better that Extend. I always feel better when taking.\n",
      "Gives me the right amount of energy and focus during workouts. Just as effective during your workout as Size On but without the protein and carbs. Definitely recommended!\n",
      "A product is simply perfect.\n",
      " I have also used Scivation and Modern BCAA, good products but either because of price per serving or taste I wouldn't buy them again.\n",
      "Great intra-workout product. It mixes well, has a decent taste, and is definitely the best bang for your buck when it comes to BCAAs. I am definitely seeing improvements in my recovery as well as the amount of strength I am retaining during a 12-week cut. I am very impressed with this product and would use it again for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the price and servings I couldn't pass up the sale. I mix it with2 and a half scoops of jacked 3d micro and use it as an intra workoit. I've noticed my lifting sessions are longer and more explosives and also I don't feels as drained after I lift. Not sure if it's the jacked or tbe bcaas itself but definitely think the product is a good deal! Taste wise it's kindof awful I can only drink it if it's mixed with something. Also I dug inside the container for 20 minutes until my hands were covered in powder just to figure out there is no scooper. All in all it's a good buy! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this product.  I use it because it has no artificial colors or sweeteners.  I've never had a problem dissolving the powder into water in a blender bottle.  I use this product intra-workout during my weightlifting workouts as well as during my cardio sessions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the way I use the product: Because the taste isn't great (it's pure amino acids) I mix it with a very small amount of a flavored amino acid to mask the bitterness.  I like using it this way better than using a flavored product because I find the flavorings in those products to be too strong when using a full dose.  My ratio is typically about 10 grams of Allmax BCAA to 3 grams of a flavored amino acid product, such as scivation xtend.  \n",
      "Yes, there is some bitterness, but if you are working out hard, it doesn't really matter because you are so thirsty!  If your biggest concern is taste, you should just drink gatoraid, but if you want results, use this.\n",
      "Taste was not good, and mixability was not possible. But i hear that is to be expected from BCAA's. I do not know. Wont try this again. If you do buy, mix it into water and add some flavoring. and dont plan on drinking it for a good 15 to 20 minutes. thats about how long it takes for it to dissolve into the water. It will not mix, so dont even try, you have to let it dissolve. \n",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It will ruin any protein shake and it mixes terribly.   Tastes extremely bitter, highly s****est going with a different brand like Optimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the reason that i set this low score to this product  for numerous of reason. i got around 8 months using the product,  which in that period i had consumed around 5 bottle of 400grms. the first 2 bottles taste excellent, unflavored, with not sour or bitter taste. but in my 3th bottle, they change something in the compound or formula instead of be tasteless, is not taste like bitter, very strong. but on the last bottle, they had change again the taste, and now is bitter, sour and like baking soda, now when you close the into a bottle for drink during the workout, when you open looks you are opening a cocacola candy.\n",
      "\n",
      "im really dissapoint it with them. obviously in terms of quality before they change the compound, i can say give me the result\n",
      "Dont waste your money on this crap, i have been using bcaa's for years and i always buy products that have the (ajipure stamp on the front of their products), so like a dummy i decided to give these a try since i had alredy purchased other stuff from allmax and it wasnt so bad but this is horrible, first of all the first day i used them on a shake it says unflavored but it totally ruined my shake the taste was horrible, never happened before with (ajipure aminos), it was like some horrible medicine, i made at least 6 or 7 more shakes in a couple of days with everything you can imagine, bananas, e.t.c, and no matter what one little teaspoon of this and all you can taste is that awful taste and also if you shake it in a shaker cup it foams up like a bubble bath and wants to explode out of the glass, i will stick to (ajipure) and you should to, this stuff sucks!!!!!\n",
      "I give a 3/10 for the taste and 4/10 to dissolve, but i think it's a great bcaa supplement for muscle mass\n",
      "Couldn't use. Tastes REALLY bitter. Tried 2 times - pure with a glass of water (awful) and mixed with water (didn't dissolve at all). Maybe this is a great pharmaceutical quality but not for me. \n",
      "I add this to my pre workout every morning and have another scoop with my BCAAs during the beginning of my workout. I absolutely love the energy I have and then maintain during my early morning workouts. These carbs have really helped me on leg days especially. I'd recommend this to anyone who feels like they burn out during their early morning workouts.\n",
      "An excellent product, I would recommend this to any of my friends and have gave scoops out at the gym for people to try. Everyone had very good reactions to it. I like to pour 1 scoop of the fruit punch into a 1.5 liter bottle and sip on it through my entire workout, saving a little bit of it to chug as I finish up. I don't get as tired and it's nice having a bit of a flavor to enjoy rather than sip on water. The fruit punch tastes like those red tube popsicles I ate when I was a kid. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good job guys!\n",
      "Excellent amount of extra energy for maxing out on every set! I highly recommend stacking this with Tribx90, CVol and Muscle Prime! Thanks Allmax!\n",

      "Taste great, doesn't mix up great but if you make it the night before and leave it the fridge 👍 ......also really good mixed with a scoop of blue raspberry Aminocore \n",
      "Taste is awfull. Feel bloated after drinking it. \n",
      "Like the product a lot but for f*cks sake it did not come with a scoop. Spent an hour going through 5.4 pounds of powder looking for the scoop it was a mess, I even dumped out all the powder from the container trying to find it. Ended up using my own scale for measurement. \n",
      "Very good product \n",
      "I honestly love this stuff. The flavor is great and it's a terrific option for a quick and dirty pre-workout drink. I'm currently taking it with a glucose disposal agent and I really feel like the combination takes this product to another level. As a standalone supplement CARBION delivers. With a good GDA it's pure gold. \n",

      "This product is great! Great carb booster before workout, and great energy. There were a few chunks at the bottom but nothing terrible. I also used it as a POST, works great noticed the overall recovery was fast and the product did not make me feel bloated. I stacked this with ANABOLIC STATE. Both are hand in hand great. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to add size and wants a great recovery.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Great product for a great price. I have tried a lot of different carb products and this is by far my favorite. Seen some good gains stacking this with my protein post workout. This product helps me recover very well. \n",
      "For the longest time I have not used any additional carb to my pre/intra workout drinks. Since I had to switch early morning weight trainings with no fuel in my body, this together with my pre-workout of choice propels me through those 5am sessions. It makes a significant difference vs. running on empty. In addition, I started using Carbion+ for my kickboxing classes, especially when I doubling up classes, it helps me to push through and give my best for two hours. I picked the flavorless, works great with any of my BCAAs or pre workout drinks. Even if you are like I was i.e. try to avoid extra carbs, give it a shot - it is a great product around training time, with great carb and electrolytes profile.\n",

      "Absolutely fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a naturally skinny guy, blessed and cursed with a high metabolism. I'm not going to train without a peri-workout carb again. I'd HAPPILY cease my use of preworkout in favour for a quick carb like this (to keep my budget happy).\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps as I'm relatively new to this product, or that its THAT good, I can definitely FEEL the benefits of this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommended.\n",
      "I limit my carbs in general but use Carbion for intra workout. Great product. It fuels my workout and gives me a much needed increase in energy during my workout. \n",
      "I get a much better pump with increase stamina and strength. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a solid product for post-workout recovery. I use the unflavored and put it in my shake with banana. It's a ton better than using dextrose to spike insulin levels and has really helped my muscles 'fill' after a strenuous workout. I definitely recommend. \n",
      "Good but taste...\n",
      "Excellent product. Some great quality carbs here for a post workout shake. Seeing some great results using this product. Highly recommended. The Key Lime Cherry is great. Depending on the protein flavor, it mixes brilliantly with some flavors.\n",
      "Ive only tried a select few carb supplements, so out of the few this is by far the best! i can down a shake post workout an no bloating at all BIG plus. i have the key lime cherry which taste is top notch in flavor. So far i love this product and the convenience of having fast carbs post workout with electrolytes as a bonus highly recommend if your looking for a carb drink\n",
      "Great for drinking during your workout. Little to no fatigue after taking this stuff. I'll be buying it again!\n",
      "mixed well with my pre ,during, post workout. noticed a lot of energy quicker recovery time. awesome product.\n",
      "I love this product because I get good clean energy without stimulants, no bloating and help me recover since that's the most important time of all. I mix it with my protein and creatine pre and post. The key lime cherry is sweet but I prefer unflavored to mix with my protein, it does however make my protein shake thicker but ive had the worst and best taste of all products so I just down anything as long as they work lol.\n",
      "The bomb enough said............\n",
      "Mixes very well and mixes well with any flavor of protein. I use it post workout for immediate carbs in my protein shake. \n",
      "I received a free sample and had a good experience, so I decided to give it a try. I have been using it about two weeks now (intra-workout) and have to say this is by far the best product I have used for intra-workout. I have tried numerous amino acid products and other intra-workout but nothing compares so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use about 1.5 scoops on leg day and 1 scoop on other workout days and sip throughout the workout. My focus has been excellent and do not seem to get tired. I have experienced no bloating or digestive issues. Drinking this intra workout is a great way to spare muscle glycogen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though it has only been a couple weeks I feel stronger and don't get worn down during the workout. I haven't experienced great pumps, but my muscles feel fuller during the workout. If you are looking for an intra-workout I highly recommend!\n",
      "Wow, very good carbs, provide energy for intense workout.....definetly recomend....a++++\n",

      "First off, this isn't candy. It didn't taste \"good\". I chose to order this product regardless of the bad reviews since I frequently use Allmax products. I noticed the negative comments were primarily given based on the taste. However, Allmax is a company that would rather sacrifice flavor in order to give you a more pure, quality product minus unnecessary fillers. (Research Leicine and compare to Allmax's version) The serving is just a teaspoon. I take mine with a little water... like a shot if you will. It's not like you're taking a large shake full of nasty, where taste would be critical. As far as performance, which is what really matters, I have reached new max's on several exercises. I have taken test boosters (herbs) and noticed a difference but test boosters (that don't have AA) plus + AA from Allmax = best mode even outside of the gym ;) I can say that AA has really helped me reach goals I set despite the fact I'm not sleeping as much as I should.

      "\n",
      "Taste like pure garbage \n",
      "Works brah\n",
      "Didn't feel any different \n",
      "It provided some pump and some strength increases, and I stacked it with muscle prime, but nothing astonishing. Its still worth a try though. It didnt have any beta or creatine and that was my biggest reason for trying it.  I think it could use a real good dose of caffeine. \n",
      "A great Nitric Oxide booster. It works month after month. No more muscle burn.  Workout till the sun goes down \n",
      "Excellent product, excellent value for money!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my first non stimulant pre workout.I wanted to cut off caffeine completely from my system and I went with,HemaNOvol.Thing is,the pump wasn't all that,maybe if i took 10pills,im 250lbs the normal dosage really didn't do it for me.Now if i stack it with Jack3d,or 1MR,OR Neurocore(these are my favorite pre workout stimulants containing caffeine of course)I'm sure the experience would intensify greatly\n",
      "Allmax did a heck of a marketing job on the product label.  When you read the caution, you think your in for the biggest pump of your life.  Anything but.  This pump was just average for me.  Next time I will try straight AAKG powder instead.\n",
      "Should have ordered SNS's Agmatine instead...  I'm ethier a non responder OR this product is weaksauce and need to be over dosed for those of us that are over 300 lbs.  Been on this product for 3 weeks now and have seen nothing of what the manufacturer has stated nor anything that many reviews have had to say.  Overall I am highly disappointed.  I guess I will up my dose by 2 pills each day until I see and feel something.  Won't hold my breath though, I'm discouraged that this is such a lack luster product...\n",
      " Alpha Cuts. I started using this product last month solely as a mental enhancer. I was skeptic at first, as a pilot who works and fly everyday with heavy mental workload. Alpha Cuts was able to get me going. I didnt feel any side effects such as dizzyness or nervousness, infact i was alert, confident and calm. I combine it with Magnesium supplement and oh wow, i was calm as a rock and very alert. Make sure you have adequet meal and nutrients otherwise, youll crash. Good thing about this product is if you have proper meal (no skip) Then, youll feel nothing, unlike energy drinks that will drain you out and crash. This thing works like a charm! And the bonus part is its thermogenic effect. I noticed after few days, My stomach have gone flatter! Im amazed considering it onl have small scoop. But like they said, quality over quantity. Now, i am trying raspberry. Regarding about its price, not bad. $.50 per scoop. Just like whey protein! Kind of funny but, i am motivated to wake up everymorning to take this. And keep me out of bed whenever my alarm bugs me out.\n",
      "This is the best BCAAs I've ever had. I'm half way through my second tub and I'm going to continue buying it. The feeling I get during my training has improved. I'm seeing much better results than I have with other products. Of course you will not see much results if you're not eating right. I hate fruit punch in any product, but this one actually taste really good. \n",
      "I've tried a verity of Preworkouts and they take at least two scoops to kick in, Upload will only take me one scoop and the energy level will be amazing can argue with it, and the taste is amazing \n",
      "This is my new favorite pre-workout!  I was burned out on my previous pre-workout and since this was new I wanted to give it a try.  The flavors are amazing!  Usually I had to choke down the other brands just to get the buzz, but both of these flavors are enjoyable.  It gave me sustained energy through the workout but didn't had the burning sensation side effect.\n",
      "amazing energy and focus\n",
      "Positives:\n",
      "The flavor was fantastic. If anything probably one of the best flavors I've ever tasted. \n",
      "It hits quick and gives a pretty solid boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negatives:\n",
      "The boost and pump are kinda like a bottle rocket. It's quick and then it's over. If you don't have a super intense workout then it could work out great. It's a solid preworkout if you have a medium workout. But for me the energy didn't last. I wouldn't buy it again at it's current price only because they're are better preworkouts that worked better for ME around the same price. But if it ever gets a bogo deal I'd definitely buy again.\n",
      "This definitely gave me some energy and a good pump. I will be reordering this\n",
      "Upload is a great product !!!  I The Pump i got during my workout was amazing,maybe my best  . i haven't  felt this strong and look my most vascular ever. I am usually a sceptical supplement believer. Upload is different and made me a believer. I cant wait to see and feel my results in a few months. I really liked the Watermelon flavor.I highly recommend upload to anybody who wants that extra strength,focus and edge during training.\n",
      "This stuff is great! Sure the taste can be a bit off-putting if you're expecting a sugar packed protein powder, but I've had much much worse tasting stuff. But as far as the ingredients go, this stuff is great! I've been taking this for the past 2 months every morning and I think it's great. Did I already say this stuff is great? Seriously. This is a great bang for the buck purchase.\n",
      "I love the Cafe Mocha flavor. I usually put 8-10oz of skim milk with an additional 4oz of water and it tastes great! I take this shake every morning and with the combination of fiber and caffeine, it sure does get my bowels going every morning. I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone who drinks coffee and would like a substitute so it doesn't color your teeth as bad. Definite game changer!\n",
      "I really wanted to like this supplement. It seemed like a great value, but unfortunately I couldn't get past the taste. I thought the vanilla chai would be good as a smoothie, but it's terrible. It smells gross and tastes horrid and the aftertaste is even worse. Just don't even bother with this product... unless you don't have tastebuds. \n",
      "I love the Capsules, I primarily use the powder in my cooking but I don't always cook, which is where these super portable little guys come in. LOVE IT!\n",
      "I already have a good mixed diet including vegetables, so I mainly bought this as supplementing with sea greens has been recommended for CFS. I was also hoping the probiotics would help my IBS/digestive problems. Although expensive, it has one of the most comprehensive ingredients list amongst similar products.\n",
      "\n",
      "It tastes vile! (But that means it's doing you good right?) So the taste didn't bother me - I just knocked it back. I kept it in the fridge and used as directed for a month. Although I didn't notice any change in my energy levels/sleep/CFS-type symptoms, my digestion/bowels was much improved for the month I was taking it - this was taking it straight after my main meal in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the price I would not buy it regularly (it was discounted when I bought it), but I certainly recommend trying it if you have specific needs.\n",
      "I use this mid ride when I do long bike rides 40+ miles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easy to digest, pretty good tasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use the Amino HP as my intra-workout, and it makes a difference! I've tried icy blue razz and pineapple - both are good, but I prefer the blue razz slightly.  Amino HP doesn't have caffeine, so I usually add a couple of scoops of ON's amino energy blue razz flavor to this to boost the flavor and add some caffeine, plus I add a scoop of arginine ... makes a great intra-workout!! Will definitely keep buying this one.\n",
      "Arrived quickly, and was great tasting. The flavor was really good and not to overwhelming or bitter.  The powder was very light and easy dissolvable\n",
      "I love this!  I take 1-2 scoops at night before I go to work.  I also take it before cardio and I love how it makes me feel.  I make sure I always have this product on hand.\n",
      "I got the 10 dose sample and I'm glad I didn't spend money on it. \n",
      " I had high expectation seeing as ritual is one of my favorite pre-workouts.\n",
      "I took one scoop and felt absolutely nothing.  so I tried 1.5.. still nothing.\n",
      "at 2 scoops I got the runs but that's it. no energy, no thermo  affect.. nothing.\n",
      "the only good thing I can say is that the tastes good. \n",
      "Flavor is great.  I was using this as my afternoon pick-me-up at the office when I was running out of energy and needed the caffeine (I don't drink coffee).  This was my way to avoid hitting the vending machine at work when I felt afternoon snack cravings or my energy going down.  Or, I'd use it in the morning on rest days for the day's pick-me-up.  It did its job- I just found I developed a tolerance for it pretty quickly.  I will cycle this and use it again.\n",
      "They didn't add electric to name just for fun....its strong taste but you get used to it....get ready to sweat...increases core temp...I did 1 1/2 scoops morning and 1 scoop lunch...lost weight\n",
      "First off, I am not a jacked dude getting paid to write this and I will give my most honest opinion. I am the average joe who was looking for some help with weight loss. I have only been using this product for a few days but I am feeling the benefits from it already. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each morning I eat breakfast at work and I take this stuff as I walk through the door as I do my usual morning prep. I take two scoops in the morning and depending on my mood another scoop in the afternoon. This is one of the only weight loss supps that I have used that continued to work for me for more than 3 days. Everything else I have used works great for the first day or two then the effects stop. This stuff just keeps working and working. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this when they had buy the 60 get a 10 free. After reading other reviews I went with the Pineapple Passionfruit as my 60 and Lime as the 10. Do not make my mistake! That pineapple passionfruit smells and taste like butt!! The taste is terrible! The Lime is just like Lime jello and it tastes amazing! But you only mix this with 8 oz of water so you can just chug it and get it over with as fast as possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would of given this product a 10 if it was not for the terrible taste of that pineapple! SERIOUSLY IT TASTE LIKE BUTT!! Learn from me and just stick with the Lime! Great product and a great company! \n",
      "This mixes very well and tastes absolutely outstanding, so the taste gets a \"10\"...however, the effects weren't anything great.  It's a nice morning alternative to coffee because it does perk you up a little, but it didn't give me \"incredible\" energy and definitely not much of a thermo effect.  To me this was like having a good energy drink when feeling a little sluggish.  So if you want a nice little boost, then this is a good product...if you want a thermo/sweat/amp'd effect then I would recommend trying something different.\n",
      "amazing product, I've been using it for a while and i love it... great results \n",
      "Using for 2 weeks now taste is amazing but i feel no effects of thermo or any energy says no more than 3 schoops but i even tried on 3 and i still feel nothing it taste like juice thats the only best quality about it i can personally say. 7/10\n",
      "I took this for 3 days. The first day was awesome! Kept me going and helped cut some water. Day 2 wasnt so awesome, i didnt feel anything. Day 3 I took 2 scoop in the morning and it still had no effect. This product is junk. It only got a 2 because it mixes well and taste good.\n",
      "This stuff is good.  Im about to order some more soon.  The electric lime taste pretty good and everyone say the passion flavor is better so I will try that one.  The energy it gives you is great.  You could use this product as a pre workout.\n",
      "I really couldn't tell the difference in my energy levels, but also it got clumpy after a while so I ended up throwing away\n",
      "Tried 2 - 10 serving samples, flavor is decent but not as potent as i hoped. One jar got all clumpy half way through. \n",
      "gives energy and the runs lol but overall will continue using it\n",
      "This fat burner taste good and does give results. I do not feel any energy while on this but thats okay! will buy again.\n",
      "tastes great and in my first week i burned off over 1% bodyfat without even changing my fitness routine! i look forward to starting every day with this delicious energizing flavor and i look forward to my weekly weigh-ins!\n",
      "I'm finishing up my second tub of ANS Diablo. While I haven't felt the thermogenic effect everytime, it has provided me with a nice clean energy. Coupled with weight training and cardio, I've noticed a slight change in my midsection. I have NOT lost weight, although it does appear that I have since I can see /some/ abs.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only gripe with Diablo is that it claims to have 60 servings (serving size = 1 scoop, therefore 60 scoops per tub). I began on January 9 with 1 serving, and have taken 3 servings daily since. Doing some math, my 120 total servings across 2 tubs should last me until February 17. Judging by what's left, I'll be hard-pressed to finish this week (only about 30 days). I'm estimating there are closer to 45 servings per tub instead of 60. BB and ANS... thoughts on that?\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of this, I've been satisfied and I'll order another two tubs to give myself a little more time to see some results. In the past I've been too quick to pull the plug on my training efforts when I didn't see near-instant results. I'm going to play the game and be patient this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, ANS! You've got a great product here. Just check on those servings. :)\n",
      "I don't want to say its garbage but I've been on it for over a month and haven't noticed any changes. Won't be buying any test boosters again as this experience turned me off of them.\n",
      "I agree with all other reviews. I tried all other \"mass gainers\" I even went with the philosophy of \"train hard,eat big\" and all I got was bloated, (pretty discouraging) see my progress photos. This is my protein for life. Thanks for taking time to read my review.\n",
      "This is my go to pre-workout, and I love it! In fact, I haven't really felt the need to try anything else since getting on the Ritual train. It gives me a super clean rush of energy that never fails to carry me through an entire workout. The energy is great, but the mental clarity and focus are what really separate Ritual from the pack. Dendrobium is where its at, and I'm very surprised so few companies use it. If you are lifting seriously, you will most likely need two scoops, but it's like that with most pres. Its also no coincidence that the bad reviews of this product seem to all be written by people who don't really lift (sad but true...). You will not regret trying Ritual, trust me.\n",
      "I tried this after seeing that a person I follow on Bodyspace uses this as her go-to pre-workout.  Definitely felt great using it, felt it kick in right away.  I did find I got used to it pretty quickly so I will cycle this with other pre-workouts.  Love the ingredients with vitamins, creatine, caffeine, etc. all in one. My only wish was that they could not use artificial dyes for the coloring.  Great taste.\n",
      "Amazing pre workout with an incredible taste! I've tried ON, pre-kaged, and c4 and this is by far the best one I have tried both for its effects and taste. I highly recommend the peach mango twist flavor!\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid pwo with no hype or gimmicks if you know your stuff the label alone sells it.\n",
      "I figure I can review this honestly after using it for 2+ weeks on my workout days. I also see a lot of people reviewing this based on samples they got. Which really isn't good cause a sample is not enough for you to make an honest and unbiased review. Why I say this? Cause the first serving I took (1.5 scoops), it was niiiiiice. I got the tingly feeling in my hands and body and just felt like a beast straight up. However, AFTER that initial workout....I figured my tolerance was still high so I up'd it to 2 scoops since that is the recommended dosage in order to get the maximum effects. Well, all I can say is....it let me down. Some days I feel like a beast and some days, I don't feel the PWO hit me at all. After that initial first serving, the effects definitely dimmed down. The effects are still there though, just not as greatly. Pump is probably the best factor about this PWO. You can get some insane pumps haha (watch out leg day!).  Taste wise, this is pretty bad. But I've said it again and again, who cares. If it delivers the performance you want, the taste is the last thing to worry about. But to give you an idea, it tastes like Kool-Aids blue drink mixed with medicine. Pretty awful but I power shoot it so I get it in me as fast as possible w/o thinking about the taste. Last but not least, this stuff makes me go to the bathroom every time after my workouts lol. Taking a #2 and seeing the inside of my toilet turn blue is not the best sight. I'ma finish my tub and move back to PreJYM or try another PWO out. This stuff is good but not great. I understand different PWO's work for different people, but I'm seeing a lot of reviews by people who got samples sent to them by ANS and that can throw you off on making your decision so be careful. \n",
      "P.S taking 2 scoops per serving = 20-22 servings only in a 45serving tub. So what does that tell you? This may have a great profile, but its underdosed like a lot of PWO's on the market. So unless you don't mind cutting your tub in half, then go for it.\n",
      "A great pre-workout with a great profile and price. Good energy and decent pumps. I'd recommend trying it. The fruit fusion tasted great and mixes perfectly. \n",
      "I tried this product based on reviews that I had seen around the internet like on suppwiththat.com and priceplow.com and to take a break from PreJym and to see if there was any truth to the hype. This stuff really reminded me of Craze but without a sense of amphetamine-induced paranoia. Excellent focus and determination in the gym, a bit more raw energy as opposed to the longer, cleaner feeling with PreJym. Taste is strong, but decent- I recommend mixing in a lot of water! This is definitely a two-scoop per workout product in order to get the clinically recommended doses of the important ingredients that are disclosed here. I will definitely keep this one in rotation in the future!\n",
      "Taste wasn't bad. Didn't give me the kick I was looking for, the ingredients in this product are impressive. \n",
      "This didn't give me very much energy, but it did give some good pumps and it tastes great!\n",
      "I've tried several pre-workout supps. Besides NO Xplode, most others did not have creatine as the primary active ingredient. Pretty good lasting energy through a workout. Little bit of the niacin skin itch/tingle. After my workouts, I usually felt pretty solid/pumped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would definitely recommend the Peach-Mango flavor.\n",
      "Decent not great for me.  Background - I've used C4, metrx, and MP Assault and I'd put Ritual above all except for C4.  I hit the gym pretty early most days (5 am) and this simply didn't have enough stims in it for me to the point where I usually ended up downing a cup of coffee after taking this.  I did take a stim break before using this but that didn't seem to matter.  I usually took 2 scoops as well which makes it a little on the pricey side per serving. I had good, not great workouts, and decent pumps.  I can certainly see why some love this stuff and the blend of ingredients is top notch.  I did notice that my energy was sustained throughout my workouts (usually 90 minutes) which is a definite plus since I lift heavy and then do tabata and steady state cardio.  The watermelon flavor was very good and blends well with Hemavol Watermelon if you are into that.  It mixed decently but not as well as some others.  In summary, good not great for me but based on other reviews definately worth a shot if you aren't a stim junkie.  Simply wasn't the best for me and that has more to do with my early workouts and my body than the product.\n",

      "Very odd taste and never got the intensity and focus of other pre workouts\n",
      "I definitely like this pwo and would purchase again!\n",
      "\n",
      "love this pre  workout wicked watermelon was ok .i bought the 30 serve  couple month ago for $24.99.why is the price gone up to $59 ??????????\n",

      "Great focus, energy and pumps.\n",

      "Well, where do I start?  \n",
      "How about i say that ever since Craze got taken off the market I've been searching high and low for a new PWO... I tried Game Day, D-Stunner, Platinum Pre-, Assault, Neurocore, and Nano Vapor... All of those did little to nothing for me.  Then I found Ritual.  Ritual had all the ingredients I like to see, and then some!  Plus it was on a Buy 2 Get 1... So why not?  I bought the three tubs, and boy! I was LUCKY!   It worked SO good the first time but I was skeptical that it would work that good again... So I treid it again, and again, and again, and ten to fifteen times after that... And it NEVER stopped working... This product is AMAZING.  I've been working out for four years and the workouts i have with Ritual are at the top of my best workouts list.\n",
      "I love this product. Energy, endurance and strength are unmatched. The product profile is solid, and gives all the quality ingredients that you need for performance. Everything is disclosed for the key ingredients. Then you have a blend for the stims, and let me tell you, it is a great blend. With the exception of the Dendrobium (which is questionable whether or not it has stimulating effects) all of the other ingredients are spot on, and they seem to work great together. I am very tolerant of stims, but this puts me in a great mindset and and get's me focused on my lifts. Mixability is perfect, taste is good. Not the best i've tasted, but certainly drinkable. This is becoming one of my go to PWO's. \n",
      "Good profile, good price. Needs 2scoops to deliver.\n",
      "Love this pre-workout, all around great and effective. I've tasted better but still tastes fine.\n",
      "First Pre-wo, that on 150mg caffeine (having high tolerance to stims) did not gave me any crash/lethargy..\n",
      "\n",
      "Felt much more easier to focus while training. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although the flavour could be improved, i did like that it didn�t contain much die..\n",
      "\n",
      "anyway, mixing it with other pre-wo (stim free), watermelon or Orange flavours, tasted great, as it doesn�t show up that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice vascularity, pump OK, focus OK\n",
      "For the price and servings, it's a good option.\n",
      "Was looking for a Craze replacement, this is it.  Great focus and extreme energy with wild pumps.  Love this product.\n",
      "I am always trying out the new preworkouts soon after they come out and I have to tell you this one is special if you're looking for energy and focus. It also seems to give me that happy feeling. I rarely leave reviews but I had to on this. I don't know if it's the dendrobium or the PEA but man this is a favorite of mine. A must have before my workouts, and this review is after consuming two tubs over the past 5 months, not after one or two servings.\n",
      "Flavor like the other articals is not the best but tolleratable.  I personally like nerocore for the value and the small serving size.  All these products seem similar but if i would rate the ones ive tried: nerocore #1 jackd#2, Ritual #3 no shotgun and no explode about the same for #4.  \n",
      "Overall I would say is a good pre workout for beginner but not stim junkie.\n",
      "I'm a stim junkie and I do not get much of the energy, endurance, strength and focus.\n",
      "If you would want to relate this to craze because of the dendrobium ingredients, I would say craze wins it .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor taste was just okay. Pre workout flavorings aren't a big deal to me since you just kill it anyway and not going to be sipping it over a period of time. Energy was decent. Focus was okay. Pump was lacking. This is just another average product \n",
      "Ritual is the best pre workout I have tried. Crazy good energy, focus, pump, and just great all around results. As far as performance it is perfect, but the taste is not great. But when it performs this well, I can definitely look past that!\n",
      "This stuff has a great nutrient profile, and a great taste. Not to mention, it's only $30 for 35 servings!\n",
      "Excellent pre, number 1 in my list right now.\n",
      "I received this as a sample.  I have tried many preworkout supps and this was great.  No crash, no jitters, and I blew away my workout this morning.  The apple flavor was pretty good, and went down easy.  I would definitely recommend this supplement.\n",
      "I am a huge craze fan and since this has the same stuff plus a few more desirable ingredients I ordered it instead of my third can of craze.  I am trying to find something with the focus of craze but a bit more pump and thermogenic effect.  My initial impressions are not great and the taste is just tolerable.  Perhaps I expect too much but the 'focus' effect is not the same and I didn't notice any significant physical effects, either.  I've only tried it once so I will try for another week or two and update again but for now, i'm not nearly as impressed as others seem to be.  Anyone have s****estions on a PWO that gives the focus of craze with pump and thermo, too????  Maybe it's time for craze version 2!!!\n",
      "Wow!  Love this stuff.  Great prework out drink.  Kept me focused, hyped up, and love the taste.  Mixes very well.\n",
      "Didn't work out for me, really wanted to like it but it kept on giving me a bad crash. Tried both one and two scoops. Couldn't do anything at the gym from all the headaches and nausea. Smell of the product is good, flavor is bad. No energy provided, it just drained me of energy.\n",
      "Great job on this product. Not big into pre-workouts these days because most are just bs and you don't really need them all the time--but this hands down is well worth the money. No crazy energy spikes,jitters,or a lot of that &quot;beta itch&quot;. Overall an excellent product and is top 5 of the better pre's on the market\n",
      "Hands down the best preworkout on the market right now. Incredible energy and focus coupled with pumps and muscle endurance. You simply can't find a better product. Highly recommend! Check out my review on the forum for a more detailed review.\n",
      "Try it for yourself! Really good product, and I have tried the best of the best. Ritual gave top of the line endurance, stamina extreme focus, mental clarity and amazing tunnel vision. Ingredients were very properly dosed and not to mention I wasn't over stimulated and zero crash!\n",
      "Tried both the peanut butter and the chocolate truffle, the peanut butter was worth it will most likely reorder it, however the chocolate truffle has this awful after taste almost like you are drinking rubbing alcohol i will not re order the chocolate truffle, i will try the raspberry flavor next. the texture on them is definitely satisfying not to chewy and not rock hard and very consistent. overall stands at a 7 just for the chocolate's after taste.\n",
      "Bought a few different bars, for work primarily. I did enjoy this, wasn't hard or gooey, nice texture. Lots of actual fiber a plus. No stomach issues at all.  Will try other flavors.\n",
      "I love this snack. High in fiber, protein and low in fat, sugar. Great! \n",
      "Best TASTING protein bar I've tasted in a LOOOOOOONG time! Easy to chew and NO horrible aftertaste like some protein bars.\n",
      "I LOVE these bars!! 20g of protein (my minimum requirement in a bar) PLUS 20g of fiber and ZERO sugar alcohols makes it a winner. They're dense and filling but without being chalky or feeling heavy on my stomach. Definitely will be keeping them on hand. \n",
      "Recently tried all 3 flavors and the chocolate chip cooke was my favorite. They are all really good and great to snack on for a quick intake of protein. Chewy consistency that is filling and appetizing. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Tastes So Good! as far a protein bars go they are like candy. I purchashed one box of the gourmet protein bars as a gift for my brother, luckily I ordered an additional bar for myself! They go down easy and you can enjoy the cheesecake taste without it lingering too long or without it overwhelming your tase buds in a bad way. My brother liked them as well, as it didnt take him a long time to open the box and finish a couple off. The amount of protein in one bar is ample for some, but given the good taste I think it could have more. But overall, with these bars I kept saying, More!\n",
      "They were ok if I needed something quick & nutrition was good but I found them to be quite bland tasting which left me feeling disappointed. \n",
      "ANSI is one of the only brands that manufactures an excellent low carb bar, high protein, great tasting low sodium bar. Way to go guy's you nailed it!! TY\n",
      "Well the old one was nice but you needed 2 scoops or more for some... the new one added more caffein and agmatine.. the taste wasnt as good as the old grape.. the pump wasnt bad but not quite what i thought it will be so i added glycerol for it... recovery as always is very good could go on and on it lasts all training and felt from the begining.. nice energy and the focus is fine but i had better... will probably take again in the future \n",
      "I did not experience a good pump from this product \n",
      "The last formula was good but lack of cafeine (70mg per scoop) and agmatine and need to up to two scoop. With the new formula, wow, 200mg of cafeine per scoop, 700mg agmatine where other put between 250-500mg. 1.5gr creatine,2.6g carnosine... Other good ingredients and the taste...oh my good! So good!! Disolve quickly, great energie, focus ,pump. Really like it, bb.com should change the sup fact because they dont show the new fac.\n",

      "This is my first bottle of Mito Charger. I have never used this supplement before but have enjoyed the AOR Ortho-Core vitamins and have taken them daily for a few years now. I decided to try the mito-charger knowing that AOR produced a good quality product. I can tell you I noticed an immediate increase in energy. I honestly feel great since taking this product. I have extensive experience with supplements and exercising and will be incorporating this supplement into my program from now on. It is really worth trying.\n",

      "Horrible product, the worst supplement you can ever waste your money on. I am through my second bottle and my hands are cranking more, the worst joint support product I ever took.\n",
      "Works better than any other joint support I have tried, more effective than just glucosamine and chondroitin.  Gets pricey for the people who weigh more, kind of a deluxe choice for the heavyset.\n",
      "Best joint supplement I've taken by far one of the few products ive came across that has cissus in it as well as the typical ingredients. I can definitely tell a difference in my joints and this is one of the few supplements that I continue to come back to every time. The one downfall is the price is a little high, but overall its a great product and I definitely recommend it! \n",
      "I take these occasionally, not in a set pattern, to help with my running. I have had issues with my shins in the past, but recently have been having issues with my ankles and knees. I think these may be helping, although it is hard to tell. But I haven't had any more injuries since I started taking them. I started taking them at the tail end of recovery from a shin/knee injury, in which I had to not run for 4 weeks (not fun), I think these helped.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my surgically repaired knee, I used to take CVS brand glucosamine/chondroitin + MSM. It reduced pain but after activity the knee would swell up and put me out of action for a few days. After about a month of taking Osteo-Sport(3 per day, I found better mobility during activity and little to no swelling the day after. I am very pleased with the results and will continue to take the supplement.\n",
      "I saw increases in strength across the board, for the month I took it.  No digestion issues, pairs well with my preworkout.  Very good price for what it delivers.\n",
      "It's the first time I bought a caffeine product. I picked up this caffeine for the low price. I've been including it in my own homemade pre-workout. It is what it is and it is a great value for the low price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using this supplement for a full year now and am about to purchase my third container. It gives great energy as expected from caffeine and you can't beat the price. It is somewhat hard to swallow and does taste pretty bad, but I don't buy supplements for their taste, I buy them for their effectiveness. That is why I'm giving this product a 10 out of 10, because it is very effective and cost efficient. If you need a caffeine supplement, I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Really chalky and I'm not a great pill taker but does the job.\n",
      "I really like this for a morning pick up or whenever I need extra energy. I've tried taking the capsule by itself, but like some of the other reviews state it does tend to be hard to swallow. Solution: I usually dissolve mine in a liter of water and add in a water flavoring. You're getting part of your water for the day and caffeine. Diluted in a liter (33oz) of water it comes out to 6mg/oz. You can play with the concentration depending on your caffeine tolerances.\n",
      "This product works as advertised. The reason for my low rating is that this pill is impossible to swallow without a good bit of it dissolving in your mouth. This in itself wouldn't be a problem but the bitter taste is just awful and I'm not very picky about bad tastes either. This in itself could be forgivable accept that I have taken other caffeine pills from bodybuilding and not had this problem. I can say though that if adding to a liquid it will dissolve very fast so this may be a good choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good product at a good price. i wish the pill was coated so i wouldn't get an after taste in my mouth but I've learned to swallow it quickly. i wouldn't pay more for an coated one so i will definitely be ordering again. \n",
      "Great product. You can also cut the pills to split dosages. Dissolves well in a homemade pre-workout mix I make. \n",
      "Great product and great price, will definitely be buying Applied Nutriceuticals products!\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm one of those people that hate skimming through reviews to find the ones who are not paid to review an item.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been taking this product since January. I combined this product with Quadralean as well for the same period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I literally feel no difference at all in taking these supplements. No energy boost, no curb in appetite, no dramatic weight loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I have been losing weight, it is at a natural progress because I changed my diet and started working out 3-4 times weekly. The supplements really haven't had any effect on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "Easy to take size capsules and was everything that was promised. While using this product I dropped those last nasty ten pounds that wouldn't go away with any other product!  Love it and have already purchased another bottle for my stock!  \n",
      "Fat Free-A fat burner that I am in love with\n",
      "Energy: 9.5/10-I almost feel like this might not be high enough a rating on this product. In order for me to rate it any higher for energy, it would have to be a bad thing though. I have been dosing 2 caps upon waking and one later in the day and for me this dosing was amazing. You dont get the crazy jitters or the massive crash like I have from other products.\n",
      "Weight Loss: 9.5/10-I started this product just over 6 weeks ago weighing in at 270.7lbs. This morning I hit the scales at 255.9. I didnt really change my eating habits while taking this product, I merely ate when hungry and trained like normal. A touch over 2lbs a week without adding in any cardio and changing diet much is a huge win in m\n",
      "I have just completed my first bottle of Free Test XRT.  I like the results so far!  I had more noticeable veins showing in my arms during my workouts (increased vascularity?)!  I had more energy and drive going into my workouts (first thing in the mornings).  I can tell that both my strength and size are changing with just the completion of my first bottle.  At 42 years of age, this product appears to be a good fit for me.  I stack this with GAT Jetmass for creatine and then with Pro-JYM Chocolate Cookie Crunch blended protein.\n",
      "I loved this product, this deliver fairly quick intense energy and really nice pumps, it also seemed to have some thermogenic properties, had me sweating my *** off, I also enjoyed that it doesn't last quite as long as uncut which makes it a better choice for evening lifters. If your unsure try out that drive rpm stack it's cheap and will give you an idea of the product, or ask any rep for samples. App nut makes some amazing pre's.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would go with another brand. I noticed zero with this product. Others do work however!\n",
      "WEAK dose of yohimbe. 2.5 mg, suggested once a day? This didn't do anything for me. This product does virtually nothing. For any effect you'll need to take 2-3 pills 2-3 times a day. Don't waste your money, get something worthwhile.\n",
      "I stacked this with Kris Gethins' caffeine pills and it worked fat loss wonders. Highly recommend!\n",

      "Does help with the last few stubborn spots in conjunction with fasted cardio. I use other brands they typically work the same as long as it's HCL and your taking the right amount to get the benefits. \n",

      "This is awesome to add some extra good fats to your diet. I use it as dressing on salads and it's a refreshing and satisfying addition!\n",
      "No fishy burps! Lemon taste is totally doable. I like to mix a teaspoonful with my plain yogurt and a small handful of kashi cereal. You get a light lemony flavor crunch :) \n",

      "i have defiantly noticed the difference when use this product, i just mix it with a sports drink and creatine and it works great and there is alot of servings and cheap, you can add more scoops for a better pump but only on occasion because your body will just get used to the higher amount, buy this if you are looking for a cheap pre workout or something to add to your existing pre and you will notice the difference   \n",
      "I've been using Beta-X now for a few months.  I can tell a difference when I forget to add it to my pre-workout AR-5.  Great supplement without jitters or making me feel tingly in my scalp.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This product is fantastic as long as you can get past the extremely sweet & stale flavor.\n",
      "I can feel the difference when taking this I'm able to last longer and have more energy during workouts.  AST is a brand you can trust and I like that it's not to sweet and can be added to anything and doesn't ruin the taste at all and the servings for the price are another plus.  Mixes very easily also doesn't clump on the bottom or settle to the bottom like other products I've tried.\n",
      "Great Product.\n",
      "This product is truly amazing. I just received it in the mail and have been using it first thing in the morning before I begin my weight training. I also use it before intense cardio and I feel more energetic and alert. I honest felt I can get to that last rep when lifting and thru my cardio with more energy. the result is I've been feeling terrific afterwards.

I'm glad to see it is still a high quality product, which made this purchase super solid! Recovery time and soreness are cut in half and in some cases almost non existent! I mix it with less then 8 ounces of apple juice before my workout, goes down smooth! and then add it to my protein shake post workout! \n",

      "This product delivers!!!  Before I was taking this Glutamine post-workout, my recovery was slower and I felt more.  Now I just added a scoop of this to my protein shake and recovery has picked up.  I will absolutely continue using this!!!\n",
      "This is the best protein out there. I use chocolate and vanilla every day with no side effects.  It has no fillers and the ingredient list is very short . It only contains what your body needs.  The absolute best protein out there!!\n",

      " If you are looking for gains, Glutamine is a must and you want quality. I highly recommend this supplement as part of your supplement regime. The most important times are when you wake up, before/post workout, and before bed. Make sure to do your own research on how much your body needs at these times.\n",
      "I have tried many Glutamine products and this one is in my honest opinion the best one I have ever taken. I can really tell the difference with this one the recover/soreness I usually would feel has been cut in half to almost no soreness at all with this product. I add this to my pre and post workout shakes and take another serving right before bed to help with not only recovery but upping my natural GH levels. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality product at a very good price!\n",
      "Being my first L-Glutamine supplement, I would say it does what it says it will. I take a serving right when I wake up and immediately after my workouts, it definitely reduces the pain from a hard workout and that means recovery is being sped up. Good product.\n",
      " The GL3 L-Glutamine is very good. I took it after my workout's and before bed. The next morning there was hardly any soreness. I've tried other glutamine products which work pretty well, but the GL3 L-Gutamine &amp;amp; the Cretaine I was very impress with. I could really tell the differance. I highly recommed them.\n",

      "I've tried a lot of different glutamine powders and capsules.  This one is my favorite!  I can definitely feel the difference in my lifts and in my recovery.  When I run out?  UGH  Someone please whack me upside the head for not ordering the BIGGER container. :) Lesson learned.\n",

I feel great, have more energy throughout the day, skin is smoother, and have not fallen ill since I first began using this product (consistently, 2x/day) a couple years ago. The negative feedback for this product center around the size and taste of the capsule, but I would choke one down twice the size if the results were as good as this! Come on...13 cents a capsule! What a bargain for a first choice multi!\n",
      "All four of us take this it is easy on the stomach and has all of daily vitamins. A great value for your money too. My son’s goals are weight gain and muscle building. My goals are weight loss and my husband is looking for energy and mood stability. It is great for everyone because it has so much to offer. Pills are big but you get used to it since you only have to take one or two a day.\n",

      "I've always taken a multi vitamin, but wanted to try something more geared toward athletes. I ordered the 100 tablets because I was not sure what the vitamins would do to my stomach. In the past, some multi vitamins have really torn my stomach up, especially on the first day. I'm pleased to say that I have had no adverse effects, even on the very first day. The tablets are a bit large and sometimes hard to swallow. I'll probably order the 200 count next time around.\n",

      "A wreck my body alot with the type of activities I do and with the schedule that I have. I have no sympathy for myself at the gym or in life, in regards to pain. No compaliners wanted. I just recently started taking a multi. because I realize if I want to continue being a beast. I need to counteract what aging and heredity already is doing. I am not a big fan of pill popping. So I started taking One a day for men. I didn't feel much of any difference so I researched a good multi because I figured I need a superman pill. I found AST Multi Pro 32X. As of right now, I feel a good pump throughout the day. My only concern is the Iron percentage this pill has.\n",
      "This stuff is great. I don't know if it's the extra B vitamins or what but I have an increased energy level without the caffeine jitters. Fast recovery after lifting and overall feeling good. My mom has fibromyalgia. She had pain and was lacking energy. I started her on these vitamins and something in them has made her aches and pains go away and increased her energy level. I have promoted these to family, friends, and fellow workers. I would certainly recommend you try them.\n",

      "Seriously , this beef protein is the best for me digestion is awesome no bloating or gas, really help give you strength before training and help you recuperate after . The taste is just amazing it's like a real Chocolate cake , the mixing is good too you just have to use you muscle a little more to get it mix , foaming is just like every other beef protein like muscle med or muscletech so it's ok you just let it stand for a 5 and it's perfect. This protein is now my only choice even more it a 3lbs Comare to others I just wish they start making 5 or 6 lbs\n",
      "I loved this stuff. Like most have stated it is a little stubborn to mix in a blender bottle and foams a little. I almost always use a blender anyway so not an issue for me. \n",
      "One of my favorite ways to take this is to blend up a few servings, portion into 1 cup containers and put them into the refrigerator. If left overnight they set up into a great tasting pudding. So easy to grab one or two post workout.\n",
      "Doesn't mix well by means of shaking. Had to use blender or single hand mixer to stop the chunk factor. When it was mixed well the taste was great.\n",
      "This protein is waterproof. If you like chewing your unmixable protein shake, this if for you.\n",
      "This is without a doubt my absolute favorite protein. I had never ventured to beef protein until I tried this one. Let me just say, best decision i've ever made in the supplement world. My stomach no longer is in knots from various wheys and milk proteins, the mixability is incredible, and the taste. Wow, the taste is out of this world. I LOVE the dark chocolate. It's so robust compared to most chocolate flavored proteins, and it never gets old. I will DEFINITELY be buying this again very soon. \n",
      "This is by far the best protein I've ever had. I've tried just about everything you can buy at the gym or local shop and on bodybuilding.com as far as brands of protein. This is very good tasting and doesn't leave you with a funky aftertaste. I'm not as sore the next day as I used to be so clearly my body is absorbing and using more of the proteins in Raptor than all the other proteins I've had. \n",

      "Without a doubt the best tasting and most effective protein I've ever used. It legit tastes like brownies and has helped me add several pounds of muscle. The only drawback is that it's easily the worst in terms of mixing. The powder gets very clumpy and does not blend well in a blender bottle and when trying to stir into yogurt or oatmeal it often makes a big mess.\n",

It usually takes a week or so to start seeing any effects, but near the end of a 8-12 week run I can notice a significant difference. There is no big dropoff or loss of mass when I go off of it, but I do notice it harder to make gains while I am not using it. Maintaining lower bodyfat is also more difficult when I cycle off of it. \n",

      "This is an update from my previous review.\n",
      "I was fortunate to receive and use the updated version (2014/2015 pre-repackaging) of AEN's APE and I am exceptionally impressed with the results! While over the history of my use of this product (+/- three years to date), I did experience some varied results from a few, perhaps out date batches, I must say overall changes in my physique from using APE have been nothing but phenomenal. APE most certainly delivers in all areas of testosterone elevation, lean muscle acquisition, fat loss and overall strength and recovery. I would recommend stacking this product with an equally exceptional nitric oxide product (like AEN's Steel Edge) to experience maximum muscle pumps!\n",
      "\n",
      "I just finished my first bottle and I rate APE as my favorite Test booster thus far. I've tried most of the brands out there and honestly the only ones that ever worked for me were P6 Extreme and now Ape. Ape to me seems to work a little better than P6 and at a much cheaper price. The reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because Test Boosters in general really don't jack up your Test levels all that much. It's almost not worth it to buy one. Now I'm not sure if it helps my gains or not but it does do a decent job with my labido and with giving me that Alpha Male feel. For the price and the results APE is the product for me!\n",
      "really great product. On my 3rd bottle now. Great price here. all 3 bottles I've purchased have given me phenomenal results, I am really impressed with this test booster and I will be purchasing it again and recommending to my buddies.\n",

      "I have used APE a few times. If used properly it is incredible. I follow the instructions on the box and I have gotten awesome results. For example I went from incline benching 70lb dumbells for apporx. 6 reps (3rd set) to benching 80lb dumbells for 8-10 (3rd set) and 90's flat after about week 4 the strength really started coming. I am at approx. 163lbs bodyweight. Try an 8-week run of APE, you will not regret it.\n",

      "I don't know how well it works as a test booster but if you want to drive your appetite through the roof then start taking these. I was starving all the time.\n",
      "I tried this product for 2 months and got all the results I wanted from it. I kept strength and I lost weight. Vascularity was very noticeable I was having veins pop out left and right and I still have a lot of body weight to drop. Libido kicked in around week 3 and I was definitely having me in the mood more often. My mood was a lot more calm and when I hit the weights I had that alpha mindset and pushed weights I felt I couldn't before, even crushing old prs. My strength/endurance has definitely improved weights I had trouble with in the past  I do in reps with strict/controlled form. Rest periods between sets have been lowered from 45 sec to 30sec and my HIIT sessions are more intense and I gas out a lot later.For the price give it a try\n",

      "1st time using a testosterone booster and this has greatly increased my recovery. I'm making gains like a beginner while using APE. I'm going to get another month supply.\n",
      "This stuff is amazing, plain and simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've found this to be quite effective. I was picked to log some earlier in the year, February I think, and I am just now finishing up a 12 week run. I would never by a 12 week supply of a product like this if I didn't think it worked. While using this, I get very good pumps, great workouts and increased strength. One thing I've noticed is if I'm not eating enough to bulk, I still get stronger even if I'm losing weight. I think this product is perfect for people trying to get ripped up and stay strong. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "This was my second TB iI have tried. The first one was from MusclePharm (battle fuel). That one was ok. the reason I tried Ape was the reviews were great and a lot of people said the side effects are small or none at all. I used it for 8 weeks. The first 4 weeks I saw great results dropped 2% body fat and started looking bigger and much stronger. What confused me was that on the 2nd month I didnt notice much of a difference. I would even say my energy levels dropped and strength started to go down. Diet was the same work outs were the same. Not sure what I did wrong. Maybe I got burned out. Didnt have a rest week in a long time. Will try again and give a review on it.\n",
      "Great product!\n",
      "I have been using this product for 4 weeks and have noticed increase in strength and endurance in the gym. I am excited to see what the next 4 weeks will turn out. \n",
      "\n",
      "This product is just awesome. I've tried other test boosters, never noticed any change. On APE, I noticed the effects within the first week. I had a better attitude in the gym, felt stronger, and had more energy. Even on tough volume days, I felt just as strong on the last set as I did on the first set. Over 8 weeks, I blasted through plateaus and set a 25 lb 5RM PR on squats and a 15 lb 5RM PR on bench. AEN delivered another solid product here, I'll definitely be buying some more.\n",
      "This is truly an awesome product. My first testosterone booster. The product advertisement is spot on.Finished a 12-week cycle, took a month off, and am ready for more.\n",
      "This is the third testosterone enhancer I have tried and it is by far the best. This product does have side affects that affected my mood at times however, the results in the gym from taking this product were very noticable after about a week of taking the product. I am about to start my second cycle of APE. I recommend having an estrogen blocker on hand for when you cycle off this product. \n",
      "I've completed 3 cycles of APE so far and I have to say, absolute best test booster I've encountered. My energy shoots through the roof, my pumps are insane, and the fat burn is amazing. I just ordered for my next cycle and definetly recommend that everyone try it as well! If you want a bigger kick out of your cycle, I recommend hitting 2 doses a day for a full 12-week cycle, you won't regret it!\n",
      "This product has a really good profile in it for solid natural testosterone level enhancing.  I felt like my recovery time was much fast when taking this, and my lifts went up by about 10-15% and remained higher after my cycle was complete.  I also found my libido to be a little higher than normal from the Maca Extract which was a nice bonus.  I would definitely use this again when I can get it on sale, or hopefully a Buy2 Get 1 deal.  The only reason I gave this a 9 instead of 10 is due to the value factor; this costs over $40 but the amount of servings is lower than competing testosterone enhancing products and therefore the dosage you are getting is also a little lower.  But in saying that, the ingredients in APE must be of very high quality since I did notice positive results on the lower than normal dosage.  Definitely give this a shot if you want an extra edge.\n",
      "Great product. Had great drive with this product. Body went up 4lbs in a 30 day cycle. Lean as well. Number's went up across the board. Would recommend this product to others needing a extra boost in the weight room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantastic product. Easily one of my favorite natty test boosters around. Libido and mood were great which is a serious highlight of this product. Explosive strength improved significantly, and I was pumped around the clock. This is ny go to PCT product!\n",
      "Nothing but hype. Does not do anything besides waste your money.\n",
      "Aside from the money i spent, I really wanted to like this. I am just finishing my second bottle and I haven't had any strength or size increase. No better or worse than the other test products I have tried here. A slight libido increase but I would not buy it for that, there are better options, like creatine. I wont be buying this again.\n",
      "Honestly I dont know what these other people are talking about. I ran a 3 month cycle, the 1st 2 months I took 2 pills and the 3rd I took 3 pills. Absolutely nothing, nada, ziltch! After researching their facebook page it is clear they buy the 10/10 reviews by enticing people with free Supps! APE is a waste of cash and anyone that has a so called blog on it claiming it is the greatest thing (40 bucks mind you) is suspect!\n",
      "I did not feel or notice any gains after completing one month on this. I did not notice libido, increased recovery or any other of the claims. I am cutting while using this so perhaps that could attribute but all in all, did not work for me.\n",
      "like everyone else i read all the logs and reviews on this and decided to give it a try, on my fourth week, i've tried other testosterone boosting supplements that did nothing for me, this one however obviously made a difference, took it right after a cut going onto a bulk, helped a lot with getting the gains going.and helped with the terrible DOMS, currently favorite test booster, gonna go ahead and order another bottle and run 8 weeks, if that goes well i may do the max 12 weeks\n",
      "Everyone with a ***** should at least give this a try. This product is the real deal, no bull****. Enough said.\n",
      "This product is awesome.  Easier effort in the gym, increased attitude out.  \n",
      "Wow is all I can say about this product after being on USPLabs Prime which is now discontinued.  I was looking for natural test booster as it always helped with my workout aside from using PWO's and other natural supplements.  The problem I saw with most PWO's including Craze and Jack3d is that by mid day I started feel tired.  I'm turning 34 tomorrow and just with one dosage alone an hour before the workout this morning my mental focus and the energy level have dramatically increased.  It's not so much that huge boost but I felt as though I could've stayed in the gym another 30 minutes pounding weights (except I had to go to work).  I'll do the 12-week cycle and see how it works!  So far so good!\n",
      " I've been looking for a natural test booster since I seem to have some of the signs were a tb is reccommended. If I can benefit from them, this isn't the one...and it cost more than most tb's too! btw\n",
      "A friend recommended this to me so I tried it. I took it for 12 weeks and lost 28 pounds, dropped 7% in BF and increased my PR on the bench, deadlift, military press and squats! The pumps were amazing and the vascularity was through the roof! Definitely worth the $40 I spent on the bottle! I would have spent alot more for a personal trainer and probably not had near the results!\n",
      "I've never used a test booster or anything of this nature so reading all the reviews on here made me want to try it. Went out and snagged a bottle up. The next day took it after I ate breakfast waited 90 minutes before I hit the gym and right away I got an insane pump. I've had the best workouts by far these last 3 weeks than I ever had before, I get a tunnel vision when I'm in the gym and didn't want to leave! I've always been vascular but APE makes them definitely pop out like they are going to explode out of my skin. I also noticed that I stayed vascular like this for the rest of the day and had the full feeling effect, which is my favorite part! Strength has obviously went up from getting back on a bulk, but each week I'm averaging about a 5 pound increase on most of my lifts. I'm sure I will definitely hit a plateau with the increase but so far just keeps going up!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried a few of the APE products and was hopeful for this one. Unfortunately, I had use a directed for the full month and felt no affect or change. Definitely not worth the money. Of course some people react differently to products, but for me, it did nothing. \n",
      "Waste of Money. Didn't notice any changes or improvement.\n",
      "Before anyone thinks of me being biased in this, notice I bought all 3 tubs on Black Friday. This PWO was being compared from my experience of Pre Jym, Scream, White Flood. I feel Steel Edge is neck to neck with Scream, one of my all time favorites. Definitely better than Pre Jym in terms of price and just as good if not better focus. The profile is pretty good and you can see they don't cheat you with a serving size being 20 g. Flavor was pretty good with a hint of chalky taste like most PWO, but Fruit Punch was my favorite. Great sweet/fruity taste for you sweet PWO lovers, and loved it with cold water, tasted like a Margarita . This PWO is one of my staples because it seems to hit all the key details I look for in a PWO very well (Focus, Performace, Pump and Energy), but hit Focus the best in my opinion. Energy was never a problem with this PWO due to the sustained release caffeine (50 mg), so my energy levels were still going great after workouts in the morning. Never tried a PWO with Ashwagandha til this, but I am a fan now. Pump was still good on this PWO and had good vascularity, but focus was my favorite part of this PWO. Hoping for more flavors to be released as I will be trying this Pre again .\n",
      "Big fan of this preworkout and this company.  I remember taking their standalone beta alanine before a workout and their intra product while working out around 5-6 years ago.  I'm glad they're getting the recognition they deserve!\n",
      "\n",
      "Steel Edge provides a lot of energy, but it doesn't make you feel jittery.  It seemed like a nice, sustained energy after sipping for about 15 minutes.  Vascularity, pumps, and endurance were were all greatly improved.  I went through 2 tubs back-to-back, and during which I discovered I definitely like the Fruit Punch more than the Strawberry Margarita.  I'm not a fruit punch flavored fan, either.  Strawberry Margarita wasn't bad imo, but it had an aftertaste that made it not as pleasant as Fruit Punch.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely in my top 5 preworkouts I've used.  Highly suggest to anyone looking for plenty of energy from only a 1-scoop product!\n",
      "Flavor is pretty good even though its a bit chalky from the ingredients. Clean sustained energy with solid pumps and focus. Can't ask for anything more. Definitely one of the better pre-workouts on the market and would buy again. Highly recommended giving this a shot. \n",
      "I have used this product the past 2 months, it gave me the focus I needed and energy. The taste was pretty good also. I am not reordering again I like to change my pre workouts every 2-3 months. \n",
      "Amazing product I am glad I tried something new tastes great and provides consistent energy and fuel\n",
      "Took this at 7:00 am this morning, haven't looked back since. This is the best pre-workout i have bought in years. I'm still going, my body went into the beta-alanine rush and had an awesome workout, it's almost 4pm and i still going - wide awake, full of energy. Can't say more than this, been taking this daily since purchasing, haven't crashed once this far. I will buy the margarita flavor once I'm done with this very generous tub of goodness! \n",
      "Steel Edge has been the best pre workout that I have used. The fruit punch flavor is above and beyond the competitions fruit punch. It offers a nice clean energy, I don't feel jittery and it keeps my going through my 1.5 hour workouts at 5 am.\n",
      "One of the more legit Pre's on the market and about as close to a 10/10 as you can get. Rivals old school DMAA pre's with the focus and the sustained energy is top tier. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and found that you get an initial spike of energy and it lasts a LONG time, more than enough for 1-2 hr workouts. The focus is on par with how DMAA supps were and really might even be better. Open label is the reason this gets the full rating as you cant argue that you dont get what you pay for here. As for the flavoring system, not a fan of anything Fruit Punch but this is really flavored well, like Fruit Punch Sweet Tarts. Strawberry Margarita is the best Pre I have tasted in 10 years, they really hit the nail on the head with that Flavor. \n",
      "Instantaneous & sustained energy throughout my 1.5 hour work out. Flavoring system was great, and mimicked a genuine strawberry margarita. Would buy again & again. Thanks AE. \n",

The Ethyl Ester pills came and mine were NOT stuck together as I read in other reviews.  So far no bloating after about 2 weeks.  I am not sure if it has the same effect as the Micronized Mono.  I will finish the bottle.  Depending on how I feel at the end, I will decide if I will purchase this again or suffer with the stomach bloat.  \n",
      "Noticeable gains in strength over a short period of time.\n",
      "Just received all tablets stuck together lost maybe 5 or 6 tablets splitting them up poor show!!\n",
      "The first bottle arrived with the capsules a solid, gross mass of goo. Bodybuilding.com sent a replacement (though I asked for anything else) and it was exactly the same. Each capsule was wrinkled and mushy. I even sent in a video to Bodybuilding.com but they ignored it. This is the worst I've ever had from this site. \n",

No difference what so ever with my strenght, endurance, muscle volume, tonus etc. Tried it for 2 weeks and I got back to good old micronized creatine (monohydrate from Optimum Nutrition). Now THAT's a product that always delivers :)  I'll give it a 1 because even if the price is very low, it was still a waste of money for me :(\n",
      "This is a great product. I just finished my first bottle and my bench press and squat both went up by 25 lbs. I experienced only minor bloating when i reached the last few capsules(thats why i rated it a 9 instead of a 10).\n",
      "Dont like it. No gains, no results. Took mono, it worked great. Finished then went to this.... Nothing. Back to mono I go.\n",
      "Started this product a month ago and immediately noticed less bloating compared to straight Mono Creatine. Also realized my energy levels during workouts were elevated. I did not think much about it the first few workouts, just thinking I am having a good day...but after 3 and 4 workouts and then more I noticed my workout were full of energy and stamina I did not have before. I clued in and realized that it was this product. I am 215 lbs and take 3-4 capsules before the workout and 1 capsule after the workout. I do not take it on my days off. The energy levels are great....I agree with some other posts...have to back off sometimes...Looking forward to putting on some size but keeping the waist...We will see over the next few months how this product helps.\n",
      "This is the first time I have tried creatine. After doing some research ethyl ester seemed to be the best way to go. It took about 2 weeks before I saw any results, but when I did, I managed to set several new personal bests in my lifting. This should be a must have in anyones suppliment regiment. I give it a 9 just because I have nothing else to compare it to.\n",
      "CEE is a great alternative to mono and you can't beat the price of this product. It has great quality.\n",

I was surprised it tasted really great especially with Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk. They really hit the nail on the head for this one! \n",
      "Overall nutritional profile is pretty solid, but the taste just isn't there. This stuff has a strong artificial sweetener taste that I just can't stomach. I will choke down the remainder of the 2 lb. (bought on sale at great price) as not to waste it, but I will not be purchasing again. Doesn't mix very well either. Not very impressed.\n",
      "Only thing this protein has going for it is the authentic french toast taste. Its no joke. Protein itself is mediocre at best. But yes if you want to taste buttery french toast buy it to try it. Not for athletes!\n",
      "I used to love this flavor and brand of protein powder!  However, they took it off the market for awhile for some reason.  I assume it was to re-brand or re-formulate the product.  I was thrilled when I found it on the site for sale again.  It's not bad tasting, but it definitely not how it used to taste.  I really like the fact that it's low-sodium and aspartame free.  The flavor is not bad as I've had some that were undrinkable but not as good as it once was.  Perhaps I'll try one of the other flavors.  \n",
      "WOW !!!\n",
      "Awesome stuff, this protein powder is amazing !\n",
      "First of all the taste of it is awesome, I chose the most unique one which is French Toast Flavor and at first I was very hesist to try it because there not many flavors like this for a Protein Powder but **** Axis Labs you definitely nailed this flavor, it taste exactly like a French Toast, you actually can feel the egg flavor added to the batter of a French Toast !\n",
      "Flavor is also pretty strong but not overly strong and held great with about 180-200ml of water, it's also sweet but not overly sweet I usualy add 1 packet of stevia to it as a shake but still I'll give it 10/10 for Flavor. if you like unique flavors and tired of the old Vanilla, Chocolate or Cookies & Cream flavors so this one is just for you !\n",
      "Now for the texture, I usually drink my protein powder with water and it came out with a nice milkshake consistency with about 180-200 ml of water without any clumps or residue at the bottom of the shaker so I'll give it 10/10 for texture/mixability.\n",
      "Now for the Ingridients/Macros well well Axis Labs you did a pretty good job here too with this one.  24g protein per scoop which is about 75g protein per 100g of powder which is very acceptable for it's current price at the store and also only 3g of carbs  which only 2g of them is sugar so it's absolutly a lean Protein Powder that I really reccomend to everyone, I'm actually pre-contest and use this protein powder for about 3 weeks and seen only good progress with it, I will sure buy it again but first I gotta try the S'mores flavor I'm sure it will be awesome !! :D\n",
      "This is my go to pre-workout! I bought it once just to try it out because of the reviews and simple ingredients and now it's my favorite. It gives me energy to power through cardio and strength training, it tastes great and it doesn't have any artificial flavors which makes it clear when mixed with water. I've tried other pre workouts/BCAA mixes and they made my stomach upset but this one doesn't, it's great!\n",
      "Got this on a buy 1 get 1, so have gone through 2 containers.\n",
      "It did give me energy, but had a lot of negatives, so wouldn't use again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "Energy\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons\n",
      "Poor mixing, crystals are like having sand in your drink.\n",
      "Bad taste, started mixing in a shot class with a chaser just to get it down.\n",
      "Itching, not the best quity supplements, gives you some flush and itching.\n",
      "everybody is different but for me this has been one of the best pw i ever used in last 6 years, it takes 20 mins to kick in and 1 scoop does its job well for me being 200 lbs with 9% body fat and hour of lift and hour of cardio, another good thing is that it doesnt crash like  most of them do, love the joint support feature which does actually work since i had it so i dont have to take joint support taking this pw, u have to compromise with the taste and mixability is poor, but gulp that whole thing no matter how u do it and it will do its job, great strength, pumps, focus, would recommend it to anyone, i will only rate it 9 for the taste and mixablity drawback else its 10/10\n",
      "i did not like it cause it did not mix well and it did not taste very good i did not really feel anything using this \n",
      "Gave this product a try and I find the single serving alright.  But Once I did a double before my competition at my local CrossFit box's Summer Throwdown.  I was amazed by the pumps and focus flowing through my body.  I was in-tune when my partner and I battled through our final event 500M Row, 20rep Deadlifts @ 115/135 lbs, C2B (pull-up) max then tag partner in......all with-in 3 minutes (2 rounds each)  second round was tough but pulled through.  Great Product that I will be using as my pre-workout, Thanks Axis Labs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I get a decent pump from the product and it doesn't taste half bad. It doesn't mix at all and the, \"power pellets\" stick all over my shaker. I have to rinse it out 5 times to get all the white grainy pellets out to mix my protein shake after.  If it mixed well would be a pretty good product for the price. \n",
      "When Bodybuilding.com stopped carrying Xtreme Shock for Canada, I had to find another pre-workout. I found SMA5H and decided to give it a tray. The pumps are really great, and I really like the fact it contains glucosamine to support the joints. It also has the usual pre-workout ingredients (beta-alanine, caffeine, creatine, etc.), as well as glycerol monostearate, which contributes to the pumps.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the watermelon flavor, and I don't taste the watermelon. AT ALL. The flavor is not bad, but if I had to describe it, I would say \"chemical honey\". It's sweet, like honey, but it has a chemical taste that is not bad, but definitely a surprise. So you might want to skip on the watermelon flavor if you are a watermelon fan like I am. Also, there are small beads in the powder that will not dissolve. The supplement is made like that, it's not a flaw, and they don't really bother me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, to summarize, it's a very effective supplement that doesn't taste super good (at least for watermelon flavor, since I don't know about other flavors). I would definitely recommend it. \n",
      "Excellent produit de A à Z...\n",
      "\n",
      "Good focus, Amazing Energy, Skin tearing... Very Great its 45 portion but i use 15gr so  30 day of explosive workout... Very good price for 30 BIG days\n",
      "\n",
      "VERY RECOMMENDED\n",
      "Great Pre workout. Good flavor. Wakes me up. Take 1 scoop and 10-15 minutes I feel awake and ready to go.  Usually hit the gym in the morning and I take this first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Nice formula.  Keeps me focused in the gym.  \n",
      "Pretty good pre-workout. It was cheap so I thought I would give it a try. The taste is fantastic! Focus and energy bust are good, but nothing outstanding. I haven't really noticed any difference in pump when on it, but I have been taking it during a cut so that might be part of it. The one drawback from Sma5sh (besides its name) are the \"pump pellets\" are kinda hard to put down. If you don't mix it well enough while drinking, it can be like drinking water+sand.\n",
      "Giving it an 8. not bad. taken allot of Pre-work out over the years and it would rank in the top 8. taste is good and the little pellets don't dissolve but taste good. I have only taken the recommended amount so it might be better at a scoop and 1/2. \n",
      "\n",
      "C4 is still the go too for energy without felling like you are on meth:)\n",
      "This is a decent pre-workout.  It gets me in the zone with great energy and intense focus.  I take it 4 times a week in conjunction with Axis Labs' Hemodraulix on my major lift days (chest, arms, legs, and Saturday all-around workout days).  Awesome is all I can say!\n",
      "Overall great Pre. Good dosages. Great consistency each and every workout. Pump is good.  taste isn't amazing but its good. you can feel the pellets when you drink it but its not a big deal. its not about the taste, its how well it works and it works well. \n",
      "i got big expectation on this product but i'm really disapointed. the mixability is realy bad and i dont get a kick when i use it, i try 1 scoop and 1 1/2. i will probably take 2 scoop next time, \n",
      "The ingredient profile look realy solid and is for this reason i give a 4/10.  the taste is realy awesome i realy like it, but i'm looking fot a pwo not kolaid,, i will stick with Hyper FX or No Explode. \n",
      "I was optimistic when I ordered this product.  At first, I enjoyed the idea of the \"pump pellets\" but after a while they get stuck in your teeth and blender bottle.  Tastes pretty awful.  I wouldn't recommend for weight-lifting.\n",
      "I had the Glacier Punch, Tasted amazing! Stayed focused throughout the workout, kept me going longer than usual. The only downfall was mixing, I literally would take a sip and my mouth would be full of grit. I just chomped them down and carried on but it was definitely different from other pre-workouts I've used. \n",
      "I have just finished finished the full box. Always used one scoop per serving, did not increase my dose so effectiveness took a slight dip towards the end due to the body getting used to the formula. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway the product is good, and provides good, clean energy, pumps are not mind blowing though. But then again i was taking a single scoop serving throughout. There is a slight crash afterwards, but nothing to too heavy. Mixes well (aside from the pallets) and taste is very drinkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a great product, no bloating and lasted through a long workout.\n",
      "I got watermelon. This is a great product except it's really great to get used to/immune to its effect. I'm not a huge fact of the insoluble granular beefs known as pellets but they work pretty well and give you energy wthout a crash. I eventually started double scooping and enjoyed the result from that. Overalls great product just texture sucks ad you need to rotate it or vary your preworkouts\n",
      "It works ok. I don't know if I'm just wanting my Craze back or what but didn't really get hyped up on this stuff. I will note that I did the recommended dosage to start which had little effect so I double dosed. Big mistake! I was seeing stars and my workout was cut short.\n",
      "I'm about half way through my first (an apparently last) container of SMA5H and it definitely does what I need.  It picks me up very quickly, even after a long day of work, and gives me a great pump going into the gym.  I will say, that I didn't like the granular feeling the drink hard because it didn't mix very well.  The product itself talks about \"beads\" which I found somewhat annoying/gross to drink through.  I'd rather have a pre-workout that mixes better.\n",
      "Very palatable flavour, and noticeable increase in initial energy.  A little weak as far as stims go, but stacked with a glass of green tea 1 hour prior, it puts me in a great workout zone.  My pumps weren't noticeably affected, obviously the more carbohydrates I had in my system before my workout the better my pumps were, but with 45 servings for a great price, this is an excellent pre for those who want a little bit lighter of a boost.  \n",
      "There were not many reviews on this product, but it got stellar reviews and so in my continued search for a great pre-workout I decided to give it a try. The description really stresses the words 'pump pellets' and my Lord, they are a real thing. You know that because there are pellets in there that do not dissolve in water. So you kind of have these weird pellet-like floaters in your drink, You also get a lot of residue. \n",
      "Now, I have tried a few different preworkouts ( NO Xplod, Craze, etc..) and I had come to recognize and expect that tingling feeling you start to feel in your hands and fingertips when it starts kicking in. This product delivers no such feeling. It is kind of difficult to tell when it kicks in at all.\n",
      "Awesome preworkout good clean energy very level the whole time not to crazy off the wall. The pump comes on pretty late though, which i dont mind.\n",
      "This supplement does not mix with water and has floating white particles in it.  Tastes nasty and leaves crud in the glass.  I do not recommend sma5hed. \n",
      "This stuff really works!  \n",
      "Very good!\n",
      "Great dry effect..good price, overall label\n",
      "Good for quick water loss, solid product\n",
      "I'm giving this product a 6 because i don't know how much of a difference it made. I took it as directed for 3 days before a show and also was cutting water. Going to extend my use to probably 5 days next show and see from there. \n",
      "Product works great with no cramping or digestive changes.\n",
      "This stuff definitely does what it says. Been taking it for about a week now and without getting too graphic, everything is literally running right through me. My results have been noticeable to an extent, but I honestly feel to get the most out of this product you should be @ or under 10% bodyfat. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only downside is the number of caps you have to take. 8 per day can be a lot, especially if your taking other supps but once you get over that, you have a solid product for sure!!\n",
      "The product worked as it said.  I was almost scared at one point because I dropped around 6 lbs of additional water weight in about 3 days pre-competition.  \n",
      "Was trying that twice, not worked for me at all\n",
      "I used this product right before my last vacation to get that ripped looked while on the beach.  I have a tendency when taking a diuretics of getting bad muscles cramps.  This not only helped me achieve the tight 8 pack I was looking for but also no cramping even during workouts.  I just bought it again for my next trip coming up.\n",
      "I agree. These pills did absolutely nothing for me. Better off looking elsewhere for a water shed.\n",
      "I just used this product leading up to a photo-shoot for a contest submission. I was already in great shape having dieted for 6 weeks prior. The Xtract did exactly as I was hoping. I used it as directed on the package, without changing my carbs or sodium, I just cut water in 1/2 to 4L then in 1/2 again to 2L in the last days before my shoot. It definitely helped bring out my best possible physique that day. The best part though was afterward. I didn't experience any bloat whatsoever from rehydrating post. Excellent product, I will use again! \n",
      "I was randomly going through current promo and sale items and stumbled upon Xtract. I read the details about it, followed by the reviews, and was instantly sold on it by all the raving reviews so I decided to try it for myself. I received the product with a week and used it exactly how the directions tell you. I was AMAZED by the results, it more than just lived up to the reviews. By noon of my first day, I already felt like I shed all that unnecessary water weight and found that not only my feel but my look was improved 100%. My body looked and felt tighter and muscles hard. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to shed off that water weight in just a few hours to a day. I know that I will continue to order Xtract HD by Axis Labs.\n",
      "This was the first time I have ever used a diuretic before preparing for my first NPC physique competition read the reviews saw the rating so I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed with my purchase it worked ever better than what the label indicated and it will always be my product of choice when its time to shed excess water weight to come in dry and shredded. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to gain the edge that makes the difference between first and second!\n",
      "taking three at once and no resuslts\n",
      "I lost 3 pounds of water. Very good!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not bad, not outstanding,  just an average granolla bar item\n",
      "\n",
      "This bar was really tasty! Very chocolatey with a nice texture. I didn't like that there was only 13 grams of protein though, so for that reason I probably won't repurchase. I'd still suggest you try em out though!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this kind of bars about a month ago and they are good. The flavor is good and the ingredients okay. They have 17 g of Sugar maybe a little too much for my preference. I like them a lot better when I eat them cold straight out of the fridge.\n",
      "I will probably buy them again in the future if they are on sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great supplement. This is truly a great addition to any protein shake where you need extra fiber. I have never tried it by itself. Only tried it with protein powder. I accidentally mixed a shake up once then drove to work before trying to drink it. Needless, to say, I was unable to drink it because it had taken the consistency of grainy pudding. As long as you drink it within a few minutes, this product is great! 11 grams of fiber, and 7 grams of protein per scoop!\n",
      "This product is truly a life saver for me and it definitely delivers on everything is says. I love it!\n",
      "On the one hand, yes it gave me energy and kept me going, especially since my days start at 4:45AM and go to at least 10PM between work, school, gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, this gave me horrible, blinding, tear inducing migraines if I took it for more than two days in a row.  Those migraines where you're curled up in a tiny little ball with a mask on, vomiting and even thinking just hurts.  My reaction to this has kind of scared me from trying any other of this company's products, truth be told.\n",
      "This is the first review I have ever given on a website. I love this product. It gives me so much energy but doesn't make me feel jittery like a pre-workout. At the moment I only take one during breakfast and then one during lunch time. I don't every feel sleepy and I love that. Give it a try. It'll be worth it. \n",
      "I have nothing but great things to say about 2Shredded and Beast Sports Nutrition supplements in general! This product is a top-notch thermogenic on the market, yet it doesn't make you sweat in your chair while at work! This product successfully suppresses your appetite without even realizing it. I suggest this product to all of my friends, family, and people that ask me for a good fat burner! Keep making great products BEAST!\n",
      "great stuff !!\n",
      "I've been taking this product for 2 weeks and I've notice that it really does kill your appetite and i've lost 2lbs without really changing the way how i eat I'm eating less cause of this product, and its a great price. i rated it a 9 like they say theres always room for improvment\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste and effectiveness are separate things. The product deserves an 8 rating for sure. The recommended dosage in the recommended amount of water was a tad bit on the sweet side for me. I honestly hate sugar and things that taste like it. I've had worse flavours and it got the job done. \n",
      "They gave me a 30 servings product that will expire in few days.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a fantastic amino acid product! Good profile and great taste...can't go wrong with this product \n",
      "Got these items for free when I purchased Beast's pre-workout both aminolytes and their pre-workout are not very good. I had 2 scoops of the pre-workout and nearly got sick haven't had it since. And when it comes to their aminolytes its too sweet for me and doesn't taste like the flavor I was expecting. Would not recommend these products to anyone.\n",
      "Heavy recovery product containing 5gs of BCAAs and 5gs of other aminos.  Plus on top of aminos it contains an electrolyte blend for help the recovery process even more.  Overally great product.\n",
      "Blue raspberry is delicious! Pineapple is good as well, I'm not a huge pineapple fan either. \n",
      "Does not mix well at all. I always have left over residue at bottom of shaker. Taste isn't great either compared to other amino products I've tried. I would look somewhere else for a good quality amino supplement product.\n",
      "very tasty and one scoop holds up to my 32 ounce bottle. just started using it today so I can't say if it is supporting recovery yet, but i'll be back after i can review that part. \n",
      "i have not tried the other flavors yet but the pineapple was awesome. I mixed one scoop with a handful of ice and 16 oz of water. Sweet enough without being unbearable. I will try the other flavors next time i order.\n",
      "I absolutely love this stuff. All the flavors are delicious and I sip it all workout long and finish with a killer pump in conjunction with my pre. Recovery is solid also. I used to get cramps all the time, but the added electrolytes were the reason for my initial purchase, and cramps no more! I push harder and longer. Will be rebuying for years to come. \n",
      "The punch was fine.  The pineapple, imo, is hideous.  It's way to sweet.  It's actually unbearable. Unfortunately, it's so bad I'm not even going to use the rest of the bottle, and I've probably only consumed 4 servings of it. (And I'm a huge cheapskate with everything in my life)  I'm going to try a different brand ( Scivation XTEND ) as it gets lots of positive reviews on here.  (My overall rating was based on splitting the difference between the 9 I gave the punch and the 1 I gave Pineapple) \n",
      "Very weak supplement for me. \n",
      "Flavor: taste itself is good but extremely sweet. Even when dissolved in double amount of water, just too sweet. This makes it impossible to drink intra-workout because leaves you thirsty with a sweet taste in mouth.\n",
      "I initially bought it as a pre/intra drink for my cardio sessions but didn't felt any effect in endurance as stated on a bottle. Even simple BCAAs work better for me. The best use for it is a post-workout I think, but for this role there are much better and cheaper options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love these aminos! They are so refreshing, especially the watermelon flavor! \n",
      "Not a fan of the watermelon flavor, extremely sweet. Definitely not an 8.5. \n",
      "Kind of a hard review for me because I like the effects of the product and the taste at first is really good, but then it turns into a salty almost spicy taste which makes it hard to drink during workouts. I have to swig some water right after so it doesn't burn up my throat. I thought it was just me, but a friend of mine and my wife all said the same thing. So if you don't mind that salty taste it's a good product.\n",
      "Pineapple is on point! Best pineapple flavor ever. Watermelon tastes really good as well. However, it does have a spiced kick to it. Wasn't expecting it, but after a while you get used to it. Wakes you up in the morning if used as preworkout. (I don't take preworkout, so this spicy kick seem to wake me up at 6am).\n",
      "I've taken several other BCAAs, and Beast and MP have the best amino ratio and flavors for your $. Highly recommend it.\n",
      "Not a bad product overall but I found it really took a lot of shaking to get it to blend. Definitely helps with stamina intra-workout and since my trainer has me pretty much doing 100% fasted state workouts its definitely good to help keep from crashing midway through. Not bad, will try other products to see if they have any better results.\n",
      "After about 2 months of using the Aminolytes I can easily say they are me new favorite amino supplement. I can definitely  tell a difference from other BCAA's and it seems like a good quality product. I bought the Blue Raspberry and got the Pineapple and Watermelon for free - Blue Raspberry is (in my opinion) the best flavor of the three. The Watermelon flavor was a little strong but I just had to add a couple extra oz of water and that helped. Just ordered more Blue Raspberry and the Beast Punch so hopefully I like that flavor just as much!\n",
      "I absolutely love this flavor. This is my \"go to\" product for recovery. Great stuff!\n",
      "AMAZING!!!! never came across a pineapple flavor, usually any exotic fruit flavor tastes so artificial, but wow! tastes great! just like a real pineapple! loving it! should have gotten the bigger one!\n",
      "I purchased the trial size (5 servings) of the watermelon flavor. I hate to be a downer, but this stuff was disgusting! I took one sip and nearly spit it out. I managed to finish a few ounces before I finally couldn't take it anymore and dumped it. It burned my throat going down and the flavor was horrible! There was nothing watermelon-y about it. I didn't even give this trial size away. No one would take it, so I wound up throwing it out. What a waste of money! Pretty disappointing considering the reviews. This is just not my cup of tea.\n",
      "Ok..So I'm a verified buyer..sadly only less than 25%  (20 out of 123) are verified buyers.. I bought this simply because bodybuilding had a buy two get 1 free special..I was out of my aminolast..yea sure..y not? lets try a new brand!..wow was I wrong..I bought both flavors..the pineapple was disgusting..from its bootleg taste to the after taste to the very nasty scent it left in my shaker...What is this a Protein shake? I've never had that problem before w my bcaa drinks..The watermelon was overwhelming...very strong..add extra water if you use that flavor. Overall performance wise, it worked for me..I felt an extra boost and good recovery. Would I buy it again..no thank you..I would like something I enjoy drinking before, between,during and after my workouts.\n",
      "I have been looking for an added boost while working out and I tried this product. Started with the 5 servings first. The watermelon tastes excellent. I noticed more energy and stamina and focus at the gym. I am just finishing off my 30 servings of pineapple flavor. I don't think it is as good as the watermelon. I love the taste of pineapple but I think I will go back to watermelon. \n",
      "Both gave me the boost I needed. I also take Amphetalean by Beast throughout the day and while getting ready to head to the gym. Once I start to the gym and while I am there, I drink my Aminolytes. I feel like a BEAST! Awesome products!\n",
      "Excellent product in all aspects, except sucralose. It would be nice to find supplements  without it. I am among those who tolerate only small amounts.\n",
      "It causes diarrhea. Real sugar would be fine, or for those who don't want that Stevia would work very well. Sweet taste would be better too.\n",
      "I love this product, I got the watermelon flavour and I hate the taste of watermelon. However Beast's  watermelon tastes great and I love it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste 10/10\n",
      "As I don't even like watermelon but I love this so it's has to be a 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mix ability 9/10\n",
      "Froths up before shaking into something that looks like it's off a summer pond but after a quick shake it's all good to go, never seen it settle either so thumbs up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effect 10/10\n",
      "1 scoop before workout, 1 while woring out gives great endurance and I never feel sore.\n",
      "\n",
      "On 3rd tub now and will be buying again.\n",
      "This product, paired with the Pre-workout product, has helped to increase my productivity in high energy classes like Cardio Kickboxing! I am very thankful to Kay Jordt for recommending the products to me!! \n",
      "Great tasting and mixes really well with water.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very good product to be taken in the gym, let the body well hydrated and reduces fatigue. The taste is a bit sweet.\n",
      "Great product...i used it intraworkout or pre workout..gave mesustained energy levels and rapid recovery\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a different watermelon flavor than most watermelon supplements. It wasn't like a jolly rancher watermelon, which seems to be common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixed well and I didn't have to constantly keep shaking it.\n",
      "This product has been pretty useful to me lately since I ramped up my training regimen. I use one scoop intra workout to keep me moving and help repair my muscles while I tear away at those fibers. The taste is pretty good and the price is also reasonable. The only complaint I have is the powder is ultra fine so be cautious when trying to funnel it into a water bottle or dropping it into a shaker, expect a cloud of bcaas. Other than that I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for some fast recovery, decreased soreness after workouts and something to keep you going and replenish those electrolytes lost with high volume training.\n",
      "The product is good, but the taste is awfull!\n",
      "As for this product I can say that it definetely works. But taste is really awful. I don't know how about the others, but aside from Watermelon I've felt a burning feeling in my mouth(like chili-pepper).So every sip is like a little survival for me. It's only my opinion.\n",
      "IrlBeast Aminolytes is a solid product.  I noticed some increase in endurance and considerable increase in recovery time.  The product itself seems quite versatile as well as I used this during pool tournaments as well.  The flavor is a bit strong when used as directed but I found with a little extra water it really settled nicely and a person can stretch this out as I was feeling results from using half to 3/4's of a serving.  It mixed great, few shakes and a swirl occasionally.\n",
      "It is terrible cloyingly SWEET!!!\n",
      "One way to drink it - mix with juice of one lime or lemon.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great product, it helps with recovery and getting me to drink enough water throughout the day. Only one problem, it says it is watermelon flavor. It is actually WATERMELON flavor, if you add one scoop to about 16 oz of water it will kick your ***. However, once i knew this i could adjust the ratio of powder to water. And now the taste is great and not overwhelming. Dont get me wrong I love using products from Beast Sports Nutrition. But the flavor on this one can be a bit much, so just remember start small and you can always add more in.\n",
      "I was searching for a multivitamin supplement for ages. I was looking for somethig that would combine some of the supplements I was already taking or should have been taking. And then after a few days of reviewing product after product I found Beast Packs!\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like the fact that they don't megadose you with fat-soluable vitamins A, D, K, and E. Vitamins that can be overdosed on (because our bodies store the excess unused portions of these vitamins in our body fat), and can cause bad reactions. The doses are still a tad high but thats okay. I also like that the pack includes CLA (which I've been taking anyway), omega-3s via fish oils, DHA, etc. No fishy burps, and a dose of CLA to boot! Thas one supplement I should've been taking (fish oil) and one I was already taking (CLA). I can reduce my supplement pill count as a result. Great stuff, neatly sorted, and even the box is a handy dandy dispenser. Great Product, hope to purchase again when I run out!\n",
      "Works! For capsule with blended carnitine it's pretty good,\n",
      "I also like that it's 1000mg per dose, fast acting you can feel it kick'in!  Just takes 10-15mins. This is my new \"go to\" carnitine, preferably this one other than my previous carnitine \"EVL\" that's also good but this ones got more bounce! \n",
      "Great quality Carnitine from an outstanding company Beast Sports!!  Stack it with their CLA and Fish Oil.  No bad taste, no heart burn, nothing but results.  Would recommend all (3) to others and will continue to use daily\n",
      "Tasteless, inexpensive, easy to swallow. I haven't seen any results quite yet, but still consuming.\n",
      "Works great for me! I was especially interested in this product because of the ease \n",
      "-of-use factor. The capsules have no taste and I do not have to worry about mixing powder.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only recommendation is to not take these capsules on an empty stomach; I'd say that's a fair rule with any supplement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product and a solid creatine matrix! I have seen a dramatic increase in my results. I take the capsules. It can be a lot (6 per day), especially if you don't like taking pills, but the mix is a great option as well. Good deal as well.\n",
      "I love this product! It has a diverse blend and ample doses of clinically validated Creatine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel VERY BEASTLY when taking this product. Recovery time is minimal, strength and growth is maximal.\n",

      "\n",
      "I just started working out again not to long ago and wanted to wait a couple of months before starting any kind of supp's. I started this a couple of weeks ago and really love what it is doing for me. I have seen real nice gains in every movement. I would definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great quality Fish Oil from an outstanding company Beast Sports!!  Stack it with their CLA and Carnitine.  No fish burps, No bad taste, no heart burn, nothing but results.  Would recommend all (3) to others and will continue to use daily\n",
      "No fish burps! I take 3-4 a day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ok so I have been meaning to grab a fish oil and when placing my cybro order I saw the beast fish oil and threw it in the cart.. I have tried various brand fish oils before so I was pleased to see a \"citrus\" flavor.. well that was not the case.. The bottle says citrus flavor but it is nothing more than fish flavor with a peppery aftertaste. As far as it's effectiveness I'm not really sure about as I just started taking it but you can't really get fish oil wrong .. based on supplement facts seems like a great product.  Gave it a 5/10 on taste as it doesn't taste any different than normal but would have loved a citrus flavored product.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great product.  Although there are protein powders that have it in their blend, sometimes making a shake is not possible.  Eating on time and getting those essential amino acids in your diet is difficult.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoy this BCAA product. I have been taking them for a while now and have seen great results. I think BCAA pill supplements are easier than the powders but that is just my opinion. The bottle says take like 3 servings a day, but I would take 2-3 servings an hour before your workout and another 2-3 servings later in the day. Taking them between meals on off days is always a good idea as well.\n",
      "Hello! These are excellent BCAA, since that moment as I started using them began to notice a surprising difference, in comparison with those BCAA that accepted before! The ratio of the price and quality are amazing! I advise all these a product! separate thanks Bodybuilding.com for production provided by them, I order regularly and it is very happy! ! !\n",
      "Hi, I bought this BCAA and this very good item! Capsules easy to drink with water of juice before and after workout. I drink with 10-15oz water/juice 6 caps before workout and 10 caps after. Thank you Bodybuilding.com and Betancourt for this great product and low price!\n",
      "So far after a month I have seen pretty good results with these BCAA's. I take about 4 servings a day but still for the price it is a good deal.\n",
      "This is a great product. Good serving size and it doesn't take long before you can feel the tingly effects. Great product to supplement with your pre and post workouts. Be sure to take with Taurine, it's great!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product, I recommend this for people who do not like stimulant pre-workouts full of caffeine.  \n",
      "is a good and delicious's taken in a timely manner.\n",
      "These chewies are extremely tart.  I will not order these again.  You have to separate the different colors because if you mix them they taste terrible.  Even when you separate the different berry flavors so that you're eating the same ones, they still taste bad.  Go with Universal.  So much better tasting.\n",
      "Get it when it's on a good price this stuff is awesome and 1 scoop is all you need for daily intake. They taste like candy with just a little powder taste to them \n",
      "Pills are sized okay for me. I like the pills that can be easily broken in to half in case I would like to reduce my dosage\n",
      "The pills are huge and hard to swallow\n",

      "My wife says they definitely help to not feel hungry. They do cause some stomach discomfort if they are not taken with food. \n",
      "I bought this for my wife and she loves it. really helps her when she hungry at work. first bottle ran out now she got my to buy 2 more.10 out of 10\n",
      "Good stuff. Losing visceral fat very fast. But i twiced a daily doses. ;)\n",
      "Love the cap, and it is made from quality materials.  However, the sizing runs small.  I wear a 7 1/2 and I purchased the largest size, L/XL.  The cap is pretty tight and with all day wear gives me a headache.\n",
      "I'm on the fence with the orange cream protein shake. I'm a big fan of Betty lou's, particularly the PEANUT BUTTER POWDER, so I had high hopes for the orange cream. The shake is filling. You can mix it in a shaker, blending isn't mandatory. My problem is that after two sips the flavor was overwhelming for me, it was too much too rich and sickeningly sweet. You have to really want to drink a creamcicle. I'm writing this review to help people who are looking for that creamcicle flavor, who love it, YOU WILL WANT THIS. It also reminded me of the orange cream lifesaver, for me it's way too candy like. However, I do have hopes that I can mix the chocolate UMP( please let that work!) or flavor homemade icing and use in muffin batter. My hope is that I can temper the coylingly sweetness and make it more palatable. I hope this helps you.\n",
      "Use this during prep!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love using this product!  Mixes easily to make protein shakes and adds a really nice flavor!  Like the fact that it's organic as well!\n",
      "This is a great tasting product.  Also, it being organic is even better.  Easy to mix in your oatmeal or smoothies. I highly recommend it if you want that peanut butter taste with lower calories and fat.  \n",
      "This is the perfect way for peanut butter junkies to get the flavor without all of the added fat. It also makes mixing protein shakes and baking easier without having to deal with the mess that regular peanut butter creates. The product is very transportable and tastes great. The only downside (if any) is that you need to added double the amount in order to get the best flavor. When compared to PBS by Bell Plantation, this product is not as potent, so you do use more it it. I would recommend that you but 2-4 jars is you really like the peanut butter flavor to be strong in your recipes. But overall, this is a great product that I highly recommend to all peanut butter lovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love Peanut Butter but would rarely eat it since it was high in calories/fat. I was recently doing my grocery shopping at a well know grocery store and just happen to come across this product.Super excited and bought it. I added water and it tasted great!! Also put it in my protein shake. Right away I posted it on facebook and recommended it to all my friends. Love the product and tastes great!\n",
      "Powdered peanut butter may sound strange but this tastes amazing and for less than 1/4 of the calories of normal peanut butter. In my opinion this actually tasted better than my normal peanut butter. Great for cutting and can be used for a variety of things. I've bought many products but this is the first review I've done, I just had to say how great this product really is.\n",
      "This will be a staple in my kitchen. The high calorie and high fat oils are removed leaving the flavor and protein behind. A great substition for standard peanut butter in your protein shakes.\n",
      "It's powder butter. Cool\n",
      "SO good!! 45 calories vs. 190 . . . don't mind if i do!! \n",
      "Mixes well with water to form a thin spread for rice cakes. Guilt free and tastes great! I also add to my cooked oatmeal.\n",
      "Great product.  Currently using for leaning out phase of diet.  Love the increased strength.  \n",
      "One of the best bcaa's I've ever tried as a natural bodybuilder having my amminos is essential this product helps keep me looking full and strong love this product\n",
      "I've taken this product. Stopped. Then, took it again. I did notice a difference. I lift heavy. It does help. Beverly products are not the cheapest, but they are among the best. I reccomend this product for the serious person.\n",
      "I take five pills before Cardio and after and I find it helps! with all Beverly Products though I do find them to be a bit pricey!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Staple supplement. Found this to be the best multi vitamin for me. I have tried numerous other multi's but Ultra4 always makes me feel better. Outside of training pak multi's, this is by far the best multi for serious lifters.\n",
      "I have been taking this product for a few months now, and I have noticed that I have seen a slight increase in my energy, but more than that, I have also noticed that through the sick season, that I was not getting sick at all! Very impressive stuff, will continue to order!\n",
      "ThIs product works great!  I wasn't so keen on the idea of the black cherry flavor, however I have found that you can mix almost any flavor of pre-workout in with the black cherry and it taste great!\n",
      "I loved it!!! The flavor is good enough to drink with just water, and it's SO convenient to have both BCAAs and Glutamine in on supplement. It was effective in curbing cravings between meals, and helped me make the most of my morning fasted cardio. I recently tried to cut corners and get generic BCAAs and Glutamine, but was forced to get them separately and the taste is awful!!! I WILL DEFINITELY BE GOING BACK TO BEVERLY!! :) \n",
      "I have been taking this product for a little over a month now. Will continue to finish this bottle, and reorder. I have always been very pleased with Beverly Products in general. UMP is my favorite, along with Muscle Provider. I believe  it's too soon to tell with the Glutamine Select. The Black Cherry flavor is really good and it mixes well in 8 ozs of water. Continual shaking isn't necessary.\n",
      "This product is good, it reduced the amount of soreness from my workouts. Butte one problem I did have with it, is that when mixed alone it created a lot of foam and had about bitter taste to it. But overall good product for the price you pay. \n",
      " This product definitely contributes to improved recovery. The taste by itself isn't very good, so I mix it with my Dutch Chocolate Whey Protein post-workout and it makes a great chocolate/cherry flavored shake.\n",
      "I've tried this product and then tried going without it. I went back on it because it works. Especially helpful when you take it during a heavy,intense, workout. It keeps you going, increases stamina. I do recommend this product.\n",
      "Lean Out curbs my sugar cravings and I feel more energetic.  I've tried other products, but Lean Out works for me especially with UMP\n",
      "I've used Lean Out for about a year now and it works great.  It improves my energy and helps with sugar cravings as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent product. I used it to prepare for 3 bodybuilding shows this year. I took 6 per day. 2 in the morning with a meal, 2 mid day with a meal and 2 with dinner. I won my wieght class in all 3 shows-2 of the shows National Qualifiers. I stacked this with Beverly Mass Amino's.\n",
      "Purchased this to help with leaning out.  So far it appears to be working well and combined with my weight workouts and cardio my weight is stabilizing and I continue to make improvements.  \n",
      "I have used lean out and it does help you achieve your weight loss goals.  Beverly International products are great.\n",
      "I enjoyed this product. I didn't use it as directed (up to 4 times a day) but I did use it between 2-3 times. Normally one in the morning, which was also close to pre workout and one around lunch time or later. I felt very clean energy and made workouts very efficient. Had a lot of energy during workouts and I did \"lean out\" even with my increased caloric phase. I would definitely get this again for the energy boost as well as keeping a \"bulking\" diet in check. \n",
      "Lean out really helped me... Well, lean out, and drop body fat leading up to my show. I stacked it with quadracarn and 7keto. Love Beverly products!\n",
      "Helps keep my fat in check.\n",
      "I have been taking Lean Out along with 7-Keto Musclean for about the past month. Along with watching my diet and working out, they have helped me lose about 8lbs. so far.\n",
      "Great fatburner with no jitters.\n",
      "I purchased this product about a month ago hoping that this mass gainer would taste good how the reviews claim. But that was far from the truth. The protein doesn't blend well even if you put in a blender. It's consistency is really thick, even if you add more water, it still feels like you are swallowing oatmeal. The flavor isn't \"Delicious\" either. it's really bland and I will not be ordering from this maker anymore. I'm gona stick with ON and Musclepharm since their protein powders mix easily in just a blender bottle. I guess the old saying is true, \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\". Don't order this product if you have never tried it before. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!\n",
      "Great powder, taste is amazing. Love what's in it but my only complaint is it's consistency. Hard to mix in a standard shaker without getting hard to remove clumps stuck in corners and the sides of the shaker. Switched my shakes to blender, I instantly had no problem at all.  \n",
      "Maybe you need 4 consecutive bottles like this to see results which will cost you a lot so I prefer spending money on other BCAA supplement with half the price and get same results.\n",
      "This is a great product,excellent quality of BCAA,i felt that i recover much faster from my workouts and i was able to add some lean mass too.\n",
      "This product is a must for serious athletes and bodybuilders too.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff is amazing. Felt like I could pick up a house when using it. As I go back and look at my history I realize that my lifts peaked while using this . The only problem was that I ordered the pills which were way too big and I needed to take about 6 for the right dosage ...for me....I just ordered to powder form to help me with the #200kchallenge - looking forward to it\n",
      "A must have for those who are 40+ Made some great gains using Beverly International.. This one I take it in the morning and as my preworkout! Great stuff man... \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First let me say that I have tried a number of different protein powders from various manufacturers; even those with big name bodybuilders and athletes promoting them.  My review is not a knock against any of them, but I can say with complete honesty that I have now found my personal best/favorite protein powder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of egg, beef and whey protein delivers as promised and the ease with which it mixes is much appreciated.  The vanilla flavor is spot on and this is coming from a hopeless chocolate junkie.  I like to mix mine with coconut milk, a banana, and some vitamin/mineral powder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short - I am thoroughly impressed with the product.  We all get protein powder in some form or another and we know enough to look for the best sources, the best taste, and those that mix the best.  Well - look no further.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only caveat is this ... Be prepared to pay more as Beverly International (BI)  products do not come cheap.  Bodybuilding.com has some of the best prices out there for BI products.  I have also seen some deals on Amazon.  You can buy direct from BI and sometimes they reward you with discounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good luck and stay fit.\n",
      "Excellent product... tastes great, mixes easy.  Not chalky or gritty.  I use this \"old school\" protein formula  post workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried tons of different protein shakes because they all have a gritty chalk taste until now. A friend of mind told me about BI and I am now a fan! \n",
      "Provosyn is my all time favorite tasting protein powder....by far. I love the \"old school\" ingredients and make up of this protein. Awesome!\n",
      "Have been using Beverly for years unsurpassed quality and taste. They don't have to advertise because there  products are so incredible blows all other proteins away. Try it and you will never go back.\n",
      "This is the best thing I had found love Orange proteins , this one is the cheapest by serving by far and was worried about people pineapple in it but it taste wonderful, I mix with two glasses of whole milk\n",
      "I didn't see any changes, but I already eat pretty clean. Not buying again.\n",
      "I didn't really see any differences....\n",
      "I love this bikini ready shake, it controls my appetite, helps with my digestion, and it tastes sooooo good. I'm very picky with taste, and with this shake there's no chalky after taste. It's like chocolate milk Very smooth, smells great, I drink a lot of it because it's so good.\n",
      "Energy is great. However it caused upset stomach for me everyday i had taken it after day 3. I am having to stop taking it. \n",
      "\n",
      "There's no doubt that  Biotab Nutraceuticals gives you a boost.  I could feel the energy working within me in minutes. The list of ingredients is a who's who (or make that what's what) of natural male enhancement stimulants:  ***** goat weed, deer antler velvet, tribulus and yohimbe (bark) extracts, L-Arginine, and Korean ginseng extract.  Despite all the goodness, it made me jittery, and it also gave me an upset stomach.  I lost my appetite most of the time I took it.  Undoubtedly, others have received better results, but my experience was not a pleasant one--even if I skipped using it a day or so. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I would rate this pre-workout product about the best one I have tried over the years. It mixes very well with very little foam and the taste is not bad. I have only used the fruit punch. I could feel the product working as I noticed a difference if I did not take it before my workout. I plan on using this product again for sure. So far the price has been good too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried this during the promotional period when it was new. I see alot of people didnt really like it but i did. I thought the lemon was better than the yellow fever. I did use this after a lower stim pre workout cycle so i didnt feel jitters in my whole body but i definetly knew it was working. I got great pumps and increased focus while cycling the product. I will buy it again for my tune up cycle. \n",
      "This is the 3rd preworkout that I have tried and I was not impressed. I had to use less water to avoid a watery taste. At times it gave me gut rot but that might have been because of an empty stomach as well. I also rarely felt any effect from this pre workout as well. The only reason I bought it was because it was cheap.\n",
      "I enjoyed this product. I felt like the jitters were very minimal compared to others that I have used. I was focused and just felt all around more motivated and energetic going into my workout. The only thing I did not like about this product was that it is super powdery so it made a bit of a mess. Overall I would recommend this product.\n",
      "This is not the most powerfull pre-workout I've tried but it is effective. Radioactive lemon taste good\n",
      "I was excited when I smelled this pre-workout because it smells like blueberries. But it tastes horrible! It doesn't do anything for me like other pre-workouts do. So basically you suffer while drinking it for no help whatsoever. Very disappointing. \n",
      "i didn't actual use the product because the taste was so bad.\n",
      "I went out on a limb and tried this product when it was on a promotional sale. I have tried dozens of pre-workout products and like to change things up from time to time. I have to say this was a disappointment all around. I started as instructed with a single level scoop and honestly did not even feel like I had had a cup of coffee. I had to double the usage to even get a mild pump to workout. I am suffering through the remaining amount on my abs and core workouts only. I would not recommend this product for anyone that has been using preworkouts for any length of time, possibly for someone just starting out they may have better results.  \n",
      "Very underwhelming results.\n",
      "I absolutely love this protein. It's clean, and has no junk in it and theirs no bloating.\n",
      "I've been waiting for a protein concentrate with no junk in it. This protein taste like milk. That's It!!!!! One word EXCELLENT!! \n",
      "I can't wait for the bigger container.\n",
      "Excellent product. I have used close to 20 jugs of it during my 6 month bulking cycle.  It tastes very good, mixes extremely well (only have to use a shaker, no blender), and it works.  High in protein and carbs, low in sugar compared to other gainers.   I would imagine the other guys that gave it a poor review probably haven't used many gainers.   Of course there's a little bloating afterwards, you just ingested 1000 calories in one drink.   I tried Muscle Tech gainer, Muscle Tech Extreme 2000, and Besast Mass when the Monstrous was out of stock.  The monstrous was by far my favorite, with the Beast in 2nd. \n",
      "The flavor was sub-par what I expect from a big protein mass-builder brand. I often found myself mixing in peanut butter, or Hershey's syrup to give it a real chocolate flavor. The product does not mix well at ALL. I have tried spoon stirring, blending in a mixer (nutrabullet) to no avail. It also causes severe bloating, and an increase in bowel movements throughout the day (I'm very regular as-is). The only question is what to do with all the remaining powder...\n",
      "Price and nutrition content are good, but it tastes disgusting.  It might be OK mixing it with something else.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Great deal of buy 2 get 1 free. Like the smaller 20oz. Mixes my supplements great everytime. Easy to clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: I love the new 32oz size and bought 3 of them to use as daily water bottles! Instead of carrying around a gallon jug, I bring my 32oz. Blender Bottle everywhere I go! Best part is that I don't have to worry about it leaking and it fits perfectly in my car's cup holder Win win!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Blender Bottles are the ONLY shaker bottles that I buy. They have the prefect sizes - 20oz to mix my pre-workouts and the 28oz to mix my BCAA's and protein shakes. They are durable and most importantly - they do not leak (unless you forget to close the flap...it's happened to me before!). Also, Bodybuilding.com has the best prices for Blender Bottles hands down!\n",
      "Great look, I love the new colors. The tops crack all the time. \n",
      "Best shake bottle I've ever used. It was quick and thoroughly mixed. I'm thrilled with it.\n",
      "The bottle is OK, but half the height of the photo of it in the online store.\n",
      "The photo should be replaced with one that is of the actual product being shipped.\n",
      "But it's a good bottle anyway, just too small.\n",
      "The name says it \"Classic\". Tried and true, works every time. I have a one (my fiance stole the other two) and we love em. Blends, easy clean up and so far no smell. Recommend for anyone looking for a solid shaker. \n",
      "I bought this for my son when  he makes his protein shakes and he likes it better than a regular shaker bottle.  He says it mixes well and there are no lumps or gritty texture when he uses it. \n",
      "Love these bottles! They help blend even my thickest protein shakes. From Muscle Milk to Corwhey, this thing did the trick! However, I recommend making sure the water is put in first over the shaker ball then putting the powder on top as doing it the other way around makes it clumpy. Don't leave protein sitting in it after you're done drinking it because it will make the bottle smell absolutely terrible.\n",

      "I love these bottles! They're the only thing I use!\n",
      "Works great for me, I usually mix my aminos in this and use it pre and during workouts. Get's the job done! No leakages or anything which I can appreciate.\n",
      "Perfect for my amino energy drink and shakes. I love the carry loop and the colors\n",
      "Can never have to many! More colors needed. LOL \n",
      "Awesome \n",
      "A must have for anyone. Well made shaker bottle. Thick wall construction of the bottle and the lid. Worry-proof sealing prevent leaks at the mouth and at the lid. Wider mouth for drinking and pouring. Convenient hoop for attaching a clip to hang from gym bag or on a finger while carrying a hand full of items. \n",
      "I really like these blender bottles. I use them to blend my protein powders n aminos. Their da perfect size as well.\n",
      "cheap and does what is supposed, bought the 20oz size and its perfect.\n",

      "Great Bottle.  Love the colors.  Doesn't leak and mixes well.  I have lots of these.  Couldn't beat the deal either!  Thanks bodybuilding.com!\n",

      "Awesome. Couldn't be happier with the product. \n",
      "20oz Blender bottles are the best specially in full coloured.\n",
      "Does the job! Never have any problems with clumping. I have the smaller size and my husband has the larger size and we have no complaints!! \n",

      "\n",
      "I ordered (3) bottles -- 1 full color black and 2 clear/black -- thinking all bottles came with the handy hook/ring for carrying, as was shown in the photos.  Unfortunately, only the full color black had this ring.  The other two had a different type of cover with no ring.  Rating 7.\n",
      "First experience with bodybuilding.com and it was fabulous! I got 3 bottles for the price of 2 and  could'nt be happier. The order arrived just 2 days after ordering and the was also great samples included. I have already made another purchase, such a great site and community. \n",
      "The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because I wish it mixed up my supplements a little better but eventually it works so I've had little to complain about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent size... But, it appears that the measurements are wrong. Tried two different bottles, against multiple measuring cups, and got the same results. Also, ordered the 32 ounce bottle, received the 28 ounce with a 32 ounce sticker. \n",
      "\n",
      "I started using the Blender Bottle 5 months ago and it great. I don't know if it's better or not than other mixing bottles because this is the only one that I have tried. But I definitely recommend it as the powders get well-mixed with water/milk \n",
      "BlenderBottle is a great product for mixing preworkouts or protein powder.  The 20oz is perfect for the small amounts like the teaspoon or so of preworkout I mix and the 32 is good for larger portion like post workout protein and recovery mixes.  I just measure out my powders in the mornings directly into the bottle and pack them wherever I'm going, add water, and shake whenever it's time.\n",
      "Best portable hand blender\n",
      "Works well.  Very convenient, sure beats washing a blender each time I make a shake.  Washes easily on the top rack of my dishwasher.\n",
      "Works great. Easy to clean. The 3 pack allowed me to take multiple supplements without cleaning constantly \n",
      "\n",
      "This is my first blender bottle and it is amazing. I use it for my pre-workout and will be using it for other things as well. This is a must have if you haven't purchased it already\n",

      "Have fun working out! \n",
      "I've only been using my product for a short period of time.  Today, when screwing my lid on, the lid separated and came apart.  The part where the small handle separated from the part with the threads.  I would like a replacement, because I do like this bottle much more than others that I've used.  The way it came apart seems like it was a manufacturing defect and hopefully an anomaly.  \n",
      "Best mixer cup I have found, no leaks and mixes really good.\n",
      "Purchased two blender bottles and they turned out great. Dishwasher safe, very efficient, and at a decent price.\n",
      "Doesn't spill, good so far\n",
      "Best shaker bottle there is.  No sense in using anything else.  Got rid of all my other shaker bottles.  This mixes up anything, it's built well, built simply, no leakage whatsoever, lasts and lasts, virtually indestructible.  I have six of them!  I've owned them for at least a year and a half, and I use them all daily, and they all work just as well as the day I got them.  I have one each for: my first-thing-in-the-am shake, pre workout shake, post workout shake, nighttime casein, and another I use for BCAA drink throughout the day, and one wild card/extra.  When you see Blender Bottles all around the gym, it's not because they're \"cool,\" it's because people who use them know they're the best!\n",
      "I own 4 of these and have no problems with any of them. \n",
      "Holds liquids without leaking, mixes whey protein better than not using a blender ball  and relatively easy to clean. Can't say anything bad about it.\n",
      "Can't imagine what I could want more in a bottle for blending than I get in the BlenderBottle.\n",
      "The 20oz bottle is big enough for my needs,, Certainly blends for me,, there were no clumps and it wasn't gritty like it would've been if I had just stirred with a spoon. And full color option makes your bottle not look bland! I might buy a 28oz in the future.\n",
      "I've had mine for 3 years and decided to buy a new one for the color. They all work great and everything mixes well. I threw away the blender ball since I hated washing it and everything still mixes great without it. Overall a great product!\n",
      "\n",
      "I make order after order of these as I find friends snagging them up as they are such good bottles.  They survive the dish washer great, and seal awesome with no leaks in any of my long time bottles.  I have dropped them from out second story workout room on accident to a concrete floor and that one survived the fall amazingly landing on its top as well.  Quality made, long lasting, good price point (especially with deals here at BB.com), I don't know what more you can ask for.\n",
      "Does what it is suposed to do! Best price/quality bottle on the market in my opinion! \n",
      "\n",
      "It's cheap and it gets the job done really well.  I've used more expensive shakers that don't do half as good a job.  Seals tight, mixes perfectly, and is easy to drink out of.  Highly recommend!\n",

      "I have 3 GNC blender bottles that leak terribly when you shake them. I decided to order some of the original Blender Bottles off of Bodybuilding.com, They work great. No leaking. I would recommend these to anyone as the go-to shaker bottle. 10/10 for me\n",
      "LOVE this bottle! It's the perfect size for me and it doesn't have any funky smells. The only small issue I have is that powder tends to get stuck in the bottom of the bottle. I solved this by putting a small layer of liquid first, then add powder, then add more liquid. That totally solves the problem.\n",

      "Currently on my 4th  bottle. 3rd one this year.  Lost my original about a 6 months ago and purchased a newer one with the new design and immediately noticed the plastic lid was a different kind of plastic.  After screwing the lid on and off for a couple months the lid cracked. I ordered another one and it cracked on my two days ago after only a month of use.  I'm really disappointed in longevity of these \"newer bottles,\" I just received my 4th one (the MusclePharm bottle) and i can already tell the difference between the plastic lids.  This lid does not have the hook thing on top and my fingers are crossed that this one will actually last [at least] the rest of the year.\n",
      "I've had 2 of the bottles I ordered break on me. I'm pretty sure it happened in the dishwasher so I might just start hand washing these. The top twists off area cracked around the mouthpiece and top cap. Not really sure how that can happen since it looks like all one piece. I'll be returning these back to bodybuilding.com for a refund. \n",
      "I enjoy using the blender bottle, its  great for mixing my whey thoroughly without any clumps and residues like the norm ones.\n",
      "I felt I needed a shaker bottle coz its much easier. Shaking a water bottle with protein powders, BCAA powders or pre-workout powders just doesn't do it for me. Using the a blender machine is just to tedious when I'm in a hurry. So, I thought that it was time to invest in one. ( I used to make fun of others who always had this at the gym, now I'm one of them) I take this bottles everywhere when I need to go somewhere to workout or when I'm out for a long while and need a protein shake so I don't wolf down unnecessary junk food coz I'm too hungry. This particular one is the best coz it does not spill out when its in the bag (which was my main concern).\n",
      "\n",
      "I give this a 10 coz I love it. But I haven't tried other brands to compare it to.\n",
      "The picture showed a big blender bottle so that's what I assumed I was buying, they sent this tiny little one. Not sure if a mistake or just false advertising.\n",
      "Great product. Simple to use. I use it every day when I go I the gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is such a great bottle to use for protein shakes. I use mine at least 2/3 times a day and it works really well, leaving no lumps or anything behind. It is very durable and sturdy and the choices of colors and sizes are great to suite everyone's needs.\n",
      "it's great.  it's a small bottle, tho.  so as long as you are aware.  The cap snaps on really hard.  You really have to make sure it's in place and even pound it down.  I've never had a bottle that was that tough.  But i guess that also means it's going to be that much less likely to accidentally come open. I love the shaker ball.  Works great.  Works better than the spider bottles..although I like those a lot, too.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Great value!\n",
      "\n",
      "Best bottle to blend you're protein. I've dropped it many times and it holds up. Eventually after throwing one old one I had in to a basket repetitively over and over, it cracked slightly near the top eventually causing a leakage, but it still took allot of abuse and that was my fault. No point in getting any other bottle to blend you're protein this one does the job the best, no clumping. \n",
      "These bottles are an excellent pickup. They look good and they work to perfection. The ball whisks protein powder into a smooth consistent drink and I've never had a leak. To top it off, the price is right.\n",
      "Best bottle I have used \n",
      "I purchased the smaller sized bottle, and it's perfect for me because I only drink a serving after going to the gym. The purple and clear combo is also very, very cute! Looks just as great in person as it does in the image. Overall good quality, really cute and does what it's supposed to properly!!\n",
      "I have purchased several of these bottles elsewhere but Bodybuilding has the best price on them. These bottles are great to mix my protein powder.  Bodybuilding,com rules. \n",
      "I love this size, I never filled the tall one and it would tip over and just takes up more space than it needed to, this size is perfect for anything and I don't mind carrying it around at the gym and setting it down. It seals well and can take a hit without popping open.\n",
      "BEST SHAKER!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Classic Blender Bottle, what else is there to say.  Great shaker that never leaks, and is always reliable.\n",
      "I have three of these and they are great. Top snaps in place tightly so no shaking and it flying everywhere when the top comes unsnapped. Great product and a great price.\n",
      "Works great! A word to the wise though. When blending your protein, shake until the drink is ready. Stopping before its done leads to clumps and its pretty gross lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blends my protein powder so well and it's very easy to clean. The smaller bottle is perfect for 8oz of protein shake. The top closes very tight and doesn't spill or leak.\n",
      "i have like 6 of these cups, and ive had them for a little over a year probably, and recently one by one the lids to each one of them began splitting in a circle around the edge.  i think this is due to repetitive dishwasher trips so id advise people to wash the lids by hand because now i have no tops.  But i guess over a year isnt a bad run for a $6 item haha\n",
      "The best I ever had. Nice colors, nice design and easy to wash. Mixes powders very well.\n",
      "Best thing to happen to protein powder and water IMHO\n",
      "Got the 20 oz shakers and love it! It's the perfect size to be mobile with me and mixes everything perfectly. I will be stocking my cabinets with more!\n",
      "Overall, I like it. This shaker works very well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Casein protein powder that I use tends to clump-up when mixing. It still takes a long time to get the clumps to break apart with this shaker, but it eventually does it. It seems to work best if I fill the bottle about half-way, then mix everything together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sturdy construction. I've dropped it a couple times with no problems. The lid is a little hard to close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easy to clean in a dishwasher, but I think the lid should be washed by hand because of it's odd shape.\n",
      "Pretty good !\n",
      "\n",
      "I read a lot of the reviews and everybody had a high rating for this product. Sorry to say but I wasn't as impressed with the blender bottle as everyone else. The bottle itself was great it fit good in my hand for when I was mixing my supplements and the cap once it snapped was very secure. The problem I had was the spring ball in my opinion was to light. I had to use a blender after shaking the bottle for five minutes. It could be that the liquid I am forced to use could be part of the problem. So that's my experience with the bottle blender, sorry you asked.\n",
      "These are just awesome. Great quality. Once snapped on you can shake them and not be worried about the leaking everywhere. I just use them as normal cups for water most of the time too\n",
      "Cheap and working well. What else can I say?\n",
      "\n",
      "From mixing protein shakes to scrambling eggs to just drinking water on a daily basis; I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. \n",

      "Buy it, you will love it!\n",
      "My first shaker is a Blender Bottle, and I have tried several others on the market, only to come back to this brand. It is simple, sturdy and works well. Overall, it's a great product!\n",
      "This blender bottle is really well made and doesn't leak. It is easy to clean and doesn't stain from colours. The wide mouth is a lot more helpful than I though it would be, no more overcast of protein powder on my counter!\n",
      "This shaker is definitely sturdy, made with a thick casing. The overall design is great. The portion size exceptional and the spout is pretty heavy-duty, meaning it's not going to pry open while shaking. It also stays put when open, so you can gulp down your drink without it hitting you or flopping awkwardly. The ball shaker style is perfect, creating minimal froth & mixes my chia seeds in well. The seal is excellent during shaking although I haven't tried taking it somewhere already filled / tilted on its side. The colors are a great after-thought because although not necessary for its primary function, it's cool to have the choices. Clean-up is super easy, with the bottle opening being more than large enough for both a man or woman.\n",
      "Perfect! Great size, the ball mixes my protein really well, easy to use, and easy to clean. My favorite blender bottle! \n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "This product is very useful and makes life alot easier especially when your in a hurry\n",
      "Excellent product. I always worry about the seal when it comes to bottles like these and they are great! I've never spilled a drop! \n",
      "\n",

      "Have two of them, one 20oz and one 28oz, both are great, no complaints. WIll buy more in the future :).\n",
      "Super easy to use!!! But more importantly easy to CLEAN!!!!  I highly recommend this shaker bottle.\n",
      "Does the job perfectly\n",
      "I go nowhere without my bottle. Love these things!\n",
      "Mixes my protein powder very smoothly and so far, absolutely no leakage. Fantastic.\n",
      "Does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is very durable and there are no leaks. I've never had a problem with the protein powder clumping and it mixes it very well. I just ordered my second one yesterday! I love that there are many colors to choose from.\n",
      "Holds up to daily wear and tear & adorable colors available.\n",
      "Clearly the perfect bottle! Great looks but most importantly high quality with no leaks!\n",
      "I love this bottle. Very sturdy and high quality. I just bought a second one :) \n",
      "Very good bottle.  Only reason I give it a 9 is because the cap that covers the drink/pour opening is overly tight.\n",
      "Great Bottle.  Does What it is supposed to.\n",
      "Great bottle, mixes all types of protein really well.  Have used it also for pre and post workout mixes and again does an outstanding job.  The cap on the lid is a little bit finicky though.\n",
      "This bottle surprised me I thought that it would be a flimsy cheap bottle which the company would want you to buy next one maybe in a couple months but it actually was not it was made out of some sort of hard plastic. It fell couple and it was fine it didn't crackle, break or anything it's very durable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought 2 more one for myself and 1 for my sister. It's a very nice quality bottle. I keep it with me every time. :D\n",
      "I love the Blender Bottle. I have 3 and the lids are all interchangeable. Mixes everything really well. Sometimes the powder gets stuck in the opening where you drink but that is fixed tapping the bottle on the counter and shaking some more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the product is great. It mixes well and I haven't had any instances of clumping. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the reason why I gave it a 5, is the top cracked along the seam after 3 washes, rendering it useless. Not sure if this a common occurrence or If I got a lemon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would give the product another chance. \n",
      "First time buying this brand and love it. I don't get any clumps mixing protein or my preworkout because of the whisk ball. And the lid is super secure and I don't have any leaks. \n",

      "shake well no leaks \n",

      "I have used this shaker for probably about 6 years and have gone through multiple. I really loved them till about a year ago and then all of the sudden all of the newer ones started cracking above the threads on the lid after only a month or two's use. I used to have about 12 of these in my cupboards at all times and now I'm down to two due to the above issue. They must be trying to cut corners and go with some cheaper plastic nowadays. Anyways time to find a new shaker.\n",

This product so far has been extremely useful and I'm happy I never feel like I waste any of my supplements anymore. \n",
      "I also use these bottles as a norm water bottle and I can say that it's a cool thing to have and a nice feeling to walk around with a metal blender in your bottle LOL. Also this product has  measurements on the side which are really helpful.\n",
      "I went through 2 bodybuilding.com shaker bottles. Both were leaky, fragile pieces of junk. After getting fed up with the new and improve design, I decided to go shaker shopping. After sifting through many reviews, I selected the Blender Bottle 28oz. So far so good. It's definitly leak proof (turned it upside down/shook it in all sorts of crazy ways). There's not much I can really say other than that it's reliable. The wire wisk ball is a a useful but rather unnecessary addition. My powders dissolve with rigorous shaking for 30 secs with out it.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have a \"Bodybuilding.com\" shaker bottle at home but needed one for when I am at college... this Blender bottle works great! I think the idea of the metal ball also works well. Now mixes dont get caught on the filter at the top of the cup.\n",
      "I love this shaker bottle.  I own 3 of them now and will probably end up buying more eventually.  The ball really helps to blend my drinks together perfectly.  Also, it fits perfectly in my cup holders in my car.  I would recommend this to everyone who wants a shaker bottle.\n",

      "simply the best bottle i have ever used, very high quality plastic, dont even know how many times ive dropped it and its still in 100% condition! not to mention it also comes with a little metal whisk to de-clump whatever you are mixing even more. i would deffinately suggest investing in a blender bottle even though it costs a little more than your average bodybuilding.com shaker. I also bought a second shaker because i know its only a matter of time before someone steals one, thats how good these shakers are\n",

You dont have to shake nearly as hard wtih the ball doing the work..especially when your arms barely work rigth after a good workout. And cleaning is much easier than expected.

      "THE BEST PROTEIN SHAKER PERIOD. You can put NO-xplode in it and shake the (opposite of Heaven) out of it and not worry about the expansion causing product to drip onto your expensive clothes. This thing makes all those free shakers you've gotten in the past, suck (insert noun here).\n",
      " This is the best bottle I have owned, I will definitely order more of these!\n",
      "This bottle is a replacement of one I lost a few weeks ago while traveling. Its not the first one of its kind I have owned so this is a second purchase of this product. I don't use the wire ball that comes with it very often, as I can usually shake the bottle enough to mix the protein powders I use the most (Optimum Nutrition Whey and Casein). This bottle does what I need it to do and fits in the cupholders in my truck and the planes I fly so it works for me perfectly. Its nice and sturdy and does not leak. Thats all I can ask of a blender bottle.\n",

      "Blender Bottle is Awesome! I've used many shaker bottle products but by far this is the best. If you give it a good shake you have ZERO powder clumps and everything goes down smooth. Plus the spout is perfect size!\n",
      "i bought the small bottle. A friend of mine bought one at GNC, I tried it and liked it then. Very good at breaking up those little clumps. I like the smaller size to for a small, thick drink. It is easier to carry around than one of the larger cups that you can get on here (of which i also have).\n",
      "wow nice dude! the best !\n",
      "Amazing product!  It will mix anything!  I shake for 5-10 seconds max &amp;amp; everything is blended well.\n",
      "By far the best blender cup I've ever used.  The wire whisk ball does a fantastic job of breaking up and mixing the powder.  For on the go or don't have an actual blender I would recommend this cup.  Far and away the best one I've found.\n",
      "I love my blender bottle... take it everywhere with me. My last one made it through a couple military deployments to iraq, and I basically used the crap out of it daily. Going to buy 2 more in different colors. By far, the best shaker bottle I've ever owned.\n",
      "Works awesome.  I was a little miffed that I didn't get to pick the color and when I got it the bottle was pink.\n",
      "I like this bottle the whisk ball concept is great and works perfectly very quick. Leakage is hardly an issue have had a couple drops come out when shaking.  However i have noticed bottles with that gel seal thing always come off and end up worse off than if they didnt have it.  Overall i will order another one of these next time i buy on here prob.\n",

      "This is a great shaker cup! I mainly use it to mix my mass tech shakes, since the normal 20 oz cups just won't cut it. It's built very well, and the heavier gauge blender ball works great. The only downside is that it won't fit in my lunch box for work.\n",
      "Comes in handy. I have these in the gym bag. Creatine, pre and an emergency protein just in case. Love the pill slot and the stack-ability. Had to go back and get more. Love them and recommend them. Small and they don't take up too much space. \n",

At 75% protein per serving, it has WAY more protein than Pro JYM (61%), and Syntha 6 (47%).  Also, I agree that both Pro JYM and Syntha 6 taste better than this protein, but the ingredient list on those other two is kind of ridiculous.  Gelatin? Palm Oil? Sunflower Oil? Corn Syrup Solids? I realize these things probably won't harm you any more than the other garbage we all put in our bodies, but the Blue Star ingredient list is pretty clean.  And with that considered, it tastes pretty darn good for not having a bunch of extra junk in it.  \n",

      "This protein powder is great and I've tried many different ones.  I like how it's a sustained release protein and it doesn't bother my stomach at all.... like at all.  I think the flavour isn't quite as good as Syntha 6, but it seems you get a better quality serving of protein with this.  Only thing keeping me on the fence is the price because it's quite a bit more expensive than anything else that I've tried.  But the flavour was great, it mixed well, and just really most of all I digested it nicely.  No bloating or anything.  I'll probably end up trying a different flavour and if it's just as good this may become my go-to protein.\n",
      "Its flavoring is perfect.\n",

      "Whey Smooth has become my \"go to\" protein ever since I first tried the Chocolate covered banana flavor. I had very high expectations of this and this truely rose to meet and exceed those expectations. I can honestly say this is EASILY the best tasting peanut butter cup flavor i've ever had. This and chocolate peanut butter cup will be staples in my protein selection! I cant wait to try more flavors of Whey Smooth\n",

Had the flavor worked out to be amazing, then I might have been able to get around it, but sadly the Cinnamon Bun flavor was pretty average overall. My main issue: It's extremely sweet, and honestly that is probably the first time I've ever said that about a protein powder. Usually I'm the one wishing the shakes had MORE sweetness, but this one honestly tasted like I got a mouthful of Stevia along with the protein. The underlying flavor tasted like it would have been great, but I couldn't get over the sweetness.\n",

The consistency is the same as all of their other protein, but where it fails is in the flavor. It is very bland and not very chocolatey. If you like chocolate go for their chocolate or peanut butter and chocolate flavors.\n",
      "I was looking for a good Casein protein powder as an extra protein snack boost in the evening..:I read the reviews and based my decision mainly off of them...now that i have tried it for myself I agree with the great reviews! Low calorie and The taste is great, too.\n",
      "I switched from the traditional  trutein too the natural just to experience the difference. Although there was not significant difference my person preference is the natural version. Both vanilla bean and cinnabar fits my taste buds.  The results are just like the traditional version great results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good product but i'm lactose intolerant. Gave me gas.\n",
      "This is the first tub of Trutein I have tried and I think I found a winner. When searching for a protein, I really liked the idea of a non-proprietary blend and after further research, people said trutein tasted/mixed/digested well, what more could you ask for?\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided I wanted to try Trutein. I went to the body nutrition site and bought sample packs of the original formula and discovered they have the natural version as well, which made me much more inclined to buy that due to no atrificial sugars (hate the metalic after taste from artificials). The original version tasted the same as the Naturals, so it seemed like a no brainer that i'd go with natural. My favorite tasting protein of theirs was the Birthday cake but due to it not having a natural version, I decided to go with my second favorite, cinnabun (chocolate peanutbutter tasted way too sweet for me).\n",
      "\n",
      "I mix this with Almond milk, I love the taste so much, i literally cheat (I guess in a good way?) by going to the gym on rest days just so i give myself an excuse to drink this stuff. I love that this protein's taste has grown on me this much and that I am more motivated to go to the gym because of it. Absolutely fantastic and of all the proteins i've tried, this one gives me the least amount of bloating and most managable protein flatulence, aka won't clear out all the ladies in the room, or the block for that matter (important to some people who have trouble processing dairy).\n",
      "\n",
      "My only requests would be to introduce a Birthday Cake Natural version (i really hope it's possible) and i'd probably cycle between BD cake and cinnabun protein forever. (I have yet to try the dark chocolate or vanilla naturals, but might not need to.)\n",
      "I confess that I have only used this product for 3 days, but I can say the taste is surprisingly delicious, mixes well in a shaker bottle, and I felt no bloating or anything.\n",
      "For me, I want to use more natural protein supplements that have a blend (not just whey isolate) and it seems so many proteins have high sugars, maltodextrin, or corn syrup, this has NONE in it and no artificial colors or flavors.\n",
      "All the different types of proteins have their place; trust me, my closest were starting to look like a mini-bodybuilding.com warehouse!  At this point in my life I wanted to stream line and reduce my supplement consumption and this product is helping me to simplify my supplement regime, without sacrificing quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the BEST blends I have ever had! Mixes perfect, no stomach discomfort, no bloating, the fact that its dk chocolate is a super win for me. Will be a stappel in my nutrition plan!\n",
      "Switched to this protein from ProJym to try it out. The protein blend is great and having it sweetened with stevia is even better. It tastes great just like the original Turtein. It is definitely my favorite protein on the market right now.\n",
      "I just switched to Trutein Naturals. I have always been a fan of the Trutein brand, so when they designed a line of protein powder, without artificial sugar, low carbs and low sodium, I had to try it. Trutein Naturals has a great consistency and it's delicious, not to mention the added bonus of the benefits of protein in one's meal planning. \n",
      "Amazing but the sponge pad is weak .\n",
      "Its nice to have I would buy this for sure all over again love the way that helps you keep your form and the pump it gives you in the shoulders and the biceps....\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this bicep bomber! Had mine for around 5 years and it's still in perfect condition! \n",
      "This bicepbomber is a torture device for isolation. I recently used it the first day and did a grueling workout. Usually, when I did this workout previously without it, I would start to sway my arms and use my back to get the barbell up. NOT WITHTHIS! My arms are still sore as hell 3 days after my workout. A good analogy I like to use Is that it's like always carrying a preacher curl seat around with you. This is an awesome product. Happy with it and don't regret buying it. \n",
      "This bad boy will hit your biceps harder than you think, and with low weight as well. Easy to use and carry in a gym bag is def a plus for me. I shaved off 2 points because the padding on the strap for behind the neck was thin and didn't provide much protection/comfort. Easily replaced, but then again, for such a simple and pricey product, I shouldn't have to!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great tool for working those biceps! I use it for days that I really want to hammer my arms. I recently hit my one rep max P.R. (135lbs on cambered bar) and feel that it is due to the Bicep Bomber; I am always keeping perfect posture and do not regret buy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "the \"harness\" is a little wide for some of my smaller training partners but for me, at 215lbs and 74 inches tall, it is a perfect fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those who have had the strap break on them... I watched a guy break a strap at the gym the other day with his. He was going for a 1 rep max and totally bent his back out of posture, with the harness too low i might add, and of course that puts all the weight on the strap and not the steel harness. Keep good posture, keep that steel harness tucked up more towards your armpits, and the strap will not take as much of the load... it is physics people, PHYSICS!!! ARRGGhhh, now it is time to go get some!\n",
      "The item has already torn and I have only used it maybe 10-15 times with moderate weight. The neck pad is torn and fryed already as well, not very satisfied with this item.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great product. It's build makes it comfortable and effective. Great job body solid!\n",
      "Pros: Solid, Steel, arm pads, does its job, makes you feel a difference compared to regular curls.\n",
      "Cons:Needs a better neck pad\n",
      "I really like my bicep bomber I incorporate it frequently into my bicep routine .. It obv does an excellent job isolating the bicep muscles.. Although every once and a while I believe you should do the same exercises but without help, cheating a little bit on form I feel this will do a good job of fully developing the muscle. Also I would like to add that people frequently come up to me during my workout to ask me where I bought this piece of equipment and so I've sold a few of these! Bodybuilding.com now owes me commission imo lol\n",
      "awesome pumps!\n",
      "\n",
      "I about finished with my first bottle and results are amazing. The pump is outstanding and enhanced ATP levels support  training long hours in the gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent product increases vascularity throughout the body and is more pronounced when training.\n",
      "I work best taking two pills an hour before training, two pills during training and two at the end of the training. They can also be combined with amino acids and bccas.\n",
      "I recommend it 100%, only the price is a bit high.\n",
      "Extremely satisfied. Elite series always a good buy\n",
      "Great item, love the items no issues with this at all! if anything thing for the future add longer legs, 9\" etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bodybuilding.com really does a great job with their Foundation products! They are high quality and very inexpensively priced! The Cookies and Cream flavor is in my top 3 all time favorite protein flavors, tastes great, mixes well, and again is a great bang for the Buck!!! Always one of the first i recommend to my friends and family!\n",
      "The protein powder is similar to the competitors out there, but the cinnamon bun flavor does not taste like a cinnamon bun to me at all. It leaves you with a cinnamon aftertaste, but is like a weak vanilla during. Not my cup of tea, but overall you get what you pay for. 5 out of 7.\n",
      "Taste is great,  want to keep drinking as opposed to chugging, a couple of shakes and it's completely mixed. Have only tried Cookies & Cream so far but will be ordering this product again. Will try a different flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great tasting protein powder, mixes well (trust me I have used cheap powders). Use it daily after working out and mix it with my greens supplement. I choose vanilla because I can add many things to it to flavor it if I want and this one tastes great.\n",
      "I never write reviews on here but for this protein i had to. This stuff is great if youre looking for a protein on a budget, hell even if youre not on a budget its a good protein to get to save some extra bucks. I know a lot of people on here go by the flavor which yes i good to review but as far as dealing with the product as  a whole i very rarely see. Here is what i have to say about this and the reasons why i gave this a ten. The flavor is awesome. At first thought it was gonna be too sweet but it is very good, sweet but not overly sweet. Definitely makes you want to keep drinking it instead of chugging it. It mixes very very well, has no clumps at all, not thick like some other proteins but not overly thin where the taste lacks. Theres even cookie bits in it! Now onto the protein itself. At first i thought this was just a whey concentrate but i decided to look and theres concentrate, isolate and partially hydrolyzed whey. Three different rates of digesting. Also the benefit of the isolate and the partially hydrolyzed is that its already broken down for the rapid absorption that it doesnt leave you feeling bloated to where you cant eat your next meal as probably many of us have found out with other types. All in all i will probably be sticking with this for a while. Would like to see other flavors come out (coffee please) but either way a really well rounded protein that wont bust your gut or wallet. \n",
      "I've tried two favors so far, Vanilla and Cinnamon Bun and both are excellent. I would give the nod to Vanilla because it's not as sweet tasting as the Cinnamon Bun flavor.  I mix mine with Silk milk which makes it taste even better.  Ive been using this product for six months now, with my workouts and diet, I've lost 25lbs and gained muscle.  I can't recommend this product enough.  It's inexpensive and is just as good as the top brands.\n",
      "This should be one of the highest selling products from BB. This is been my preferred protein power for over a year. I just wanted a clean low carb protein powder to help me supplement a fat loss diet. I have use others protein powder products that combine with other supplements like Creatine when I have been in the bulking mode. But if you are in a weight loss and/or fat loss goal, I highly recommend this product. The best part, it taste good. I always look forward for a little pit stop for some protein shake with this product.\n",
      "After trying this product out, I'm not sure why I was hesitant to get it in the first place.  Cinnamon Bun is my new favorite flavor for protein powders, and this one blends so smooth without any aftertaste.  I will definitely be getting another one of these when I start to run low.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my new favorite protein! Its great quality and affordable. Ive seen great results since switching over. The cinnamon bun tastes just like a cinnabon when mixed with milk. However the chocolate has more of a chemical taste. Looking forward to trying the other flavors soon. \n",
      "This stuff is absolutely amazing! The chocolate I feel is even better than ON extreme chocolate, I use s blender bottle and it only takes a few shakes to be fully mixed and that's it! This is my new go to, can not beat the price!\n",
      "I rated this an 8 mainly due to taste.  I know, taste isn't everything, but its like a movie, you kind of remember the beginning but you definitely remember the end.  The vanilla flavor is sweet at first and then it hits you with an aftertaste that makes you think you drank baby formula or something.  Blech!.   \n",
      "As for the protein itself, it dissolves very well, no clumps, very smooth.  The protein levels and calories per serving are very good.  Id say its just a step down from optimum nutrition and that's because of taste and ON has less calories.  \n",
      "Id buy it again, but a different flavor.  \n",
      "So far so good. Once my body started cycling this protein my recovery speed enhanced dramatically. Tastes great and does the job. Excellent product. I don't have a whole lot of experience with different peotein powders but this certainly is doing the trick. \n",
      "The Cinnamon Bun flavor tastes fantastic, mixes so easily and at this price how can you not love it.  I admit that I am a Cellucore and Dymatize protein fan but I have had this BB.com brand for two days in a row now and am LOVING it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Per serving this is one of the lowest cost proteins out there and the quality is top notch.  You won't be disappointed with cinnamon bun flavor either.\n",
      "Vanilla is awesome !!It will mix with anything ,it is light and ,easy to digest .I will tell everyone that this is one of the best i have brought and will all-ways by\n",
      "\n",
      "Great taste, mixes well overall a great product. I highly recommend these products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is very good, mixes well but sometimes leaves small clumps.  I don't use a blender or a shaker bottle and just mix it in  my mixing bottle.  The only reason I am giving it a low 7 is due to the ingredients in it.  I did not look hard enough when I ordered it and it contains soy, which any man knows is a testosterone enemy.  If I would have known that, I would not have placed the order, but it's my fault.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a solid product if soy and some artificial ingredients don't bother you.  \n",
      "I think Body Building 100% Whey protein powder is an excellent supplement.  It as a good taste to it, Doesn't mix bad and for the price I know I will be buying more of this product in the future.  It also goes great with Body Building's pharmaceutical blend micronized creatine and glutamine.  Taken in conjunction with a moderately intense work out it really does it's job in the recovery process.  #RECOMENDIT# Excellent product folks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great flavor and mix's extremely well. Would defiantly recommend to some one short on cash or on a tight budget but still want a good quality protein blend that wont break the bank. Defiantly in my top five for flavor and affordability. \n",
      "Very Good price compared to other better brands. I use this protein as meal supporter and in between meals. Really good flavor, really good texture, and really good brand. Simply a good option to keep protein levels stable day round.\n",
      "This protein was a great price and it was a great tasting protein. I was surprised to be honest but i love it.\n",
      "No frills, great price.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely being added to my routinely purchased supplements!  The taste is great, it mixes really well, and the price is perfect.  It's replaced a name brand product on my shelf!\n",
      "Great stuff and fair price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an extremely great value for the money. Its not the purest or the absolute best whey protein powder on the market, but it is still very good, especially for what you are paying. I got the cookies and cream flavour and I must say it is pretty delicious. There are better tasting options on the market, but at this price you'd be hard pressed to find something that tastes this excellent and delivers as well. I'd definitely recommend this if you are on a budget and trying to find a quality source of whey protein. One tiny complaint I have is that the measuring cup was buried halfway down in the powder. I a little bit of a nuisance to get to, but not a biggie. \n",
      "I've tried a lot of Protein powdersb and NOTHING compares when it comes to Flavor!!! With my comp coming up shortly, I don't crave anything sweet because this gives me my fix.\n",
      "Mixes well and taste good even just mixing it with water. I'll be a buyer of this  product again especially at this price. \n",
      "Great taste! Great Mix, Great price, not full of too much garbage you don't really need in your protein. I am a satisfied customer!\n",
      "loved this stuff.  protein powders all do about the same for me, so i really enjoy the good price.  i've ordered this several times, along with a few other products - the biggest + for me was that my last 3 orders arrived the next day, even though i had picked standard shipping.\n",
      "Taste and texture-wise, I prefer this whey over Protogen. That being out of the way, The amino acid profile is decent and it sits very well in my stomach.. I can tell I'm not ingesting garbage lol. Will probably buy again when I run out. Try blending cookies n creme with some peanut butter and milk..oats if you like chewing...AMAZING\n",
      "This tastes amazing...much better than I thought.  I hear folks complain about how poorly their other brands taste and I just chuckle and steer them to this stuff.  I also love the fact that it is low everything, especially if you are slim down your fat and watch your calorie/crap intake.\n",
      "This was a yummy chocolate. Sometimes I would mix with coconut milk and it would be like a candy bar drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great price and taste. mixes well. \n",
      "Mixes well, and good taste.. works really well in homemade protein bars!\n",
      "Excellent flavor. \n",
      "Good taste. Good result. Mixes excellent.\n",
      "This stuff tastes disgusting! I have tried a number of other Whey products and this is by far the worst. Also, the scoop seems a bit large, which makes me believe that there is a lot of filler in the product. I will never buy this product again.\n",
      "This is actually way better than I expected. The taste is pretty good and it mixes very well with water. For the price and the nurticional value, I would definitely order again.\n",
      "\n",
      "BEST mixing of any protein I have ever purchased. Great price point. I mixed this with almond milk, fat free milk and used it in smoothes. I'd love a chocolate mint flavor wink wink nudge nudge. I will purchase this again when this supply runs up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes good even with water. Does what it needs to do for a good price.\n",
      "Tastes great, mixes easily. Great product.\n",
      "Just finished my first 1.8 kilo of this product, overall it was solid protein for the price, it gets the job done, tastes great, and it dissolves easily. Also comes with the added bonus of low cals and carbs which was a great to have on the diet.\n",
      "Excellent product, mixes well with both casein and creatine. I use it in the morning, then a shake with casein in the evening and of course right after a good hard work out.\n",
      "I mix this with my casien protein, creatine, and skim milk and works really good. I mix with the same brand and flavor of whey and mixes fairly well and taste fairly consistent. \n",
      "Great product for the cost\n",
      "Best mixing whey ive ever tried,taste awesome.will deffinetly be buying again\n",
      "Mixes well, and vanilla tastes very sweet. Great protein for the price\n",
      "Not the best protein Iv ever had but if your on a budget it will certainly get the job done and tastes better than any Walmart protein\n",
      "I just got a tub of the cookies and cream flavor a few days ago and I have to admit I was very surprised.  The taste in milk is amazing and it mixes very well.  Havent noticed any clumping or bad settling after mixing in milk either.  Very affordable as well.  Great product for the price.  Will definetly order more once Im done with this one.  Also have tried chocolate as well, also taste/mixes great.\n",
      "Taste great, mixes well\n",
      "I personally really like this protein shake and prefer it over \"better\" more expensive powders.\n",
      "I've only tried the chocolate flavor and I really enjoyed it.\n",
      "The granules are very small and fine which make mix-ability effortless. After a good arm day, the last think you want do is a \"shake weight\"...\n",
      "Also, because it is a lighter powder it is also a lighter drink. I hate and physically can't stomach a thick, heavy meal replacement/ protein shake. I like to just pound it down and be done with it. I only use 8 oz of water and it's still very fluid.\n",
      "I overall think this is one of, if not the, best whey protein powders you can get for the price. Highly recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "This thing taste amazing! and the recovery rate that gives me after a long workout are noticeable.\n",

      "easy to digest and it blends really fast and easy. As far as adding weight, did not really so no major factor in that area but that could of been because of me. overall a great product/ \n",
      "This is the only WHEY protein powder that make me feel just good, I suffer bloating problem with whey, casein or other types of protein less egg, and this one is the best ever!!!  I mix my oat bran with eggs whites cooked them, and finally add the chocolate protein powder and it is freaking delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So the flavor isnt too bad really but then again nothing super ether. Ive been taking this for a few weeks now and havnt really noticed too much change in my body but i dont blame the item for this at all. its a good value,esp if you are new and just starting out,unsure if you wanna spend lots of money.  All in all this is  a sold product that I just might use again!\n",
      "Great taste and excellent value!  Bring back the 10lb bag!!!!!  I found out the other day through customer service that it's been discontinued???  \n",
      "Great taste\n",

      "\n",
      "Up there with the best chocolate I have tasted, mixes fairly well and cannot be beaten for the price! All positives :)\n",
      "I really liked the chocolate flavor. The first 5 days ways kinda heavy on my stomach, but then i get used to it. Good value, i would definitely buy it again, but im experimenting different proteins now\n",
      "I was hesitant in ordering this since it was so cheap (10 pounds for $79.98) and especially after reading some bad reviews about vanilla's taste, but I am very happy with my purchase and am quite satisfied with the flavor.  It mixes very well with other flavors and tastes good on its own, also dissolves pretty quickly and doesn't clump up either.\n",
      "Love this! The Cookies and Cream tastes exactly like a Hershey's chocolate bar so it satisfies my potent sweet tooth (ugh), its my first time buying protein and I definitely like this one so far. High protein, and fills you up, i wasn't hungry for quite a while afterward. I like the whey this makes me feel :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the taste, the mixability, the grams of protein per serving, and value.\n",
      "Overall, the best buy for bulk protein. Comparable to ONWGS, but whey cheaper. A staple for bodybuilding on a budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply does not taste good (stay away from vanilla, I haven't had the other ones) but it doesn't cost much if that's what you're looking for. Mix is decent. I have not clue how it has as high of a rating as it does. But it's the cheapest option I found for a 10 lb. bag\n",
      "This is great stuff, and affordable!  I use a full scoop right after I work out, and also use half a scoop plus half a scoop of casein with breakfast for a mix of fast-acting and slow-digesting protein.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes very easily, and good flavor, although for variety I sometimes add instant coffee.\n",
      "As far as price, flavor, protein content, and great amino profile, you just can't beat Bodybuilding.com's 100% Whey Power.

      "great protein powder\n",
      "IT OK  I LIKE IT \n",
      "Excellent tasting whey protein, and it mixes in very easily. Whenever I get tired of buying cheaper whey proteins, and I need a good pick me up its the cookies and cream all the way!\n",
      "An excellent protein; both in regards to taste and value.  The protein is regularly offered for $80 for 10 lbs as compared to in store prices where I regularly paid $60 for 2.2 lbs to ensure quality.  No to mention it is delicious, easy to dissolve, and low carb/sodium.  I would highly recommend this product to committed athletes who are tired of being duped out of their paychecks but want to reach the next level.\n",
      "Good product . I got a good bit of gain's while using this product it mixes good taste's good i used this product in making some food and it had a good taste i really love this product it is a good deal but recently i have been trying to stay away from soy so i am trying outher product's but this product is still great i have shared it with 3 or 4 outher's and they all liked it aswell \n",
      "BTW . I always mixed it with water i never tried milk but i am pretty sure with milk it would be even more flavor full \n",
      "It's not the best of the best, but it sure does the job. Taste is great!! Both Chocolate and Vanilla.. \n",
      "My husband ordered this product without me realizing it.  I made a shake after one of my workouts.  Instantly I realized that something was different about it as I ch****ed down the shake a lot faster than usual.  I asked him if we got a new brand.  He told me, \"No, actually, Bodybuilding remade the taste, improved their product!\"  They sure did!!!!  I'm about to order MORE!!\n",
      "great product\n",
      "\n",
      "I was skeptical at first because it is the \"off brand\" and I see all the other brands of proteins advertised and glorified...however after one serving of this stuff I was amazed....I have tried a lot of brands.. name brands of proteins, but this is by far my favorite! The flavor is excellent, I look forward to drinking the shake instead of just doing it because I have to. And the results are optimal as well.. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants the best bang for your buck! (p.s. I really like to use between half a scoop to a whole scoop depending on my daily needs of they chocolate whey and the same amount of cookies and cream casein.. wow talk about delicious! I didn't know a protein shake could be so yummy!)\n",

      "Again, like my review of ElitePro Fusion, this stuff is exactly like it - it is NOT meant for real creamy-smooth shakes.  Too little ice, and you get half icee, half liquid.  Too much ice, and it doesn't blend smooth no matter how long you blend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are the type that simply puts it in a shaker cup and consumes it that way, it'll work.  However, if you prefer rich, meal-like protein shakes, use MyoFusion which can be frothed-up into an incredibly velvety smoothie.\n",

      "I used to go to GNC all the time and buy their expensive protein, and my friend showed me bodybuilding and I found Whey Power Cookies and Cream and it's by far the best tasting protein I've ever tasted. And it has 25 grams of protein and 5 grams of BCAAs. If you're tired of buying expensive protein give this a try and you won't be disappointed.\n",

      "This protein is weird. Some days it tastes amazing (exactly like a chocolate milkshake) while some days it tastes absolutely horrible and makes me gag. I don't know what the deal is with it but I will definitely not be buying it again (at least not this flavor.) \n",

      " 1- Unlike ON's HydroWhey, you can't just heap as much as you want into your mixer and expect it to blend and taste good. Going much above 1 scoop with a large mixer of milk results in some mild/moderate clumping and quite a sour taste. That being said, when I mix 1 scoop of this with 1 scoop of ON's Casein it tastes good, blends as well as something containing casein will ever blend, and actually does a decent job masking the casein.\n",
      "Awesome protein, was surprised when I drank this and I now ordered 8lbs of it best tasting love it \n",
      "This is a great product. The taste is sensational, and the powder tastes good in water, not only in milk (which I use 99% of the time). I would not recommend stirring the product to mix it though because it clumps worse than any other protein I have purchased. However, if you shake it or blend it you should never have problems with it. Plus it is hard to beat this product for price. Please note that if you buy the 10lb variety, the product comes in a bag, not a container which would have been good to know (I probably should have figured this though). Great stuff!\n",
      "This is the best tasting protein shake I have EVER tried and I only use water to mix it with. It also has BCAA's, which is a plus. It doesn't have the chalky taste/feel that I've noticed with other powders. Plus it mixes very well. I definitely recommend this.\n",
      "This is the only protein I have ever consumed that gave me stomach cramps.  Not sure what kind of crap they're putting in here now...corn syrup solids?  This isn't even the same product that I ordered yet BB.com shipped out this inferior product that has been causing me GI problems for a month instead.\n",

      "This has a great price point and the amount of protein is good, BUT: it's so cloyingly sweet I could hardly get 8 oz. down. If you could drop about half the sugar it would be awsome. I will say that the general taste was terrific--like a good vanilla ice cream. Very rich. Might be good for a 'dessert' shake. It does mix very well, too.\n",

I have been with a soar thoat for two weeks now becuase of this product. In addition my  left side of my stomach started hurting. i would get sharp burning pains. I had to stop taking my multi vitamis, creatine, and fish oil to determine what was causing this problem. I stopped taking the product for a week now, and the pain is gone. I wasnt even able to finish the product. Overal poor quality, and a waste of money. The price is good, but be aware of the quality of the product.\n",

      "Do not buy the changed recipe.  It boasts of an improved flavor and improved \"mixability\" but has neither.  It also boasts of \"more protein\" but that is only because the scoop size has increased.  Unsurprisingly, the calories have also gone up with this scoop size and other reviews say the sugar content has gone up, but I can't verify that.  This protein used to be affordable and great; the new recipe has changed that.  \n",
      "Great whey protein with cometitive price.\n",
      "I bought this product when it was on clearance. My protein tub came with 10 Lemon lime pre-workouts and some other free samples. The taste is really good initially; but it leaves a horrible metallic taste shortly after. Base on the reviews from other people, it seems as if there isn't a problem with the taste. I'd recommend this only if its on clearance.\n",
      "Seems to be working pretty well so far and I have only had it for a few days. Taste is amazing when mixed with milk.\n",
      "VERY DISAPPOINTING. The Cookies and Cream tastes great, but I don't like the direction BB.com is going. The \"New Formula\" means 1) more carbs and 2) more sugar per scoop. Also, they are using advertising like \"More Protein!\", when the protein comes with a bigger scoop than previously (36g compared to 31g). Of course it has more protein, it's a larger serving!\n",

      "This is seriously the best-tasting whey protein powder I've tried (cookies and cream flavor).  I have tried numerous others (other brands) and they all had the same obnoxiously chalky, gross after taste. You would have to take it in one chug or suffer. Ha.  \n",

I haven't had it in milk yet, but in water its pretty sweet and tastes fine to me. Don't get me wrong, its no myofusion or syntha 6 taste-wise but for the price I'd definitely recommend it. \n",

I use this for the BCAAs and protein:carb ratio for post workout. It tastes great, mixes well and goes down perfectly! It has 23g of protein so if I feel I need more, I just add the pure protein I get on ebay to it.\n",
      "I've got to the point where protein is protein, and I'm consuming so much of that I can't be bothered with marketing, I just need what's cheapest. This stuff takes great, mixes great, and does the job. What more else do you need?\n",
      "Seems like a good protein for the price. Alot cheaper than ON. Mixes ok an taste Isnt too bad either. Just ordered the Isolate gonna try It out.\n",
      "Taste is good, but aftertaste is not so good, and after 1 week aftertase is killing me.\n",
      "taste is good, Belds easy in my shaker bottle. Only dislike was I order 10 pounds and it came in a BIG BAG not a bin.. hah Other then that cheap good protein.\n",
      "It's affordable, mixes well, and tastes great compared to other proteins. Very nice.\n",
      "The flavor is just delicious and I been using it for a year now and has helped me build muscle. I mix it in the blender with almond milk and blueberries and it just tastes amazing. I'm a teacher, so I really struggle with eating every two hours since I have to be in the classroom until we go to lunch, so if I get hungry I just drink my shake and I'm set until I can take a break. Then I drink another one in the evening after working out. I highly recommend it!\n",
      "The price is what drew me into this product. A little cheaper than Optimum Nutrition, but I decided to give this a shot. Upon opening the container the smell of inviting brownie mix filled my nose. The measuring cup is kind of wide, but that's beside the point. Mix-ability was superb, maybe 4-5 shakes at minimum with the blender ball. And the taste, last but not least is quite delicious. Kind of a mix between EAS and ON products. The nutritional profile is great. Low calories, high BCAA's. But if there was one thing I can say keeps it from being a perfect is that it's 23 grams of protein per scoop. Still a **** good buy, I will be buying more of this product. \n",
      "Got a 10-serving tub of this to try it, and I have to say I'm impressed. The nutritional numbers on the label look good. The taste is a little better than expected, but not great. Taste is comparable to Combat powder (in water), not as good as Myofusion. However, with the money I can save buying this 10lbs at a time, I will be switching when I run out of my current stock. So far so good with the new BB.com line.\n",
      "This is pretty good for the money. You get a lot of servings versus the other companies. I chose the vanilla flavor. It tasted pretty darn good. Helps me recover fast. I attend the gym 5-6 days of the week. The only complaint I have is that in the blender is mixes well, but in the shaker bottle it gets a little clumpy sometimes. Overall I would buy it again and again. Although when I first bought this product it was $39.... now its $45!?? come on BB make up your mind with the prices. If it does go up more ill stick with muscle pharm.\n",
      "As far as recovery goes, I see no reason to spend extra money on ON or other brands. But it needs to be a bit more chocolatey, but I would really appreciate it if they made cookies and cream in the 10lb bags!\n",
      "I love this product, the chocolate flavor isn't too sweet and a definitely isn't bland. Definitely on par with the very best tasting Whey Protein's I've tried. Love it, especially for the price.\n",

      "Taste is good for cookies and cream, mixes well. quality protein for the price\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "im only half way done with the tub i take 2 scoops post workout. as an individual that really cares about results over taste i dont mind this product at all. i went from 170 to 185 within a month prlly because i added mico-creatine and glutamine with the product. i got this when it was cheaper but i prlly wont be getting it again due to higher price i would again if they drop it. i recommend 100% whey from ON over this. but right now im satisfied with my results. nothing much to complain about.\n",
      "Best protein powder out there, i was one of those guys who tried all the big brand powders but this stuff is the best tasting and best performing powder i have used and for 2/3 the price of the big brand stuff, you cant beet it!\n",
      "Chocolate tastes better than Optimum 100% whey double chocolate and extreme chocolate. I bought it to save the $8 and it was worth it. Only complaint is that it doesnt mix super well but it is definitely not worth wasting 8 more dollars so that you cant see chunks.\n",
      "The smell of the powder when you first open the contain makes you think that it is a bad batch. The taste is about the same as the dry powder smell ... nothing to get excited about. It does mix well and is thicker (when mixed with milk) than other whey protein powders. Plus, it is priced well ... but you get what you pay for I suppose. I can put up with the smell and the taste if the price stays lower than the competitors.\n",
      "Cookies and cream protein is the best protein i have ever tasted - wanted to drink it all day, don't feel like sugar or anything as this tastes like a treat! Would reccomend to anyone - I am very fussy with proteins and loved this\n",
      "Great protein. Quality stuff, mixes well, tastes great. And an awesome price.\n",
      "Bought this instead of Optimum Gold Standard to save a few bucks and I'm regretting every second of it. Taste is horrible and I question the quality as well. Never again...go with Gold Standard and pay the extra $.\n",
      "Overall, this was a pretty good protein. Making a cookies &amp;amp; cream flavored whey is hard to make taste like an oreo, but I think that they came pretty close. It had pretty good taste and mixed really well. Price was definately a selling point for me, much cheaper than other brands.\n",
      "mixes easy and taste is nice. not to strong chocolate flavour nice.\n",
      "When I bought my first batch of this it was 39.99. I planned to continue to use this protein at that price because from what I see it is fine. With the raise in price do not buy this product. It isn't as good tasting or as good overall as Optimum Goldstandard, Myofusion, or Syntha-6. Wouldn't recommend at the new price that's why I give it a 1.\n",
      " May or may not buy again\n",
      "I have been a user of Higher Power whey protein since '04. Back then, you could get 5lbs for around $20.00. I cannot believe the price keeps on going up and the number of servings per container has gone from 81 to 73. If this trend continues I will have to look elsewhere.\n",
      " HELLO! WE AREN'T MAKING ANY MORE MONEY\n",
      "When it comes to whey protein, I am a firm believer that protein is protein. I don't care if the package says concentrate or isolate. As long as I hit my protein macros, I don't care. Therefore, when I chose my protein, I decide based on TASTE. Bodybuilding.com's new brand is the best tasting protein I've ever tasted, and I've used a LOT of different brands. Even with water, it tastes better than Dymatize Elite Gourmet used with milk! And at 25g of protein per scoop, I am sold!! Excellent dissolveability. 10/10.\n",
      "Not only does this taste great and blow muscle milk's cookies n cream out of the water but it also works great. The first time I tried bodybuilding.com whey protein was after a hard workout. The next day it felt like I never even went to the gym. My whole body felt great!\n",
      "Takes a little longer to mix, but the vanilla tastes great! The ingredient list seems to cover all the main protein needs you see in other brands. The scoop that comes with it is larger than most protein powders I've used.\n",
      "I love this protein powder! The taste (Chocolate) is really really good. I defiantly recommend this protein powder.\n",
      " It should be noted, however, that the BB.com whey line currently has 25% of your daily value of cholesterol per scoop. While the anabolic effects of cholesterol and testosterone production are documented, I would suggest that anybody taking more than 2 scoops per day or not eating a clean diet outside of supplementation find a low cholesterol whey powder and blend them.\n",
      "I bought this not only because of price, but also a lower calories. Strawberry taste awesome especially when mixed with a little apple juice. It mixes better than most, no clumps. I will be purchasing this product again, and again.\n",
      "Great stuff taste pretty good not the best but far from the worse,Price is right. It has a good amino blend,I will Buy again.\n",
      " Hopefully, the other BB.com flavors are better.\n",

      "Dissolves great in everything I mix it with. Gives me the extra edge to finish a hard workout.\n",
      "Can't live without this stuff!  I add this to my pre-workouts because I only do a minimum dose on those typically due to the caffeine (I don't like a lot).  Taking only 1 scoop of pre-workouts reduces my dose of beta-alanine though, so I spike it with a half scoop of this for just the right amount of buzz.  Been using this for almost 2 years and it does exactly what I need.\n",
      "\n",
      "100% pure BA! No side orders of cellulose or anything else, awesome. I have been using this for about 3 years and have tried a few others but always come back to this. Can't say enough good things, it has been a staple to my pre-workout and have continuously improved performance and the quality of this product has been a factor in achieving that.\n",
      "Scoop is actually 1.5-1.8g. One scoop does not weigh out to a full serving. But the mix ability is really good, just give it a shake before each sip. Not a big deal. There are cheaper ways to get carnosyn beta alanine though, but good product. \n",
      "Hi,\n",
      "I`m using this product for my CF training. Beta Alanine is a part of my Pre-workout set of supplements. Along with some creatine and NO3 boosters it drives me \"crazy\" to hit the barbells with the biggest weights and do the heaviest exercises possible. Good extra power source even after a set of heavy days I can go on with the schedule. No taste at all, I mix it with the NO3 formula I prefer and have them both working at the same time. Works very well.\n",

      "It does exactly what it's suppose to do..\n",
      "Helped increase my endurance and focus during workouts, gives a body flush when kicking in.\n",
      "I add a scoop to my preworkout Iron Pump, as it doesnt contain any beta in it.  The first day taking it was great. No tingles or anything, but a good focus.  I try not to take it everyday, because I tend to get used to products quickly and don't notice the effects. But good product overall.\n",
      "Excellent. I take it pre workout with Creavar and it mixes like a dream. About 5 minutes into my workout I get a light flush (similar to Niacin but very light) and then the energy spikes. I have been able to get extra sets in and be energized all day since taking this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product, will definitely be buying again. The price is great and 75 plus servings, cant go wrong!\n",
      "I bought this some time ago when I was going on a caffeine break (therefore not taking caffeinated pre-workouts), but was still looking to get the endurance increasing effects of a pre-workout. It is definitely the most cost effective beta-alanine supplement that I could find, and it mixes with pretty much anything. Big fan of this stuff.\n",
      "Great product. I feel this product is dose consistent with the what the research backs. I appreciate BB.com providing a cost effective supplement I will continue to buy it. My fatigue threshold has improved and I plan to continue to use this supplement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw Beta Alanine, and read some about it, for a while before trying it.  Recently I purchased BB.com's 75 serving, unflavored, size container of the product.  I like it!  I take it about 15-30 minutes prior to my workout and notice a slight tingling after about 10-15 minutes, primarily in my face and upper body areas.  This tingling is similar to that experienced when I have taken niacin only much milder.  In short I could feel it doing something, which is more than I can say for other supplements.   I feel it definitely enhances my physical performance during my workouts.  I don't feel it is just a placebo effect either since I have been able to add reps and/or weight to my recent workout exercises!  And I personally appreciate the fact that BB.Com puts no other added ingredients into this product, in order to charge more for the product itself.  It is unflavored, which it should be I feel, since I am interested in progress not satisfying a sweet tooth.  I recommend the product without reservation. \n",
      "Does the job, mixes easily, and no taste difference when adding to other supplements. Will definitely buy again.\n",

      "NCAA Division 1 sprinter (100m, 200m). Every 200m race that I took beta alanine before, I ran a mid to low 21 second 200m. When I didn't take it, my times were not as quick. There were probably other factors at play too, but  for me, there was a strong correlation between beta alanine and fast 200m times. \n",
      "This stuff works. cheaper than buying pre workouts packed with fillers and under dosed amounts of creatine that i buy separately anyways. It gives the tingles that are common with beta alanine. \n",
      "I really like having my beta-alanine separate from my pre-workout. I can add more if I'm running, less if I'm lifting. Beta alanine is great because you can FEEL it work. Bodybuilding's beta-alanine dissolves well and doesn't really have it's own taste. I'll be buying it again!\n",
      "Good product...good price...you know it's beta alanine when you can feel it in your skin. I drink it with my pre workout drink and once I feel that \"itch\" I'm ready to blast into my workout.\n",
      "Just bought beta alanine after having read many positive reviews, and given the low price compared to other pre-workout products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if I didn't feel much tingles in my body, the product gave me much pump and after one hour I felt I could still go on training. I mixed it with creatine and worked nicely, it's for sure a good and cheap alternative that I will most likely keep purchasing. A flavor wouldn't be bad though.\n",
      "Beta-Alanine is really amazing in that it allows me to have a much more intense overall workout.  I am able to go harder, faster, and longer because of Beta-Alanine.  I can definitely notice a difference in my workouts when I do not take it prior to working out.  I feel as if I don't not have as much wind as I do when I take it.  It has become an essential supplement in my resistance and cardio training.\n",

      "It help me work harder even without needing caffeine.  I can workout a lot longer too.  Great stuff!\n",
      "If you didn't know already, beta alanine is used to help with muscle fatigue. This means, your muscles are go that extra length which will result in a efficient workout! Good stuff! This is one of the top 3 ingredients for a preworkout! Would highly s****est supplementing this baby!\n",
      "Really great stuff, any time you want those tingles just through some of this in your preWO! Cheap too!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great price, good tingles, what more can you ask for. Oh yeah, it works too. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know more and more pre workout supps have this in it, but I lately I have just been taking 200mg of caffeine, Amino X from BSN, and mix in 2 scoops or 6 grams of beta alanine.  I'm not jittery, but my focus is absolutely outstanding, my energy levels are great where I'm not jittery but I'm ready to lift and lift heavy.  Lastly, I've either been doing Xfit workouts or xfit style workouts where its maybe a 10 or 20 second rest in between sets of more full body movements.  Since I'm started taking 6 grams I truly can say my endurance to get thru these intense workouts has really increased.  Yes, my endurance just from doing this style of workouts has increased from conditioning, but I I've tried not taking it before hand I had that short circuited feel when I got deep into the workout.  6 grams works for me, find a dose that works for you and I'm quite sure you will be happy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people speakof a tingling feeling they get from it. I however have never felt it. The product works pretty decent considering i only take it monday through Friday right before my workouts so i never really give it enough time to build up in my system. I just recently finished a 30 pound cutting phase where i used no supplements so i lost some strength but after 3weeks of taking this Beta alanine along with several casein protein shakes throughtout the day I have all my strentgh back and some. Dont expect any drastic difference to be noticed immediately it just gradually increases ur performance over time.\n",
      "Helps my workouts last longer!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the \"itchy\" as my girlfriend calls it. Good price for a good amount of servings, i just wished it mixed just slightly better, a little grainy on the side of my shaker. \n",
      "I read an article about this product for being a pre workout supplement without all the fillers and flavor's so I had to try it, and it works and the price is nice also. I will be buying more.\n",
      "Started using this as an added edge after reading about supplements. I trust it is working in conjunction with Pre-Gym and AminoX. Some of the supps I take all ready have some in it so this lasts and lasts!\n",
      "the products of BB being famous, they are good...\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoy the tingle unlike some others.  Product works great at a very reasonable price.  I stack it with bb.com creatine.  Kinda has a lemon like taste I dont mind not very strong.\n",
      "As far as mixability goes, this is the best Beta Alanine powder I've tried. It's easy to measure, and it dissolves readily, no chalkiness, grit, or discernible taste. Because of this, I just put a scoop in with my protein powder. Simple. So far it seems to work as well as any other brand I've tried.\n",
      "I have been taking this for a few weeks now.  I use it to make my own pre-workout mix.  This is deffinately worth the money.  \n",
      "It doesn't get much cheaper than this and it's great for pumps and endurance.\n",
      "Awesome product! Does exactly what beta alanine is supposed to do, and definitely delivers the \"tingly\" feeling! Great product and great price! \n",
      "Works very well, gives me a good pump at the gym and you can't beat the price.\n",
      "Great option for pre- work out supplement for those trying to avoid caffeine. \n",
      "Guys this is quality Beta Alanine. I was unsure about it until I tried it. It has the same effect as other beta alanines I have tried except I get more out of this for less money. The scooper is tiny and one serving is plenty enough to get me tingling and help me push out more reps.\n",
      "Also, some unflavored supps as we know are really bad when mixed with water.\n",
      "This however, is really good. I just mixed some with plain water for the first time and it tasted like I added a spritz of lemon juice. Easy to knock back or put in with a customized preworkout drink.\n",
      "I think this is really the best option if you want beta on its own without fillers or bullsht. \n",
      "Mixes pretty well, best results when I mixed it with my pre workout. It kinda of enhances the tingly feeling from it.\n",
      "I don't have a lot of experience with pre-workouts. I have previously only used Hemo-Rage, Craze, and Mesomorph.  So when I ran out of Craze (which has since been banned in Australia, i decided to try something new. Unfortunately, this did not meet my expectations. Although I did get the skin tingling, I didn't get any form of energy boost, or any increased focus. Needless to say, I won't be buying this again. I definitely believe that pre-workouts affect individuals differently. BodyBuilding.com's Beta Alanine and I just don't work well together. Maybe I'll try C4 next time.\n",
      "I love Beta- Alanine. It's a solid supplement to add to a stack. It helps with soreness, and DOMS big time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whats great about this specific BB.com Brand line of product is that it is pure, gives you only the product, nothing added.  So great, and you get a solid amount per serving. Not to mention it's cheap as hell, and it lasts a while, so it's AWESOME!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Buy this stuff!!!\n",
      "Excellent product and helped my a lot, great price for Carnosyn®, I've seen noticeable results with it, and love the tingly feeling it gives me with every workout. For me Beta Alanine is essential in my stack with whey protein and Creatine, definitely would buy it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read a article and it said that the amount to use depends on your weight. so I played around with it until I found a mix that works for me. I use half a scoop of bata alanine and half a scoop of assault. I weigh 185 pounds and this mix works for me. Also I feel a pump that I did not before. This week I pressed 225lb and I think this mix had a big part int it. I really recommend it.\n",
      "After taking for a few weeks, didn't really notice much difference, maybe a little less muscle burn during leg day squat/leg press day. I started forgetting to mix my daily cocktail, which included 3.2g beta-alanine, and noticed increased muscle burn. For the current price (and effectively 60 days worth after initial load - I took 2 scoops for first 5 days), I'd say this is worth having in your stack, alongside a good creatine and glutamine.\n",
      "Started adding it to my pre workout concoction after reading what Jim Stoppani had to say about it. Beta Alanine really helps get through some of those higher rep days and bodybuilding.com is super enough to sell 75 servings of 3.2 grams so cheap at around $18. Completely tasteless as well.\n",
      "It's beta-alanine. helps me workout longer, gives me the tingle (which i like), I had a boost to every PWO and a bit to every shake.\n",
      "All i can say is WOW.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took this product with con cret, and ive never had a better workout performance in my life. I felt like i could have done my entire workout again after finishing it that first day. I definitely can tell a difference in taking it pre workout and not taking it pre workout.\n",
      "Awesome stuff, i cant handle much pre workouts but this i could tolerate. Gives a good pump and im seeing results from it, worth a try \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This supplement is awesome! When I first discovered Beta Alanine and all of the great effects it had, I had to order some because certain pre-workouts had little to none. If you have a low tolerance to Beta Alanine, you'll feel it within minutes after taking it, mainly in your face and arms. The taste surprised me. Although it's unflavored, it's really a weird taste in just water. It's not very potent which is nice. I usually combine one full scoop (3.2g) with two scoops of C4, and this stuff is awesome.\n",
      "felt a difference taking this, love the tingles!\n",
      "This product is pretty awesome.  I would recommend that you mix it with something other than water.  I mix mine with coffee in the mornings as a pre-workout.  \n",
      "I chose to go the cheaper route for my pre-workout because jack3d wasn't in my price range when I ordered this product. Going the cheaper route I realized wasn't the best idea. Most of the times I took this product I had a tingling sensation all over my body, almost like pins and needles, on my nose, my ears, my shoulders. I did feel energized, but it was quite distracting to lift while feeling like that, so I would have to go onto the treadmill and walk it off for about 10 minutes. Eventually the tingles went away and I did feel energized but didn't like the way it made me feel. If you're desperate for a pre-workout and don't have the cash quite yet, save the few extra bucks and go with jack3d or C4. Just my advice...\n",
      "This product when I received it the warning labels stated this....Product contains chemicals known to the state of California to CAUSE Cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm. Funny to me how bodybuilding.com cut out that part out on the information about this product on the website but was on the label when I received it at home. Went straight into the garbage!! Almost looks like grindings of fibreglass and the measuring cup is the size of ur pinky finger. Wouldn't  recommend it to any body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "works immediately. mixed fast with water. seems to digest faster the similar pill form products. impressed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Excellent price for this product. Comes with a scoop which is great, as many pure beta-alanine products do not. Only downside is when you get to the end of the bottle, it is hard to get your hand in there to scoop it out because the bottle is narrow, and the scooper is short. Otherwise, excellent!\n",
      "Great product works great. But it Smells like **** thats the only bad thing but once you mix it with a Protein shake you cant taste it when i run out i will buy some more\n",
      "This stuff works great and gives my that extra edge to push through a tough workout. I just mix it in my water bottle preworkout and it it dissolves easily. I use this, along with several other supplements, to make my own preworkout drink now. With the price and number of servings, the beta alanine will definitely remain a staple in my arsenal. No more premixed preworkouts for me.\n",
      "Good price for the beta alanine\n",
      "No fishy after taste. Great for heart, brain, vision, and joint health.\n",
      "Good stuff - if you're looking at EPA/DHA per dollar this is just as cost effective as many bulk plain fish oil pills. The lemon is not over-powering, but then again I don't sit and savor it either, I just toss in my mouth and wash down with water. \n",
      "\n",
      "I try to take high doses of fish oils, so now instead of taking 8-10/day I can take 4 pills and get the same benefit. \n",
      "I take 5-6grams of fish oils a day, which is about 3-4 of the recommended servings daily. This BBcom product is a Great BANG for your BUCK! BBcoms Foundation series are seriously such Great products for very inexpensive prices!!!!\n",

      "Good fish oil. Good quality and good price. Also doesn't give me fish burps after consuming.\n",
      "I take all 3 softgels a day in one serving at 140lbs and the burps are not that bad.\n",
      "This is a awesome dosage for the price. You can't beat it. And No nasty fish burps or anything. \n",
      "Good Omega.  Did not have fish burps from this Omega as compared to others in the past.  Liked the product but switched to Omega JYM since provides higher/better ration of EPA/DHA. \n",
      "First time i got these was 3ish months ago and they were great. Rare burp would be more lemon than fish. Reordered the other day and these ones are worse. Takes hours to digest, tons of burping and all fish no lemon. I even double checked the label to see if it said Lemon... really disappointed on this 2nd batch. Joints feel good though...\n",
      "\n",
      "No fishy aftertaste. Easy to take. \n",
      "By far the best fish oil I have ever taken. I've had shoulder and knee problems and after a month of taking them regularly, my joints feel amazing. The best thing about these is the price (I got them on a buy 2 get 1 free), and the fact that there are no nasty fish burps. I did however experience a bit of nausea when I took these on an empty stomach/not with a full meal, but that's to be expected.  \n",
      "GREAT PRODUCT AND AWESOME PRICE. NO ONE CAN EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE PRICING DEALS. \n",
      "taste good, no fish burps...great product\n",
      "Ive been using this for about 2-3 weeks. Thought the price was great, amount of omega 3 per serving were good and I dont get any fishy burps or any other side effects. \n",
      "Easy to Swallow. Got fish burps a bit but tasted like lemon so I didn't mind.\n",
      "Best ratio of EPA/DHA on the market. Lemon flavoring helps with fish burps. Overall great product that will stay in my supplement stack.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall awesome product. No fish burp, just lemony burp, makes it seem like you just had a lemon candy. \n",
      "Best fish oil I've taken to date.  Zero fish burps, literally ALL others i've tried I got fish burps at least once and a while.\n",
      "Great product and the after taste its just lemon. Love it\n",
      "Great product for a great price.  Did not give me fish burps. \n",
      "Honestly have no clue how one is to measure that effectiveness of taking fish oil. I will say this product does not give the fish burps as advertised; instead lemon. Here is a another benefit, you will be thirsty while taking this. A positive side effect. down side dosage is 3 per day.\n",
      "Only knock, and it may not be the products fault but they did give me fish burps, every single day so I decided to stop. ON never gave me fish burps so I am switching back.\n",
      "Great price, you can't actually taste the lemon flavor, but I like that. And no fishy burps, awesome! \n",
      "These fish oil capsules were the only ones I could find with increased EPA-DHA at a great price. Hard to say if they've been working for me since it's only been a couple weeks, but these have become a staple in my prep. So far no complaints.\n",
      "I actually notice a difference when I take these fish oils. I highly recommend.\n",
      "Had been using MusclePharm fish oil, but gave these a try. I give one mark above average rating for the thin softgel shell, I felt they desolved quicker and easier on the stomach; and give another mark for 10 more softgels for about the same price as MP. Not giving any additional mark on the taste because these gave me fish burps, citric flavor ones. Can't tell any significant difference in terms of effectiveness. Still prefer MP better.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first Fish Oil supplement I have used and I am impressed. No fish burps with this product, only lemony ones. Reminds me of lemon candy. After taking it for 30 days, I can say that it's helped improve my mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also like that I can get a higher combined EPA + DHA amount per serving than a lot of the other brands. This is a big plus for me since I needed to take 2g of this combined amount daily.  I'm keeping this on my roster.\n",
      "I used to take a local store bought fish oil but the prices are high and i had to take 3 pills and with all the others im taking this amounts to way to many pills to swallow in a day so once i ran out i looked online and on bb.com. i compared this one to all the others and the only other that stood out was orange triad but this seemed better and i purchased it. great products seems to do the job with my sore joints and its great for my diet, 1 pill per serving is a plus and the price is decent. if i do burp and this has only happened once it was lemon but very faint to even really notice. i would go with this product if you are having trouble choosing. very dependable brand and great products all around. cant go wrong.\n",

      "I tried this one instead of musclepharms and will still to this one!Easy to take no fish burps and its a good bang for your buck!\n",
      "Bought 3 bottles of this great supplement in July. I take 3 pills/day, no after taste, and feel very well. This is surely a nice product with a great price!\n",
      "Again, so much value behind these bb.com supps.  If you're on a budget, this is the way to go.\n",
      "Great cost to EPA/DHA ratio. Plus you don't have to down 8-9 pills a day to get your recommended values of 2-3g/day. However, they do tend to make me nauseous if I don't take them with a LARGE meal. If I take them with some oats and protein shake, I get terrible nausea/burping. If I take it with a large full meal, then generally I don't have any problems. I think it's a personal thing however, not a product issue.\n",
      "This is a great fish oil product at a great price.\n",
      "I think this is a very good source for EFA's...and no after taste.\n",

      "Excellent product. I take one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It helps me sweat a lot more and I've lost weight without even changing my diet much.\n",
      "I believe it is helping shed more body in my journey. I don't know if I'm suppose to feel anything from taking them, but i do notice big changes in my Abs and waist area. I have been putting in serious work in the gym these last 10 weeks, but i continue to take the product. I take 3 a day (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) It could be my hard work thats being put in and this product together.  I don't feel, jitters or anything or extra energy when taking them. Either way I think its helping, I will continue with this product. \n",
      "it is working on me, I am  using it over 1 month\n",
      "I have been using this product for 6 months now and I love it. I have gone through a \"bulk\" adding in calories while still taking this product and have gained purely muscle. I definitely lend the success of that to this amazing product! Can't live without it.\n",

      "I've added this to my daily routine along with my wife and feel it has been a major contributor to leaning up.  I only take one pill every morning and I believe it's been effective for us both.  It will continue as a daily routine for me.\n",
      "I liked this product mostly because of its convenience. It's not in powder form no smell or favor to the capsule. Easy. Lost about ten pounds in a month adding this in to my usual supplements. Will be purchasing again. Highly suggest, especially for the great price. \n",
      "Really good price with the buy 1 get 1 free promotion.\n",
      "L-carnitine tartrate can be a great help with a well-balanced diet, just don't confuse it with Acetyl-L-carnitine (which is a good supp as well but little different in working mechanism), because the tartrate is best taken with some fats and carbs as well - so preferably with meals.\n",
      "Only reason I gave 10/9 is the serving directions: \"Take 1 capsule 1 to 3 times daily with or without meals.\". Well, to really utilize the effects of L-carnitine tartrate, take it with meals, and 1 to 3 times a day indeed, but not 500 mg but 1000 (so 2 capsules). I take 2-3 g/day.\n",

The price was GREAT and when I compared L-carn brands, bodybuilding had the best bang for your buck by FAR!! CLA, L-Carn and whey have been the only supplements used during my preps and I believe a lot of my energy, fat loss, and recovery has come from the L-carn. GREAT PRODUCT!\n",

      "I use this product twice a day. Once in the morning and than again before my workout at night. It is working good for me to help get rid of the stubborn belly fat and love handles. I will point out that this products synergy works best when utilized with a proper workout program and diet. We all know that there is no magic pill that will just burn the fat away without the work, but bodybuilding.com  L-Carnitine, is helping to burn that fat with my workout/ cardio regiment. I have been using this product for 3 months, and along with Yohimbe I have lost a combined 44 LBS.\n",
      "This is a tougher one to know for sure how much its working, I only take it on workout days, pre-workout meal and post workout shake and usually with dinner.  I don't think it is all mental, I haven't shed gobs of weight, but I definetely think it is helping my progress and is helping me lose some fat, especially around my waistline.  \n",
      "I have lost fat in some troublesome areas since I've been taking this with CLA, fish oil, and green tea, not sure if its the pills or the dieting/cardio alone. I only plan on taking it for about six months. I give it 8 instead of 10 is because I've read that it should be taken 3 times per day; this means its about $15 per month. Since I'm not 100% it works I don't want to say its amazing.\n",

      "the product is too good for the price!\n",
      "I bought this on a great deal that Bodybuilding.com was having. BOGO Free if I remember correctly. The price was $15-20 per bottle of 120 caps, which is a great deal. But after doing a fair amount of research I realized that L-Carnitine was not the product I wanted for my goals.\n",
      "I have to say, this one actually made me lose weight, the product is too good for the price! \n",
      "Great price on this product. No side effects from it and my sensitive stomach was okay. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's not going to make a major difference by itself, but it will help lower body fat. Used it with CLA and took 4 a day\n",
      "Love it no side effect take it 3 times a day with cla only down side is the capsules are a little big for my liking\n",
      "I've been using this product consistently for the past few months.  I use one a day in the morning with my multivitamin and fish oil.  I am not aware of its effects.  I do not notice any increases in energy compared to days that I skip it.  However, it's relatively cheap (especially when BB does b1g1 deals!), and I have never noticed any negative side effects - so this alone gives it a great rating because although I don't notice it helping, it's not hurting me either!  \n",

      "I plan to continue using this product to help achieve my weight loss goals.  Just with all \"safe\" supplements, nothing is a substitute a good diet which has been the most critical component to my 20lb weight loss in the past 7 months.  \n",
      "Good product. Very good price.\n",

      "Great product for cutting carbs. I use this during competition prep and ketosis. Highly recommended as a year round supplement\n",
      "Highly recommend.  Aided with recovery and I believe it definitely aids in moving fat.  Have seen myself lean out while taking it and I always felt on top of my game after intense workouts.  Price is great too especially with the buy 1 get 1 free promo!  Solid product.\n",

They do not compromise on the quality. \n",

      "I use this product to help me loss fat instead of taking OTC diet pills. I take it with Green Tea Extract and Yohimbine and let me tell you once I started taking this stuff the weight started to drop. I was on a plateau for about two months, then I started with these supplements into my exercise and the weigh started to drop immediately. I don't expect those results for everyone but it works wonders for me and a few other friends of mine as well. I highly recommend it, it also boost memory too, so if that is one of your problems (as for one of friends) it helps in that area too!\n",
      "This is the first bodybuilding.com supplement I've tried and it's been great so far. I used this while I was cutting, and it gave me alot of energy before I do my 30mins on the bike.

      "I read several reviews of this product - particularly the negative ones, having used this product for several years without reading any reviews.\n",
      "To refute one rating of a \"3\", I have NEVER found this product to be caked or clumpy.  As for its grittiness, I find no noticeable difference when mixed in a protein shake between this product and the protein and creatine that I add.  NO supplement such as this is intended to blend totally and dissolve 100%!!  What effectiveness would it have on your body if water dissolved the produce totally?  You would LOSE all of its nutritive value through urine and sweat then!!\n",
      "Now, I DO add several dry-packs one I open the container, because I tote it around in my gym bag and mix a drink at the gym.  So as not to absorb any humidity in the gym (c'mon, let's get real here folks... a gym is a sweat lodge even with air conditioning and fans!!)\n",
      "And, since I have gained from 175# to 205# over a 2 year period, I would attribute most  recuperation and some growth to this product.\n",
      "Have to rate it a 10.\n",
      "While this is \"unflavored\" it does have a slight aftertaste which I personally find unpleasant.  I had been taking Optimum Nutrition Glutamine which is unflavored, and has no after taste.  This was cheaper than the ON Glutamine, but I am not sure it is worth the small difference in price.\n",
      "I like that it has no flavor. You can mix it with any supps and you don't need to increase the amount of water. I've had faster recovery time and I take it twice when I know I worked out harder than usual.\n",
      "Product is essentially tasteless no matter if your drinking it by itself of in a protein shake or pre-workout. Does the job great boost in recovery time.\n",
      "Nice product. Mixes well.\n",
      "One of the worst tasting and grittiest powders I've ever had. I can't even mask the bitter flavor in a protein shake or fruit drink. It does not dissolve either, even after shaking it vigorously. I think there are far better products out there for a similar price, or worth paying a couple dollars more. This tastes like, and has the consistency of baking soda. It comes somewhat clumpy inside the container as well. I only give a 3 in the overall because I suppose it still works, but what good is a product that you despise taking and want to skip dosing\n",
      "Best quality and best price. Go ahead and buy the 1000g tub and save yourself lots of money. Worth every penny, recovery is amazing!\n",
      "dissolves easily fulfills its function 10/10\n",
      "Good price and great product. Before Bodybuilding.com Foundation Series Micronized Glutamine I used different brads glutmaine products and this one has the same quality! So why to buy expensive ones?\n",
      "Good old glutamine! Taste like pure glutamine, and helps with recovery. Thumbs up\n",
      "Great value.  Has helped with recovery. \n",
      "Why buy another glutamine supplement when this is the cheapest and the best quality at the same time?\n",
      "This Glutamine has a great quality to it.  I have been using this Glutamine for months now and I see no reason why I will switch to anyone elses this one is exactly what it says and thats perfect.\n",
      "Great bang for the buck. Seems to work just as well as the 'other stuff' I was getting locally but about 15-20% cheaper. It's a little gritty and the taste (when just mixed alone with water) is a bit like dirt but it is easily masked by adding your dose to your protein shakes. I'd buy again.\n",
      "Great product. Better than some other top brands. Dissolves pretty easily and quickly.  \n",
      "I dig this stuff.  I mix a scoop of it with my protein powder and it mixes beautifully AND there is no taste to it.  Such a nice alternative to pills when I already take a ton of vitamins and supplements on a daily basis.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Very good bulk price for basic glutamine powder. Unflavored, I just mix with PWO and post workout drinks, can't even taste it. Has been extremely effective with muscle recovery when lifting multiple times a day.\n",
      "Mixes perfectly with my protein, no flavor or aftertaste.\n",
      "I mix this in with my pre-workout, intra-workout, and pre-bed shake and it mixes well with no adverse affects to the taste of what it is being mixed with.  Definitely helping with recovery!\n",
      "Hard to tell if it work.....but it mixes well with any whey protein and it doesnt affect the taste of the shake .\n",
      "Best price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best bang for your buck with pure glutamine. Very fine powder, mixes in very easily with just water if you so desire but it will give the water a slightly off taste; but I just throw it in to my post workout protein shake. The container it comes in is filled to the brim with the product which I like, sometimes you get a huge container that's only 25% full which for some reason bugs me!\n",
      "No taste to this which is fine b/c I add it to shakes and smoothies.  Overall it seems to be a quality product, but hard to tell if it is actually working.  I will say that I still get sore the morning after a workout and Glutamine is supposed to help with that.  So in that regard, doesn't seem to work all that great.  \n",
      "Efficacy is great! Tastes like feet though!\n",
      "Simple product that is unflavored but does what it's supposed to.  5g is standard for glutamine in powder form and you can't beat this price.  \n",
      "I always tell everyone to buy bodybuilding.com products if they are on a budget. this glutamine mixes well, helps with recovery time and does everything other name brands do. the price for the amount servings is unbeatable. and if you can trust bodybuilding with delivery, you can try their products you wont be dissapointed.\n",

I would definitely recommend this product to everyone I know and most certainly will be buying this product again. -DavGuil \n",

When I received it and opened it I was really surprised about quality and I think its even better quality than ON or other famous brands. They have better price than other and I will definitely gladly buy them again. I trust them from now on and they offer high quality supplements for less money. Thank you! \n",

I actualy really enjoyed this product. it goes hand at hand with creatine so I suggest those together. even when I got off creatine I did not notice a decrease in water weight/loss of gains. it seemed the glutamine helped with that. I would recommend glutamine. as for the flavor it is unflavored but it still has  bad flavor to it. the unflavored creatine I have has zero taste but this does. if you mix in flavored drink you wont notice it but if you mix in water you will. great product though :)\n",

I haven't slept like this since I was a teenager (I'm 29). I feel fuller and my workouts have become more efficient as my recovery is better. Is this stuff steroids? I've never taken steroids so I can't completely comment but I can still definitively say no. BUT, I can say that it does optimize my endogenous system to optimal levels, and this is coming from a former D1 athlete \n",
      "purchased this product  aweek ago so far so........good\n",
      "Don't expect a significant change in physique using this, although you will see some change\n",
      "Used  this, felt nothing absolutely. 3 capsules morning. 3 capsules evening. Nothing changes.But nothing. Worthless\n",
      "6 capsules a day is a bit more than I like but well worth the results. I'd recommend this product for anyone trying to get their T level up. \n",

      "I really enjoyed this product!!! Im 42 and respond to test boosters pretty well.  Started working about 3 weeks in and have definitely gotten bigger and stronger.  Will use again for sure!!! \n",
      "Alpha protocol is an awesome natural test booster. I definitely felt Ian increase in overall energy and greater body composition while using this product.\n",
      "This definitely gives me the little extra boost and kick in the gains when I use this for bulking season. Recovery in a bliss and great mood modulator, not aroused all the time which is a good thing. Be aware, zits on your back or face, so far just my back...kinda one of the few ways I know that it's working. \n",

      "From barely repping 185 6 times on bench to repping it 4 sets of 8 then finishing it with 4 reps of 225. All in the matter of a month, i gotta say that the strength and lean muscle i've gained from this in such a short period of time is pretty incredible.\n",
      "Great Product! After putting on some mass I took this while cutting to help maintain my size, combined with inciner-8 I cut my fat dramatically and was actually able to get a little bigger while doing so. Nearing 30 I felt that a test booster with the amount of exercise I needed was crucial, it certainly helped where it counts!\n",
      "Been using Alpha Protocol for 5 months. I've seen awesome gains in all my weights. I'm not sure if this is a lot, but I've gained almost 1/2\" in my biceps in that 5 months. I personally can see the benefits of using this product. My girlfriend said I look huge after the 5 month period. I'm consider myself an average lifter. I've tried other test boosters and saw zero results. One draw back is a weird plastic taste if taken on and empty stomach. Second month on AP I wanted to ***** every women I saw, but that has leveld off.\n",
      "I used this product in the platinum ultimate stack from bb.com. All the other products work so well it was hard for me to feel it but the results were noticeable.\n",

I have noticed a drop off in my Libido over the last couple of years and well I guess it's time catching up to me as a few greys set in etc. I've taken AP over the last 30 days and I notice I am more alert, more energized and seem to be more motivated which I love. Even if I go out on the weekend and pound 10 beers throughout the night, my hangovers seem less intense and I am not ruined for the rest of the day like I used to be. I have gained some strength, but I am still skepticle if this is the cause. I just ordered 2 more months worth. I truly feel this is not the placebo effect and hope to see more results in the gym but my test continues..\n",

      "One of the best stim-free fat burners out there!\n",

      "So far so good.  I noticed and increase in focus and energy.  Definite appetite suppression, however, (for those of you saying it doesn't) when it's time to eat...it's time to eat.  I just don't get mid meal cravings.  I skipped lunch one day due to busy schedule.  That day I felt extremely lightheaded.   So don't skip...just make a good choice.  I also decreased my coffee due to the added caffeine in the product.  Stay tuned!\n",
      "Didn't curb my hunger as much as I wished it did. It did burn fat though, which is always good. \n",
      "I've used this product for 2 weeks now.  Makes me hungry all day.  No fat burn at all.  Exercise 7-8 times a week, 1.5 to 2.5 hrs per day with 30-60 minutes cardio and 30-60 minutes weight training. I do loose pounds, but not from using this product. Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this...waisted my money.  Does provide a little energy.\n",
      "Notice some women wrote that it works for them.  It doesn't seems to work for men, I guess.\n",

      "I have lost 4-5kg in the past using Super HD and Shred Matrix.\n",
      "great dosage and not overly powerful on the stimulants. great if youre looking for a daily dose of keto-7 and L-Carnitine. appetite suppressant worked well for me and saw results within 2 weeks.\n",
      "I think this is a goood quality fat burner. After 2 days of supplimentation I had increased energy which is good when I'm in high school. I focus better and not to mention that i lost 1 pound and ate 600 caloriies less than i usually did before. This my be the suppliment that'll finally get me in the 140 lb range again after 3 years\n",
      "I've tried several different fat burners, still looking for the one that works best for me, but this one is NOT it. No energy increase, and probably most disappointing of all, no appetite suppression what-so-ever. Disappointed with these results, after just about a month of usage, especially after reading some of the reviews.\n",
      "Awesome!! Doesn't make me jittery or wired. Can take a little at a time or more on those days when ya need the extra help. Good energy and appetite suppressant.\n",
      "Insignificant effect on me\n",

      "Great level of caffeine! No jitters good energy, and it has all the other extras that most people need to buy and stack. I tried the CLK by cellucor then saw that this has the 7-keto and l carnitine, not only a great product but saved me ton of cash. Started taking this around 9% Bodyfat, now down to 5.9% with proper nutrition of course!\n",
      "Ive had this product for about a week now and its going well so far for me. Ive lost about 2kgs whilst taking this product, cutting carbs and using interval training. What i thought was good: the ingredient list looks good, capsicum extract definitely helps appetite suppression, felt an increase in temperature (so i assume thermo burning works) and lastly if you're from AUS this isnt banned! My only issue was the first 2 days of using this product i had issues with sleeping (because i was not used to the extra caffeine, never really drank coffee and this was the first thermo fat burner ive tried). My advice for anyone else in a similiar position start with 2 tablets x 2 daily for the first two days then shift to 3 tablets x 2 daily.\n",

      "I am really dissapointed about this product, after I complete 1 bottle and doing extreme diet, taking all the right supplements including CLA, OMEGA 3, Protein Shake with No carbs, MultiVitamin, I have lost only 4 pounds.  I do feel that I have less fat in my body, however last time I took a fat burner it was Oxy Elite Pro and doing the same I lost 15 pounds.\n",

      "This product was not even the slightest helpful in providing any assistance as a fat burner.  I followed the directions to the letter and continued to monitor my meals and exercised as I have done for the past 6 months.  I was not expecting any miracles but due to its cost and what I thought were favorable results from others, this product did nothing for me.  I give it a 2 because although it did not help me, it did not cause me any adverse effects.  To me, a complete waste of money.\n",
      "My friend and I tried this product with a low expectations due to previous experience and we both love this product.  We have been taking this product for roughly one month and the results are shocking.  Over the last 2 weeks alone you can can see noticable loss in the stomach with a measument loss of 2 inches.  The best part is that this product does not make you feel \"jitery.\"  I lift 3-4 times per week and cardio the other 2 days with one full day off.\n",
      "I have been taking other fat burners for a couple of years off and on. Usually get the jittery feeling because of the amount of caffeine in those products. Dropped all the others and decided to use the INCINER-8 for the end of a long cut. I kept the same workout routine and have been able to shed those last few stubborn pounds with this product. I do not have the jitters at all with this product. Would definitely recommend to others. Purchasing a new supply today! \n",

      "\n",

      "In fact it is good - I used two packs of this product .. really wonderful .. the first hour after using it I feel the strength of the carry - gives me a strong push - then my body starts to relax - I recommend it - I loved it\n",
      "I really like BPI - their BCAA's are a great product but this one is a miss. It doesn't mix well, and I didn't feel like it gave me the boost I was expecting. Kinda a bummer.\n",
      "Mild energy. The cherry lime flavor does not taste good.\n",
      "Very disappointed with this product. I LOVE their BCAA's! however this pre-workout is a total let down. I do get a little energy, but nothing crazy; definitely no \"pump\". The taste is horrible and the worse part is that you can't drink the whole thing because it doesn't dissolve properly. It is very gritty and it feels like you are drinking sand.  No wonder it was on SALE, now I'm stuck with two containers of this unpleasant pre-workout. There's no doubt that JYM is by far the best pre-workout I have taken. \n",
      "Mix-ability-2\n",
      "Flavor-5\n",
      "Pump-4\n",
      "Very gritty. So gritty you can't drink the entire thing without gagging and it doesn't stay down well. Didn't get much of a pump with this product. Focus was pretty good but overall this product is a bust. BPI is a great company and I love some of their other products (Best Pre-workout and Best BCAA), unfortunately 1.M.R Vortex isn't a good one at least for me.\n",
      "This flavor used to be my favorite, simply because it didn't taste as sweet as the others. When I ran out I reordered and it tastes completely different now. Way too sweet. Hopefully they go back to making the original one. \n",
      "Its just OK to be honest. I wouldn't buy it again that's for sure mostly because it doesn't mix well and its like drinking cherry lime sand water....\n",
      "In a couple of weeks I will be beginning the Kris Gethin 12 week daily trainer, so I wanted to try this out before I used it for an extended period of time. Man, does it work. I was able to exert myself and up my weight more than I had in months. The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because of the mixability / flavor. It's ok, just not a great flavor. Overall great product and I won't hesitate to buy again.\n",
      "Maybe I'm just used to the \"let's do this\" feeling with other pre-workouts but after 30 minutes into my workout with this supplement I felt fatigued and ready to be done. I keep it in my cupboard for those days when I run out of my other pre-workouts and it helps get me started but I won't buy it again.   \n",
      "this is not pump given it just make my workout longer \n",
      "Great preworkout! The taste was good but the effects were even better. After 15-20 minutes of taking 1.M.R Vortex, I got a good amount energy where I was dancing in between sets haha. As for the reps, the product lives up to the name. I have noticed workouts without vortex weren't as intense as when I did take vortex. Definitely a must buy!\n",
      "\n",
      "This product gives me tremendous focus and sustainable energy throughout my workout. I will definitely be sticking with this product for awhile. Tastes great and mixes great as well. I've tried all of the flavors, they all taste GREAT! My personal favorites are Snow Cone and Cherry Lime.\n",
      "The only thing good I will say about this product is you do notice when it kicks in completely (literally mid-workout did 8 reps to failure, next set did 12). However, it makes you extremely jittery, not just at the gym, ALL DAY. I just felt weird all day and then I would even have trouble sleeping 17-18 hours after I took it. With as many other and better PWOs on the market, don't waste your money on this one. I'm not very happy with any of the BPI products.\n",
      "I like the focus it gives me. I can plow through my workouts with no problems. Fruit punch is my favorite flavor.\n",
      "On average capacity, weaker eksplod, and 2-3 times more powerful Assault. Overall very satisfied.\n",
      "I like pre-workouts. It gets my blood pumping and a good sweat going even before I hit the weights. The BPI line has been great so far. Has been the one product line that has work best with my body and hasn't been overwhelming. I usually take it first thing in the morning and 20 minutes later, have a full-blown sweat going. The Cherry Lime for me is a little potent and a little grainy when mixing it in a shaker cup, but overall I love the stuff!\n",
      "Worst pre-workout I've tried, taken as instructed and no effect at all, no extra energy not even the tingles like I usual get with pre-workouts. now stuck with 3 tubs.\n",
      "I absolutely love this pre workout powder... The increased energy and drive have been helping me to achieve my weightloss goals.\n",
      "Ive even had my wife use it a couple times .. Her advice was for me to order more.. So I did..\n",
      "Effective and cheap. I'd put this on similar performance standards with Assault and C4, which are two of the PWO thats work for me. I took this in the am before my 9-5 and it gave me a kick to get through the my workout in the morning and also keep me functional at work. I'm all about efficiency, and with small scoops I was able to dump them into my mouth with some water and gulp it down. Made taking the servings seconds rather than wasting the time of mixing in a bottle. Will definitely order again, great price for a effective PWO. \n",
      "I HATED this flavor.  OMG it was awful and it would not mix well.  I just trashed this and bought a different one from the local store.  I DO NOT recommend this flavor to anyone.  I really hope they pull it off the shelf.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I did like the fruit punch flavor and it does the job of getting me go.\n",
      "Great preworkout without hates side effects. Love the snow cone flavor! Will definitely buy more \n",
      "Terrible flavor.  Will not dissolve in water fully - very gritty and leaves a nasty taste in my mouth.  Not worth any benefits as I hated trying to choke it down so I wouldn't take it.  I don't know if I had a bad batch but I was stunned at how bad it is.  I have loved bpi sports' best bcaa so I thought this would be great as well.  \n",
      "This is a great pre-workout powder. Not only do I really enjoy the fruit punch flavor, but it also maintains its strength through out my workout. I highly recommend it. \n",
      "This doesn't work at all ,, I already used this for 4 days but the energy and the focus is same as before... Not shake well at all.... There's a etching in stomach in the middle of the workout ,,,, Is there any one please guide me how to use this for maximum gain ,,,,,,\n",
      "I like this one, but i prefer stronger ones\n",
      "love this snow cone! tastes just like one when i was a kid. also, i dont get jitters with this which i love--usually i'm sensitive to pre-workout products \n",
      "This is one of the pre workouts I trust bpi is one of my favorite companies and their products are good.. I tried 3 vortex flavors and have cherry lime but I won't be trying it for a bit so yea definitely give this a try it will give you a great energy boost which will push you to your limit. Even tho I rated all flavors 9 fruit punch has to be my favorite so far\n",
      "This pre-workout is unbeliveable, I started with one scoop for 3-4 days and than two scoops for 3-4 days, and the pump and mind muscle connection was better but not on that level compared when I took 3 and a half scoops, the pump/mind muscle connection and STRENGTH was way better. I felt the effect of it after only 15 minutes and lasted for me about 3 hours. And one more thing that should be mentioned is that I noticed is that it helps thinking better and faster too outside the gym. \n",
      "Pretty good so far.  I replaced my Fitmiss Ignite for this and it doesn't give me that crazy feeling some preworkout do.  I've noticed an increase in energy while working out and I'm able to complete more reps without stopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1/24/16 update...still going strong with this preworkout.  Tried another brand and ended up coming back top this although I'm not a fan of the sour watermelon,  it gets the job done. \n",
      "I have always bought the trial size of this and was always happy with my purchase.  on sale, I bought the full size version and I was very disappointed.  The snow cone didn't taste like snow cone at all anymore.  Before, it was a bluish color, now its a brownish color and MY guess is that the product either went bad or there was a manufacturing error and problem.  I ended up throwing these away.  I am going to wait awhile before purchasing again, but as of now, i am going to be using a different preworkout, then drink my Best BCAA during my workouts.\n",
      "This products really works, i can feel the energy in just a few minutes. I can do better workouts now. The little only problem is that after 2 week, the effect is less, so better not to take it every day (every workout day of course), so you can feel the energy really when you need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the flavor, I just try in a sample Fruit Punch, wasnt too good but wasnt bad. As for cherry lime, I really dont like it, but cant recommend a good flavor because I still not found the better for me, but hey, every one is different, and the products really works\n",
      "I enjoy this product, however moreso for focus during the workday than for getting me pumped up for a workout. I am able to focus significantly more after drinking this supplement, but I have noticed that I begin to lag in the middle of a workout, and not even a long workout. For those days I switch to N.O.Xplode, which always gets the job done. \n",
      "On the other hand, this product doesn't give you that need to workout NOW feeling, with the itchy face and body tingles. I, personally, enjoy the tingles. \n",
      "The powder also doesn't mix well, I have to shake it pretty continuously when drinking it, but the flavor is good! \n",
      "I probably won't get this product again for a pre-workout. \n",
      "Did not enjoy, will not purchase again. Makes you light headed and shaky which in turn makes you not want to work out and when you do it is not a very good one. when you get done you still do not feel good. this is not based off one time it is based off the duration of the tub. as for flavor and mixability those are both not there either. you think it mixes and then when you get to the bottom it is grainy and chunky. No bueno\n",
      "Got the job done, great flavor.\n",
      "I purchased these during a sale on BPI products so the money invested was a small amount. However, there was still very little bang for the buck. The product does not mix well. If you try stirring, it will leave clumps and if you use a shaker, it does not settle. The affect is also very weak. I will not be purchasing again regardless of the price.\n",
      "I've tried quite a few pre-workouts and while this one isn't at the bottom of the list its not far off.  It mixes horrible.  It doesn't matter how much water you use it still won't mix.  I use the bcaa version and the fruit punch tastes great but with this one its only ok.  Overall I wouldn't recommend.  You do get nice energy with it but don't take on an empty stomach.  \n",
      "Great product \n",
      "\n",
      "The flavors of these are great, def a 10 there, the actual energy and focus is pretty decent as well. but my gripe this doesn't mix well. . . add less water or more water still leaves a residue and if you're like me and then use the same bottle for your bcaas for your workout without rinsing it out you'll def get that calky taste and debris left over in the cup which Is annoying. other than that does what it says it does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixed up the sour-watermelon flavor with around 5 ounces of water. Mixed decent for the most part, once I got to the last few sips it was a bit gritty. It did not taste overly carbonated, and the flavor was spot on. Wasn’t too bitter or too overwhelming, but right where I would like it. I would say it is certainly one of the better tasting pre-workouts I have tried so far. As far as the workout, I had great focus, and a great sweat. No tingle, nothing of that sort, which I was okay with since it was a heavy cardio day. I have a few more servings of this and will certainly be finishing the small tub. I would recommend this for someone who doesn’t want to be over stimulated, but can get a solid focus and workout. \n",
      "Have tried only three or so pre workout supplements in the past. Because they tend to have some weird chemical tastes, I decided to stick with fruit punch for safety. I am really happy with the vortex product. I will definitely try other flavors in the future. Fruit punch is just fine, however I wouldn't mind trying some more exotic flavors like snow cone and sour watermelon!\n",
      "\n",
      "Other pre workout drinks make my skin boil and itch. I feel like when I took them I had to be at the gym within 15 minutes or else my skin was going to start to itch and crawl. They were so powerful that I would feel terrible if I didn't sweat them out of me. With BPI Vortex, I do not get that itchy skin feel at all. At first I thought, maybe this stuff is too week, since the scoop they give you looks like it might only be a teaspoon of product. However, I notice that I was a hell of a lot more alert and awake. Even on those days that I was just lazy and tire I would take the vortex and ready to lift.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for performance, I recently forgot to take tone day and felt really week. I ended up lifting something like 15 pounds and two reps of every workout. I was just shocked! I felt like I dint get a good workout that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations- I would recommend that you eat solid food an hour before taking this supplement. If you take it on an empty stomach, you will find that you will push so hard at the gym with Vortex, that you will want to throw up. It took me a half and hour to walk a normal 8 minute walk home. I was trying not to loose my **** in front of the shopping center.\n",
      "I ordered the cherry lime flavour and it is so awful tasting it is hard to drink. I also got sour watermelon and really like the flavor of it but with the cherry lime I would recommend not to buy tastes horrible.\n",
      "This is my go to preworkout. I have tried a million different preworkouts. I am hard to get going and this stuff lights a fire under my ***. It is a little hard to mix but the flavor and the energy that you get from it is totally worth it. I order this stuff by the truck loads and will continue to do so!\n",
      "Tryed this because it looked like the best value for money (50 servings 25 dollars) and it really is! Gives me more energy and focus and just a unique stimulated feeling in 1 scoop then other pre workouts in 1.5-2 scoops, also it really increased my body temperature quickly..however sometimes it could be a little too much and kind of gets me jittery and out of breath..so for me I really have to watch the dosing carefully, not much of a crash but defiantly a come-down in energy after around a hour..not much of a pump from this but this really isn't that kind of product. Overall, if your not very stimulant sensitive and want a REAL KICK and something unique I would really recommend this however If your pretty sensitive this might be to strong and just overwhelming for you...BTW Sour watermelon was really good but fruit punch just had too much of an after taste,,both mixed okay but really made too much foaming in the cup! \n",
      "I really wanted to like this pre-workout more.. I really did.. But it is just really chalky and hard to drink.  And honestly I get little to no effects from the 1.M.R Vortex. It does have something to it but not very powerful I usually mix with another pre-workout to help blend and give more effect when im in gym.\n",
      "This product is really good if mixed with their Pump Hd. \n",
      "I'm not sure if it was a bad batch or what--since it was clumpy in no time-- but this stuff was useless. Even after taking two scoops, I felt nothing.... I actually took this once and fell asleep about 15 minutes after. The blueberry lemon ice tastes good, but it mixes horribly.. grainy no matter how long I stir/shake. I got this as part of the BOGO offer, but I'm giving the sour watermelon tub to someone else.\n",
      "this is a below average pre workout, i felt a mild kick but nothing that lasted, mix well but grainy, the sour watermelon taste awesome. i usually took 2 full scoops\n",
      "\n",
      "Turned onto this from recommendations in a fitness magazine. I didn't like the jitters I felt from some other pre-workout powders in the past and those were eliminated in Vortex. Plus the Sour Watermelon is fantastic, I'll admit I was skeptical when reading the reviews at first.\n",
      "Gives you a serious energy pump! The sour watermelon is delicious. Kinda have to give it a good shake in a blender bottle, but it blends well enough and goes down smooth and fizzy like (I like to gulp it before it settles). Will definitely buy again. Makes me feel like I can push more and even when I'm tired, like I said, gives you that jolt. \n",
      "I wanted to like this. I really did! I had heard good things about bpi products and there was a great sale on this. It just didn't work for me. I felt no rush, no pump, nothing. I didn't even really make me feel motivated (like others have). I actually just had to purchase another pre-workout (even though I have an unopened pack of this stuff left). The blueberry lemon ice flavor was pleasant, but it was so gritty and I always end up with a gritty slop at the bottom of my cup that I have to choke down. Would not purchase again. \n",
      "Let me start of by saying I clicked five day shipping and got this the next day soo a+ for shipping taste is very good I usually just put a scoop in my mouth with no water haven't tried in water amazing price compared to c4 products and good amount of servings good energy to aboat the same as c4 but less money and more servings taste a little better to. Ps. Have nothing against c4 pre workout just think this product is a lot better\n",
      "It was an ok product. It upset my stomach and turned my stomach sour every time I took it. I have only took 2 or 3 servings and still have a brand new container of it besides the one I have took some out of. \n",
      "Alternating this with Mr. Hyde, and I gotta say, I felt less fatigued and could do more reps on my sets. This stuff works!\n",
      "I tried this supplement but it's taste like cough syrup and i don't thInk so it's pre workout.\n",
      "Literally the best pump. I've tried several pre-workouts that are caffeine based and they give me a high and I feel disorganized through my workout. This definitely gives me the internal pump and makes me feel READY and IN THE ZONE rather than hyperactive. Love it! Flavor is ehhh but just shake it a lot and add tons of water in my experience! \n",
      "This is the best preworkout i have ever tried while ive only used about 4~5 this one far exceeds them. The taste is great, the focus it brings is awesome, and the energy is intense although not jittery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes horrible like expired chemicals. I don't know if its just the one I received but I don't like it at all; I find myself forcing it down. It also doesn't provide much of a strength booth, just a little bit energy.\n",
      "I love this stuff. All of my past pre-workouts have been beta-a based (C4, The Curse, etc.). Those were good, but I'm a bit of a pansy when it comes to taste. I'm sure everyone who has tried a pre-workout has had the displeasure of that final sip that didn't mix and feels like drinking bitter chunks of gravel. 1.M.R has yet to leave me with anything other than a good, even taste and energy.\n",
      "1.M.R doesn't get me nearly as hyped up and into crazy mode like others, but something about it just feels cleaner to me. I don't cramp and get the *****, it blends perfectly, the taste is actually enjoyable (tastes sorta like one of those Hawaiian Punch packets you can mix with a bottle of water), and I've yet to get any kind of shakes or tingles. So the reason I give it 9/10 is because for me, this is a near perfect product. With my workouts, I don't need so much focus I'll stare at the wall for ten minutes without blinking; I simply need something that gives me a little kick in the ***. I'll definitely be reordering!\n",
      "The taste is good but I do not feel any kind of effect when I take it. I don't feel any new strenght, no heart acceleration or motivation. Maybe I'm tolerant to this specific product.\n",
      "Worked pretty well\n",
      "I've tried this pre-workout and I just love it. By far one of my favorite pre-workouts.  Don't get jittery nor itchy but I get good energy and  pump along with more endurance for my workout. It's been very consistent with how I feel during a work out. Would definitely recommend and try this product.\n",
      "This is a good pre workout but I wouldn't say its great. It depends on what you're looking for but this doesn't give you that face numbing pre workout feeling. It does get my heart racing and I sweat way more than normal when I use it. There is one definitely downside and it could just be the way my body reacts to it but I absolutely have to \"crap\" right after I drink this, no matter what, I drank it before a 5 mile run the other day and had to stop on the side of the road, no joke, so now I go to the bathroom every single time. Just something to be weary of. I still love the product and would recommend it I'm just not obsessed with it.\n",
      "One of the best flavored preworkouts on the market.  Mixes easily and no grit at the bottom of my shaker bottle.  However I don't feel 1 scoop of this preworkout gives me the effects I want in a preworkout.  Minimal boost if anything in energy and focus.  I've tried to double scoop this preworkout and I'll have a good workout with good energy and focus, but the yohimbe does terrible things to my body like giving me the shakes, racing heart rate, and inability to sleep that night(even when taken early afternoon).  At 1 scoop, my body doesn't have any problem with the effects of yohimbe.  Lower to moderate stim tolerance, 1 scoop should work for you.  High stim tolerance and it may not work the best for you.\n",
      "To date, I have used BSN’s N.O. Xplode, Musclepharm’s Assault, O.N.’s Pre-Workout, and this brand, BPI Vortex.  I purchased 2 tubs when it was BOGO.  Vortex worked pretty well at first but I got used to it fairly quickly.  I no longer felt the tingles after 2 scoops and started feeling tired in my workouts. It mixes poorly and often times, just ate the grit still left in the bottom of my cup.  If you use a shaker, it will get all foamy and disgusting.\n",
      "Wonderful taste and great energy & focus upon consumption. This is part of my daily routine, before hitting the gym! \n",
      "I have tried MANY preworkouts and kept hearing about this brand's awesome snow cone flavor and decided to branch out from my normal c4. Disregarding the taste, I just don't care for 1.M.R Vortex in general. I do not get a  \"pump\" compared to when I use other preworkouts and the taste is overpowering and too sweet, almost syrupy-like, and this is coming from someone with a huge sweet tooth. I've given it a good 2 weeks to maybe get used to it, or possibly grow to like it.. But I will end up giving this tub away and ordering more c4.\n",
      "BPI Best products are my favorite as they always deliver per the label.  Most pre's that I've taking in the past has always given me the jitters, that awful itchy feeling from the Niacin (B) or just left me feeling nauseous.  BPI Best Preworkouts does not have any of those effects on me and I'm very happy with the quality of the product. It keeps you focused and it doesn't give you that crash feeling once the energy wears off (a HUGE plus for me ) The flavors are to die for, the Snow Cone smells and tastes like that blue cotton candy you see at your local state fair.  Sour Watermelon tastes like a jolly rancher yum-o!  Overall this product is definitely a keeper and will be ordering more of BPI products! :-)\n",
      "este produto dá uma animada, mas nada de mais. creio que seja mais pela cafeína em si. o gosto do de melancia não é bom. um ponto que li em outros relatos e que não gostei foi a difícil solubilidade - não mistura completamente.\n",
      "eu tomo duas vezes ao dia, pela manhã assim que acordo e antes do treino.\n",
      "não voltarei a comprar. prefiro o neuro core.\n",
      "Just didn't experience much of anything as I have with other products.\n",
      "It did provide a slight increase in energy as it is better than taking nothing. However for the same price I'll look elsewhere for pre-workout. \n",
      "really unstuck product\n",
      "waste my money\n",
      "\n",
      "I really hate to give Bpi a poor review, but I have to. The taste was above average, but the reason I give this a 6 is because it doesn't mix well. Numerous times would I be swallowing chunks, and no one cares for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been lifting for 2+ years and have tried Neurocore, C4, Mr. Hyde, and NO xplode. Vortex is by far the worst. When I take it and go to the gym, I feel as if I didn't even take a pre workout. It gives you 1/5 the mental focus neurocore does, and 1/10 of the tingly feeling C4 gives. I tried taking 2 scoops and it just made my heart beat really fast, and my face turned red. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will say, however, this would be a good pre-workout for a beginner. It doesn't give you the tingles and isn't seriously intense focus wise. Perfect to take for a month or two until you're ready to get into the more serious PWO's.\n",
      "Well the best thing this PWO has going for it is it is really cheap. The bad thing is it wasn't great for my energy and I got no pump. The taste is ok but there is a gritty chemical taste which I believe is the yohimbe.  Half of the time I'd take it I would feel nauseous or jittery, I'm not a fan of the stimulant feeling this stuff gives me. So I've got 1 1/2 bottles left and they are going in the garbage. I'll stick with NO Xplode or Superpump for my PWO.\n",
      "This stuff tastes great!  I guess I noticed it doesn't mix well either but it tastes great so it doesn't bother me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't notice the weird tingly sensation that I get with C4.  There isn't a jittery energy feeling like their is with C4 which is why I think some people think this stuff doesn't work.  However, it puts me in a GREAT mood which helps me want to do more in my workout.  It also makes me feel clear and awake, again, without that weird jittery feeling.   I am still able to take my melatonin at night and fall asleep after working out with it at 5pm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've only taken a half scoop so far even though I do have a high tolerance for caffeine because I have only been able to workout in the evenings.  Looking forward to trying a whole scoop one morning!   \n",
      "This stuff is a waste of money. You get a good price on a large serving size but it is quite ineffective. I have taken double dose and felt no different from not taking any. The powder does not fully dissolve in the water no matter how much you shake or stir it. The ingredients, just look for yourself and you will realize this is not the pre-workout you want to be spending your money on.\n",
      "I will never buy this again. I've used numerous other products. This is by far the worst tasting product I've tried.  Mixes terribly, large particles that don't disolve or breakdown.  \n",
      "The energy level is equal to other products, but gives a mild amour of nausea. \n",
      "The only benefit was buy one get one, so I have 50 free servings.  However, I now have to suffer through the other flavor as well.  Hopefully the cherry lime will break down and taste better. \n",
      "Best preworkout ever ,,, i love the taste also.. iv never gone through a leg work out so great\n",
      "This stuff is great and I ordered last night  and got it today with standard shipping. Cant be anymore happier!\n",
      "\n",
      "The energy and focus from this is really on point.  Didn't feel much in the way of pump, as others have referenced.  No jitters or tingles.  Lasts through a workout without issue, yet I can still go to bed without issue 3 hours after taking it if need be.  Got the cherry lime and I feel the flavor is great.  Mixing is a little iffy but it really doesn't bother me.   I would definitely recommend it.\n",
      "This is the second pre-workout that I've tried. I'm not a big fan of it its chalky and bitter. Doesn't mix very well in my shaker. I wouldn't recommend using more than one scoop, I was jittery several hours later.\n",
      "I was chosen to log this product. I was a big fan of the original 1MR and this stuff is honestly a step up. The energy and focus I got from this product is probably the best I've had from a pre workout product. I'm also surprised at how much of a pump I got from such a small amount of active ingredients. The flavour I had was Blueberry Lemon Ice and it was one of the best tasting pre workouts I've ever tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only problem I had with this pre workout is that from time to time I would have issues with the yohimbe. At one scoop I was usually fine but a lot of the time, two scoops was too much for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would rate Vortex at a 9-9.5/10. Well done BPI!\n",
      "Good porduct good flavor but the after taste is bitterish \n",
      "This product does the job good flavor not easy to mix but gets me thru  my workouts !\n",
      "Hands down this is my favorite preworkout.  I totally love the boost of energy it give without getting the shakes...for it is also very thermogenic.  The other reason I really like the BPI 1MR Vortex is it doesn't interfere with my sleep.  I take this about 6pm in the evening and have no issues going to bed at 10pm.  Just like any product some will work different for different people, however I recommend at least giving this a try!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The original 1.M.R was an absolute powerhouse of a preworkout so I had huge expectations when I tried the Vortex. This was the exact opposite! One of if not the worst pre workouts I've tried. The flavor wasn't bad but the immediate after taste was horrific and lasted for hours. Got horrible indigestion and bloating as well as nausea. Worst money I've spent in a while.\n",
      "Taste wise is ok. But this stuff has a crazy after taste and its very grainy and very hard to mix. I've had better.\n",
      "Definitely the best tasting pre workout. No after taste, and the energy is on point without any crashing during training. It also works well with some creatine added to it. \n",
      "Great product! Awesome taste! Definately worth the money. Provides good energy to get me through my workout.\n",
      "The originial 1MR is my go-to pre-workout, so I decided to give this one a try. I started with 2 scoops and I was very jittery and made me sweat a lot. The effects felt similar to a fat burner for me. The second time I tried just one scoop and the effects were not as unpleasant, but I feel that it did not have a positive effect on my workout. I gave the rest of the bottle to a friend, who does somewhat like it.\n",
      "This is one of the best pre-workouts I've ever used. I hadn't had it in a while, got a a sample packet and remembered the insane workouts that come from taking it. Highly recommend. \n",
      "Great, quality preworkout. Price is extremely hard to beat on the market. Love the energy, and gives me a kick that lasts a whole workout. It does well with pumps, but is even better when stacked with a pump-oriented product. I've been buying this supp forever and will continue to do so. \n",
      "Honestly this is my favorite pre workout so far.  The sour watermelon is pretty tasty and definately improves my workout and focus. I feel it brings me right up to the point before the tingles... So I'm my opinion it's just right..\n",
      "\n",
      "I was taking BPI Stim-Elite.  Even though it calls itself a \"fat burner\" I took it as a pre-workout.  It has awesome energy, tastes great, and mixes very easily. Apparently bpi stopped making it as it's getting harder to find so  I tried the bpi Vortex hoping it would be similar.  I have to laugh about the caffeine warning. It's pretty low compared to Stim-Elite and other pre-workouts I've tried.  The blueberry lemon ice didn't taste very good to me.  It was also extremely difficult to mix.  I finally gave up and had to drink it with the left over powder chunks which really made it taste bad. I felt no difference what-so-ever after I took Vortex. Definitely won't buy it again.  I wish they wouldn't have stopped making Stim-Elite.\n",
      "Great response time and intense focus! Best pre-workout on the market!!\n",
      "Taste great, good energy throughout my workout. I enjoyed the original 1 M.R. a little bit more but good product. \n",
      "This product doesn't really give me the charge that other pre-workout products deliver. Overall, I am not very impressed. I guess the quality is why it was Buy One Get One Free! \n",
      "I have taken 1MR Vortex in the past and had gotten good results.  I received the sample of the Snow Cone flavor and it is hands down the best tasting pre-workout I have ever had!  I noticed the sample gave me more push than the previous version I used.  I use several other BPI products and I am eager to add this one back into my rotation.\n",
      "Probably one of the best pre workouts I've taken. It's c-4 on roids do not exceed 3 scoops at a time in my opinion. Just the right amount of focus and energy not to much to the point your trying to stay alive during your workout but to the point where you can crush your workout with no problems\n",
      "I've been using Pump-HD , 1MR and 1MR Vortex for years . Vortex is a good pre-workout , I get a good pump from it and it keeps me going through my 70 , 80 min workouts . With that being said I do like the Pump-HD better and wish I could still get it .\n",
      "1.M.R Vortex Is a solid preworkout. Performance wise, it gives me a good pump, and helps extend my sets. Also, it is fast acting. Takes me about 15 minutes to feel the effects. I also was able to take this at night and not have any sleep issues unlike other products I've taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I will say is this does contain Niacin, which seems to give me the gitters unlike any other preworkout product. I know some people like this effect, but personally, I'm not a fan. \n",
      "\n",
      "I rated this a solid 7/10 after going through a whole 30 serving container. It helped during my workouts and I may come back to it later.\n",
      "I used this new formula when they first released it. I really enjoyed it. Have me a good pump and a good amount of energy. The only reason I have stopped using it is to try less caffeinated pre-workouts. Overall if you want to have you have buzzing and blood pumping this is the way to go\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using this pre-workout supplement for about a year now. The sour watermelon is my favorite flavor. Vortex mixes easy and is not clumpy like other pre workouts. It gives me the energy boost in the gym throughout my worKout and keeps me focused. This is one of many great products that I use from BPI and I will continue using it\n",
      "First, the flavor is excellent. So far I've tried snow cone and sour watermelon. I use one scoop with 6oz water. Second,  it kicks in fast about 15 minutes so I drink it on my way to the gym. It lasts through my workout and is especially helpful on my longer days like legs. I don't have trouble with crashing afterwards and I am able to fall asleep without problem. The only thing I don't like about this product is that it doesn't disolve completely, so you get a build up of the granules on the back of your tongue....even if you mix it with extra water(and then the flavor is watered down). However, that won't stop my from using this product again.\n",
      "Taste is great but could be a little sweeter. Focus, & Energy Levels are off the charts.  The only thing holding this product back from a 10 score in my eyes is something to help with a pump.  Maybe some Leucine or even Agmatine.  This product is straight energy in a bottle.  I actually won my first bottle autographed by Jay Cutler and I am on my second one now.  1 scoop about 4:30p and am still able to sleep like a baby by 10:30p.  Love It!!\n",
      "39 yrs old and just needed an extra boost to get back to working hard in the gym. Vortex is very strong and gives me the focus and energy to work for a good hour to hour and a half. I like the pump and the niacin burn also. I've tried three of the flavors and they are all good to great.\n",
      "I've been a fan of 1MR since the original before it was changed. When 1MR Vortex came out I was a little skeptical since nothing has been as good since the original. I was pleasantly surprised and it gave me the right amount of what I was looking for which is rare for me. I prefer a stimulant/head rush focus vs feeling the beta tingles throughout my body. Vortex delivers the perfect balance and gives me the concentration and focus I need in the gym without a heavy crash. The fruit punch flavor is pretty good. Tastes like any other fruit punch. The only issue I have is that it mixes terribly. I'm on probably my 10th tub and they all mix bad. When I asked BPI why, I was told its just how the ingredients break down. \n",
      "I will definitely continue buying and recommend to friends like I have been. \n",
      "Great preworkout, always helped get through tough workouts. \n",
      "Flavor is great but seems like product needs alittle more pick me up!\n",
      "Took a while off from pre workout supps and needed somwthing extra again. I was referred by a friend to try 1.M.R. vortex and was not disappointed. My workouts are usually no longer than 90 minutes and even after that i still felt like i could hit it as hard as my first set for another 2 hours. This product got me back into the gym in the mornings and has since been my go to pre workout. I don't think anything can compare right now. Even the products ive tried in the past that i thought were decent come no where close to what the product can help you achieve during your training sessions in the gym. Looking foward to trying the snowcone and sour watermelon flavors!\n",
      "ive tried other pre-workouts like C4 and No Bull, but this pre-workout is by far the best I've taken. I definitely notice a difference in focus and strength when I take this. Since my caffeine tolerance is sorta high, I take about a scoop and a half right before I leave to the gym which is 30 mins away. The flavor is great, fruit punch is my favorite, Snow Cone flavor has a bit of a sour blue raspberry type of taste. You do get a bit of an itchy feeling from the Beta-Alanine, but I don't mind that. Overall I'd say it's worth a try if you need a boost for the gym after work, like me, or if you just need more intensity and focus.\n",
      "Very great product. I've tried other pre-workouts, but nothing has the same edge as BPI 1.M.R. The flavors are right on point (snow cone and Blue rasp are my favorites), and I feel focused and energized without the crash and burn afterwards. I highly recommend taking this pre or intra-workout for the extra kick..or the \"1 more rep\" as they call it. Great product that won't kick the bank, but will help kick the weights!\n",
      "This gave me a pump and made my workout go better. I have been lifting for over 20 years and this product is at the top of my list. Since I have a sensitive stomach I can't take alot of pre workouts without some sort of stomach issue. 1 MR doesn't give me any issues and also helps fuel my workouts! Keep up the excellent work\n",
      "This is one of the best pre workout I have ever taken to be honest! I am not telling you this because I wanted to win the prize but it's seriously the best product I experience so far and top of your other products I take along with this pre workout is Best Creatine, B4 and BCAA gives me unbelivable energy and after workout I take either the Best Protein or the Whey HD which I have both. BPI is the only products I used now since your new launch a few months ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thumbs Up :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks,\n",
      "KC\n",
      "I have taste many pro workouts and few are so strong like VORTEX, when was the start of VORTEX, I say: \"i want it\", for feel the push that many people spoken, like JAY!! and finally i do it, and is awesome!!, is totally energetic, am pushed to a great workout without tired me, am like a motor, a robot, just training and training to finish, my perfomance increase drastically, the intensity of training has improved, thanks BPI, thank VORTEX!!\n",
      "BPI's 1.M.R. Vortex is by far the best preworkout supplement I have ever taken. I have tried countless preworkouts before and always find myself going back to the 1.M.R. Vortex. Not only does it power you through the longest and toughest workouts, but it tastes amazing, too! Since 1.M.R. drastically exceeded my expectations, I will only use BPI products because of the success and results I've been able to achieve! If there was a fantasy draft for preworkouts, 1.M.R. would definitely be the number one pick!\n",
      "Mixed great stayed mixed not over powering taste. Medium rush. Looking for bigger. But good focus! So had a sample of snow cone was one of the best tasting pre drinks I think i have had now! \n",
      "One if the better pre workouts I have used. No jitters, no crashes, no itchy skin. Helps with lactic acid build and I notice a but more of a pump while hitting the weights. Tastes great, most likely to buy again. I think that My body is just so used to caffiene that I never get that caffiene boost anymore \n",
      "didn't feel much of a difference.\n",
      "I took this before an intense leg day and it gave me a slight boost but not like I feel when I take MVP Fuel.  It was good boost but not over the top and the best part--NO TINGLE!!  Still going strong a few hours later.  I recommend if you're looking for a pre-workout with no tingle.  \n",
      "My Man Mr James Grage, don't have the slightest clue But I was literally Out Of This World this  Vortex had me Super Human I felt like a SuperHero, I still got ways to go to get to that Leam Body that I've been searching for many years I've lost 105lbs from 297lbs to 192lbs & at age 49 will be 50 in May I sure hope that I can accomplish this Journey. I Love your Products have used besides the 1.M.R Vortex, Best BCAA, & Whey HD keep it coming & my Journey will soon Come, Big Ups BPI. \n",
      "Great caffeine kick when I need it before a lift!  and no added creatine\n",
      "This product is sneaky good. By that I mean when it kicks in you're not jittery, BUT you have this quiet feeling of  \"I'm ready to smash everything!\" Exactly what I want from my pre-workout. I don't want to be geek-ed out, but I want a nudge to get my workout started with explosiveness. This one got a 9 because it doesn't mix as well as the Best BCAA. It leaves chunks even in the best of shakers. Other than that, great product. This and Best BCAA are my 1-2 punch for workouts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent! Explosive energy and taste greate! \n",
      "Best PW great long lasting energy\n",
      "I have been taking 1MR vortex for about 2 weeks now. From all the pre workouts vortex has to be one of the best to get me started and ready to start lifting. This is great, downfall is that vortex doesn't last long. Powerful punch for my first 30 mins or so then it is a crash like hitting a brick wall. Energy is depleted, lack of getting a big pump and having to take 2 scoops unlike the other pre workouts I usually only need one and I am good for hours. Yet their is something special about it, don't know what it is because it taste like chalk with a foam that builds up after shaking it. The energy boost is great and mixing it with something with a pump builder makes this awesome. I end up mixing assault with vortex to give me some of the best workouts. Since vortex doesn't last ask long or stay in the system for hours it's nice to just relax after a lift then being hopped up not being able to sleep or nap. Overall it's good, just not great and the taste could use improvement. \n",
      "This is honestly the best preworkout on the market right now, and I've tried many of them. For the money, it's the best balance of all the preworkout ingredients you need. I use about 1.5 scoops and it lasts me a good month. Takes a minute to kick in, some are quicker than others, but 1MR has a good 10-15 min affect on me. The taste is also really good, not quite C4 taste, but it works better than C4, and you can take less. \n",
      "This does exactly what a preworkout is supposed to do.  And it was buy 1 get 1 free.  Bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor:  Snow-cone sample was WAY too sweet.  Blueberry Lemon Ice is awesome and Sour Watermelon is pretty good too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mix-ability:  It mixes pretty well but I noticed with sour watermelon gets some chunks at first, but they dissolve eventually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:  Very simple.  I like this.  Skin-ripping pumps and vein swelling hulk arms don't come from a preworkou.  It comes from good hydration and training hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pump: If anyone tells you its not good its because they are training dehydrated or not training.  I have never experienced a weak pump with any preworkout, or without one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy/focus:  I spend all day focusing on work and a little boost before the gym is always good.  This is where preworkouts actually benefit.  Caffeine! From my understanding this has 200 mg of caffeine which is PLENTY.  I read reviews that some guys took 3 scoops before feeling anything.  600 mg.  That is beyond unhealthy.  I took the 2 scoop sample and I felt AWFUL, as if my chest were going to explode.  If you need more than 200 mg of caffeine, DON'T take another scoop, and don't buy a stronger preworkout or any garbage like that.  Stop using it for a month and do some cardio or something because your resting heart rate is probably 95 bpm and you need to probably need to hook up to a car battery to get a caffeine buzz at this point.  Get off of the preworkout for a little bit.  I can assure you that your tolerance and expectations are the problem not the preworkout.\n",
      "Flavor was easy to chug down, i cut carbs a few weeks ago and this preworkout really helped when my energy felt depleted. nothing godly but  it gets the job done. \n",
      "Pump HD was my favorite. Until I tried 1.M.R Vortex that became #1. Incredible  energy for my workouts, don't  want  to stop but have to go home. \n",
      "Can't stand the sour watermelon taste, but it gives me the boost i need to start my workouts. I forgot my shaker today and ended up not taking it and man I sure felt a difference, worst workout I've had since I started using this!\n",
      "The greatest pre workout ever used to date. It gives me the best workout and pump. I've been doing the hiit 100s program and honestly say I couldn't do it without the vortex. Does keep me focused very well. Great product when stacked with b4 and best bcaa. Love the flavor as well. Bought 3 month supply.\n",
      "One of my go to pwo when I'm in need of a lift. Gives great energy, focus and pump. Highly recommend it as this will make you want to stay in the gym for hours. It is very cost effective as it has lots of servings and it also has great flavors to choose from, my personal favorite out of all of them is snow cone. I don't know how it can be rated so low but it is what it is. \n",
      "First off I love BPI products. The whey HD and the original 1.M.R. are outstanding products. You can't go wrong with purchasing any of there products. However vortex does not live up to the original as I had hoped. I tried this product and it performed great, but not as potent as the original. For anyone looking for a solid pre workout to get you through an intense time at the gym then this is  a great choice. \n",
      "This is by far my most favorite pre-workout to use. However my system has gotten so used it so Im currently trying other pre workouts but dont you worry, I will definitely be buying this again. I have tried other flavors from this brand but nothing compares to the Sour Watermelon. NAILED IT!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Good pump and good energy for my whole workout. Maybe it's just me, but I hated the taste. Workout level was awesome, just didn't taste well\n",
      "This is the switch to beast mode harder i workout the more intese my workout gets SIMPLY the best\n",
      "This product gave me a great pre workout kick! That tingling feel was real but not overwhelming. I would recommend this product to anyone else!\n",
      "Excellent product! Great flavor great taste and gets me pumped for every workout! Definitely have recommended this product to fellow gym goers!\n",
      "Great taste, mixes easily........good pre-workout energy and pump. Wish there were other flavor options available. Fruit punch is a solid flavor...no aftertaste and good overall flavor. My new favorite flavor is the sour watermelon.....Great Taste!!\n",
      "The Vortex 1MR gives me the power charge I need to push through my workouts. I notice I have more energy, endurance and able to focus more when I use this Preworkout. It also tastes delicious and is very easy to digest on my stomach. I highly recommend trying this product to enhance your workout. \n",
      "Do u remember the first time you felt in love ? Or  that feeling when u had the first kiss ... or when you got a degree ... or just when u just did one more repeat  in the leg day ... well that  is what Vortex  has done with me . It is just incredible u  are like  goku when he is super sayayin 4 ... ☺ or  when the rock fight agains toretto at  fast five  \n",
      "... you feel  the power  you feel the blood filling your veins and your muscles going bigger .. and guess what ?   The taste its awesome  I have tried fruit punch and it is just like you are drinking fresh fruit .. awesome ... good product good company .. just #bepowerfull ... greatings from Ec ..  #IwantVortex\n",
      "I got a 1 serving sample of the 1.M.R vortex, snow cone a little while back. The directions said to only use half at one time to assess your tolerance, so I did that. I didn't often use a pre workout, but now I do. The snow cone is an amazing flavor, it tastes juste like cotton candy from a carnival. It's definitely sweet, but not too sweet for me and it doesn't have a chalky texture to it like most other powders. Since I loved it so much I came here and bought 2 bottles for a very good price. I mix one scoop in a plastic water bottle with about 16oz of water about 20 minutes before I work out. 1.M.R vortex gives me a great pump, makes me look more vascular during training and keeps me energized long after my workout. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of 10 is because I've had some trouble getting it all to mix thoroughly. It seems that theres always a little that will collect at the bottom of my water bottle, but this could be because I'm just using a regular bottle, not a shaker. Overall this is another great product from BPI. I can't wait to see what they come out with next.\n",
      "not the greatest pre workout I've ever had, but for the price not bad. got my heart rate up a little higher than what I like but gave me endurance.. didn't feel the focus I've gotten from other pre workouts although those have usually cost a good bit more.\n",
      "I would have given this a 10 if you had not switched up the formula but since you've switched the formula the powder does not mix as quickly and I usually have granules in the bottle when I am done but I still prefer this over the other pre-workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "First time using pre-workout powder and this one is fantastic.  Great tasting and easy to digest.\n",
      "There are a lot of mixed reviews on this product, but I for one am a HUGE fan. I switched from NO Xplode to this and am glad I did. The energy from this product is far more sustained than anything I've used; everything else hits you with an energy hammer that makes your eyes shoot open at the start and leaves you crashing by the end of your workout, whereas this has me sustained through the entirety of my workout. And the Snow Cone flavor tastes like cotton candy. The mixibility isn't fantastic, but that's fine with me for such a solid product.\n",
      "Laser focus, high energy and decent pumps at a price point that can't be beat for the effectiveness of this pre. Enough said!\n",
      "I've been using this product for about 6 months on and off. I've gained somewhat of a tolerance towards it but overall it still works pretty well. Other pre-workouts I've tried have made me nauseous/lightheaded/etc. but I've found 1MR Vortex gives me a good boost of energy and definitely makes a difference in my workouts. I've only tried the blueberry lemon ice flavor and it's not the best. Mixability is pretty poor and I find it to be sour. It's definitely not the worst flavor I've tried but I don't enjoy it.\n",
      "I really enjoyed these flavors! Taste wise, I really enjoyed them. They may be too sour for some people, though.\n",
      "For energy, I feel a great pump and it lasts me through my whole workout. \n",
      "For mix ability, it did not mix all the way when I used a mixer ball, and also tried manually stirring it with a spoon. There was some granularity to the mix no matter how I mixed it.\n",
      "Straight to the point:  I didn't really see much of a difference taking this before my workouts as opposed to not.  It gave me a little 'nervous' energy that hit me 2 hours later.  I didn't see an immediate increase in energy or performance from this product during my workout.  Maybe it just didn't work for me for some reason, perhaps not super sensitive to caffeine?  I'm getting 20 mg of Niacin via my vitamin, so maybe that's why I don't respond to this?  I'm not sure.  The flavor is good and my co-workers use this product.   I wished I could feel a difference during my workouts, but I don't so I won't use it again.  Hope it works for others.\n",
      "Focus; Yes\n",
      "Energy: Not really\n",
      "Flavor: taste is good, but nothing special.  \n",
      "BUY: If you're looking to have that zoned out/tunnel vision effect in the gym, or something to maintain your energy level during a longer workout. \n",
      "DONT BUY:  If you're looking for something to provide you with extra energy on a sluggish day, this will not snap you out of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this only because it was on sale for a great price. I'll finish both my bottles, but probably won't ever buy it again. I prefer the energy boost of other supplements. \n",
      "Taste great before my morning workouts and gives me more energy\n",
      "This was my first time trying this brand and i'm pretty happy with it so far. The energy is a good clean pump, it hasn't upset my stomach yet... Not extremely powerful like mr.hyde, but i think the Energy:Taste ratio is one of the best. Watermelon tastes like watermelon bubblegum with no weird aftertaste, and the snow cone flavor is pretty much identical to grabbing a handful of skittles and hucking them in your mouth.\n",
      "It did not really give me a good pump nor stimulate me, It also made me feel kind of nautiuos after awhile.\n",
      "One of my favorite pre-workouts!!! I switch with Pump - HD. \n",
      "Talk about an energy booster! It kicks in on an empty stomach at about 15 minutes. 30 minutes on a full stomach. (for both my 5'3\" 140 lb  frame as well as my brother's 6'3\" 210lb frame). The energy lasted long into our lift and was the perfect boost for our cardio days. I saw improvement in my strength. I would highly recommend this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the Snow Cone and Blue Raspberry taste great! Make sure you have a shaker ball to break up the powder in the cup better!\n",
      "This product gave me a lot of mental focus and energy in the gym. I used half of a sample packet, (1 serving) and had absolutely no problems. The taste was pretty good as well.\n",
      "The energy I get from this supplement is okay. The directions say to take it 15 to 30 minutes before a workout. However, even when following the directions I don't feel anything until halfway through my workout which would be about an hour after I take it. When it finally does kick in I'll get a short burst of energy where I can really feel it working. After that I start to feel a little bit of a lag. I was kind of hoping to feel the effects longer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, this product doesn't mix very well. I put the one scoop with water in a shaker bottle. Even after shaking it up for 30 seconds, I still get little chunks of powder left and a lot of foam at the top.  The flavor is pretty good so that might be one good thing about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try it once and see if it affects you the same way. It was a good buy price-wise, I got it with a buy one get one free deal.\n",
      "This preworkout  does not mix well at all. Taste is very bitter and you can taste chemicals. As far as energized it is so-so. I've had much better products. \n",
      "it taste ok, to sweet for me. But when it hits you during your workout, you'll know because you'll go 0-100 real quick. I love it. \n",
      "I first used the two serving sample of 1.M.R Vortex, and like many others, I used the whole thing in one go, and got pretty queasy.  But before I almost puked, it felt great; I was more focused and moved from set to set with minimal rest time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the 30 serving container of the snow cone flavor (tastes like a very sweet blue raspberry icee).  One scoop is enough to get full effect, unlike C4 or ENGN which required 3 scoops, and I feel energized and focused with no jitters.  The one harmless negative I've noticed is that 1.M.R Vortex makes me sweat twice as much as I normally would.  I feel like I need a banana mid workout so I don't cramp up.\n",
      "Great preworkout! I bought this with beta alanine and it has given me great energy for my workouts! This product tastes phenomenal. \n",
      "Great product, good boost--not too much, not too little.  Gives you the little nudge to get you in the gym and the other nudge to keep you there.  Just make sure that you take it within a month of buying or else it will get hard and clump up.  Hope this helps.\n",
      "My new favorite pre workout. Great value, good energy,pump,focus and the best tasting pre workout I have ever tasted. \n",
      "Tastes good but not as potent as others I've had before.  Not my preferred and I ended up giving the rest of this away.\n",
      "This is one of the worst pre work outs I've ever had.  It does not mix well at all.  It was extremely chunky.  It gave my no rush or energy at all. I would never recommend this product to anyone.\n",
      "Is really powerful,you see the reaction within 15 mins...and then you're a beast at the gym\n",
      "This is one of the best Pre Workout in the market make you like Hulk and very delecious Flavors .\n",
      "i bought this as i gotten a sample in M&F Jacked-in-a-box. this is by far my favorite pre-workout drink. i also took the Arnold series Iron Pump pre-workout and while that gives me the pump, 1mr keeps me going. my only complaint, is that sometimes the powder doesn't dissolves completely and you taste the powder so that doesn't get annoying and gross sometimes, but other than that this is a really good pre-workout and tastes great! i take two scoops of this to get going.\n",
      "I generally never liked taking pre workouts because of the beta alanine ingredient which I don't like the feeling of. This product doesn't contain it so I was immediately sold on that aspect (aside that BPI is my favorite sup brand) It helps me focus on my workouts and pump through all my reps and sets. The flavor is amazing I can't wait to try the rest!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not my favorite. This did not dissolve well in water and rather weak intensity wise. \n",
      "Taste is awesome, mixes very well. Can't beat the serving size for the price. I have noticed a great improvement in my energy levels, focus, and when my body start's saying I am done my mind takes it to that 1 more rep. stage. Defiantly a amazing product that I will continue to use. \n",
      "This is the first pre-workout that I've ever used that had zero effect on my workout. I've been lifting for more than a decade and taking pre-workouts for most of it. Through all my years of taking supplements I have never before taken more than one scoop or pre-workout at a time so it can't be said that I've built strong tolerance. I started with one scoop so I could get the feel of it and after feeling nothing I decided to go for another scoop. I felt no extra pump, no extra energy and no benefits in my ability to stay focused. The only reason I'm not giving this product a 1 is because the flavor was good.\n",
      "Very best tasting pre wo I've ever had! I'm use to high stimulant pre wo. This one is a great one without the jitters . Seems as it's low on stimulant but great pump and energy. I only use about 2-3 oz of water to mix. I also throw in my creatine and it all mixes well. Over all ... Get this product! \n",
      "Seems to be a good pre-workout; it does not leave me jittery and I am always ready to go in the gym. But it mixes so poorly, I have never seen a clumpier pre-workout. \n",
      "   This product has great reviews and so I was excited to try this brand out. I caught it on sale buy two get one free. I have taken this product several times and it has not done anything for me at all. I'm usually pretty lenient on products but seriously as far as energy or focus it did absolutely nothing. I really wanted to like this product but it's a no go. Now I have all of this product and no desire to use it hah. \n",
      "\n",
      "   Now as far as the flavor goes it is pretty good for a pre workout. In the last two to three years I've just come to realize pre-workout don't taste good as a general rule so I don't expect it. The Sour Watermelon was pretty good. The rating it has is from taste only really. \n",
      "   \n",
      "The sour watermelon is my favorite out of all the flavors but not as flavorful as C4 so less water is necessary to mix with. It does, however, give me an awesome energy level at the gym that feels natural and does not leave me shaky or nauseous like other preworkouts I have tried.\n",
      "I have been achieving excellent results using 1 m.r. in the gym. My workouts have gone to the next level. The flavor is awesome as well. \n",
      "Great energy just wish it had some creatine and beta alanine. Overall really good pre workout\n",
      "powerful.  strong.  invincible.  euphoria  =  two scoops.  \n",
      "\n",
      "everything bpi sports claims you may xperience were true:  increased strength, unstoppable energy, enhanced performance.    \n",
      "The 1.M.R. Vortex was the product I was most excited about when I would see the coming soon videos with Jay Cutler at the BPI HQ. when it came out it did not disappoint. It gave me a great pump and even better energy boost without that crash that comes with many per workouts. Was not tough on my stomach at all which is big for me as I don't like having my stomach rumbling all day. It mixed great and tasted very good. Honestly kinda like cool aid. Like a sweet candy drink. This product got me sweating and def helped me burn some fat and push me to that next level that I needed to get to. I highly recommend this product to anyone. It's part of my stack since it came out and will remain there. \n",
      "I think this new formula is on point! Gave me a on last pump throughout my workout, it keep me with a great pump long after I was done! And I didn't have a crash later on. I'm a fan!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1.M.R. Vortex is a fantastic product! I love everything about it because it gives me the boost I need on those days that my normal energy is not up to par. It gives me great energy and allows me to get through any workout. I will be buying this product as long as it is on the shelves! I love BPI Sports and I stand by their products 100%. The flavors are amazing, they mix easily and taste great!\n",
      "1 MR Vortex is arguably my favorite preworkout. Taste of blueberry lemon ice is phenomenal. The energy is great and I get an awesome pump after taking it. The price is also great coming from a broke college student. \n",
      "I'll keep it short and sweet. I had to take 4 scoops to feel anything. The fruit punch tasted gross, but the sour watermelon tasted amazing. Save your money buy something stronger. \n",
      "The product gives a great pump I take 20-30 pre workout and as soon as I hit the gym I'm ready to hit whatever muscle I'm working that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the flavor! great pups. however it wears off fast on me.\n",
      "I was always a c4 user and once this product hit the market I have never looked back.  I get up at 115 am for work and without this product I wouldn't be able to push through\n",
      "Great product!  Flavor is not bad, easy enough to swallow.  I am able to maintain focus and drive through my hour long sessions.  I don't get jittery at all but it will keep you awake if you take it in the evening.  Get a decent pump, too.\n",
      "Mixed ok but its hard to take down with water after the first few sips, gets powerful. I take it on heavy days and it gets me from ready to fall asleep to a little better than normal. I would possibly recommend it to a friend.\n",
      "Was excited to try this but it turned out to be quite disappointing.  It does not mix well, the taste is pretty horrible and it failed to give me any boost.  \n",
      "Had little or no positive effect.  \n",
      "Fantastic product.  Taste was fantastic and I loved the energy and pumps.  If it was a regular day, 1 scoop of this product was perfect energy and pump.  I was always focused in the gym.  If it was a struggle of a day and I needed a bit extra Uumph, 2 scoops was killer.  Seemed like the perfect amount of agmatine, caffeine, and other ingredients to really dial in and murder a workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Didn't have any effect\n",
      "My impression on the 1MR Vortex was just good. I was expecting more based on the sample I tried before. Even thought the product is good and gave me good work out sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good product, about half way through my first order of it. The sour watermelon flavor is a little weak and doesn't mix well with the 6-8 oz of water. I feel like I'm am over watering it but still get pumped and more focused on my workout. Bottom line not the best pre workout I have ever used but I would continue to use it and purchase more.\n",
      "They taste incredible... Like to a point where I loved drinking them but that was it. This preworkout ended at taste. I felt no pump no energy and no focus. Horrible preworkout. I've tried tons of preworkout powders and this was the WORST. I've taken 5 scoops and still barely felt it. I bought it on super sale and I still regret it. DO NOT BUY THIS PREWORKOUT!\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't give you the tingles which I like. Gives you a good amount of focus. It doesn't just hit you its more gradual atleast for me. But it make you just want to work out. I find that when I use it I want to put on the extra 5 or 10 pounds to the bar and actually push myself to get one more rep. Overall great pre-workout that I would buy again. Oh and the taste is not the greatest but drinkable it's not unbearable. \n",
      "This is the most inferior pre-workout product that i have ever taken. Not only does this product lack that vital ingredients that give help build muscle it also is not a great energy source. Moreover, a real pre-workout contains these five ingredients: creatine, beta alanine, betaine, caffeine,  and sodium bicarbonate. A pre-workout needs these ingredients do to the fact that they all help your muscles contract harder and stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid preworkout. No jitters or crash but with that you also don't experience any extreme or noticeable rush.\n",
      "Doesn't mix well. I feel like the original make was better. I probably won't be using this again. Didn't really feel anything.\n",
      "It definitely does it's job but there's not much in it besides caffeine. The taste is good if you love blueberries, great if you love lemonade. Based on the profiles/tastes of other PWOs I've had since trying this I can't see myself buying this again\n",
      "This is a really good product. It gets me hyped before every workout and I get a really good pump from it. I don't think the taste is so great, but who really cares about that anyways?.. I like it. It gets the job done. \n",
      "Started taking this about 8 weeks ago. I have found 1MR Vortex to provide better results than NOExplode, C4, HemaVol, and Assault. The taste is great! Mixes well. The focus is insane! I am able to push through tough workouts and still feel like I'm ready for more. I am caffeine sensitive so 5-10mins after taking it makes me B.M. which is fine with me. Careful when taking 3 scoops if you are sensitive to Niacin. The flushing effect is uncomfortable due to 20mg per serving of Niacin.  I feel two scoops works best for me. \n",
      "I'm kinda disappointed in this product. I tried the sample pack and liked it. Ordered a tub and it is almost like it wasn't the same product that was in the sample pack. No where near the same energy or pump. Had to take 3 scoops to really feel the effect of the preworkout. Taste good though. \n",
      "I placed my order yesterday at 7 pm and got it today at 4 pm with just standard shipping. I brought the Blueberry Lemon Ice last month, this time I got Sour Watermelon and Fruit Punch, I hope they taste good.\n",
      "JUST AWESOME TO SMASH GYM !!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "TAKING 20 MIN PRIOR WORKOUT I GET PUMP JUST GO AND PUSH MY LIMITS  THANKS BPI \n",
      "TASTES GREAT :-) \n",

      "Flavor is pretty good, and I like that you don't have to mix it with a ton of water.  I typically work out first thing in the morning, and I don't notice THAT much increased energy.  It was included in a stack I purchased.  I don't think I'll purchase again.  \n",
      "I received a sample pack of this, then ordered the product. The taste is not great, but I'm not a fan of how any pre workout tastes. It does the job I use it for. Great focus and energy. Hasn't given me any side effects other than becoming beat red mid workout. \n",
      "Love this pre-workout! Personally, I don't like the beta alanine tingly feeling, and Vortex doesn't have that. It gives me good focus and gets me pumped up for the gym without the tingles and jitters! \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried 1.M.R. In the past and felt it was a decent pre workout with a good bang for your buck. I decided to try  1.M.R. Vortex based on my past experience with their products. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.M.R. Vortex however has failed to meet expectations. I noticed very little \"pump\" from the product, even with increased doses. As others have mentioned,  the flavor is fair (at best) and the product mixes very poorly. 1.M.R. Vortex seems like it needs additional R&D before being something I would use or recommend. \n",
      "The 1 MR is awesome.  It does not make me all scatterbrained like some other products do.  I enjoy the blue lemon ice flavor too.  The product does not make me itchy (niacin) or bloat my stomach (magnesium).  I find some preworkouts I can not take when I am doing HIT style training because they upset my stomach too much, this is not the case with 1MR.  \n",
      "Does what it says but tastes awful\n",
      "Got a free sample. Liked it. Bought the tub of it. I use it before every workout. I'm a heavy coffee drinker and I have had no side effects.  And I definitely feel better when I use it. I got some gas in the tank at the end of my workout.\n",
      "\n",
      " I'll buy it again. \n",
      "I fell in love with Fruit Punch, not just the taste but the mixability, and jolt of energy it produced for me, thought I would switch it up to Blueberry Lemon Ice.........very disappointed in it, tons of floaters left, that are un-mixable no matter how hard it is shaken, and it just didn't seem to have the KICK that Fruit Punch did for me..........I hope they didn't change the recipe again and downgrade an incredible product..........going to give the Lemon Ice away to a friend and buy some more Fruit Punch.......fingers crossed ! \n",
      "I am a big fan of beta-alanine, which is why I rated this so low. It lacks the tingling feeling which motivates me. I feel more focused but I would like to feel it a little more. It isn't very potent so don't be afraid to use 2-3 scoops. \n",
      "Used 1 MR for a long time great product. This however not good at all. It hardly mixes with most of it stuck to glass and rest in small lumps floating around. Makes you jittery. Sticking to 1 MR.\n",
      "So far so good. It taste great and it gives me a good pump to workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the guys I'm deployed with had a sample pack and he told me to try it. I had the Fruit Punch flavor which had a pretty good taste. I took it like 20 minutes before my workout and when I started my work out, I had a lot of energy and I felt more motivated and intense. I had to order this and I bought The Blueberry Lemon Ice, but this flavor has a weird taste. I have to say, its good to take for a pre-workout and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have that extra energy in the gym!\n",
      "1st time trying this pre. Gives a decent amount of energy. For me lacking in intensity. Not bad for the price. \n",
      "I just finished an absolutely rock solid leg workout thanks to 1MR Vortex.  I pushed myself and had no weird side effects (redness or headaches).  The taste leaves a bit to be desired.  Overall well worth the money!  \n",
      "This is one of the best pre-workout drinks I have used. What I immediately noticed was a great feeling of focus and alertness with no jitters. The energy lasted for hours after the workout without crashing. I recommend using this product on an empty stomach as the label says and waiting a while to eat after your workout. \n",
      "I almost don't want to review these products yet. I've only gone through a week of workouts with it. I really like the tastes for both. They are both a little sour but drink very easily. The energy and focus is great but a little more pump could be used. Mixes well but not fully. Some particulates floating around. And slight head if mixed in a vortex glass. But so far better than the other pre-workouts that I have tried.\n",
      "My tolerance to pre-workouts is pretty high. I tried this product after having a really good experience with the original 1 m.r... Unfortunately, this version did not have the same effect. I need to take 3 scoops (1 over the recommended) in order to feel like it's working. I will be going back to the plain 1 m.r.\n",
      "The only good that i can say about this product is the flavor...is really tasty. Despite that, the overall of this product performance is very poor... Not only the solubility of the powder is bad, also the purpose. i can not feel any change in my workput at all (even after finish all three containers x 21grams that i buyed)\n",
      "\n",
      "this is one of my favorite product...this give me many energy...\n",
      "\n",
      "This product did not work for me. Hyped to be a Powerful Pre Workout Supp, I could not feel much from this at two scoops. \n",
      " I have been weighting for over 30 years and have tried alot of products, but this was a big let down.\n",
      "I bought this expecting more. Granted I have a high tolerance for stimulants, I took this 1 scoop, didn't feel anything, 2,3,4 scoops and effects were minimal. Added caffeine pill 200 mg. And had a decent workout with 5 scoops, MAYBE GOOD FOR SOMEONE WITH LOW TOLERANCE, otherwise, money better spent elsewhere\n",
      "This pre-workout was the best for me so far. I've tried Pre-, C4, N.O Explode & Pump 4D. All products had some large Con to them that drew me away from the product. 1MR does not have a lingering con. The taste is fine, easier to disgust & the performance in the gym is a noticeable plus. I recommend this product for those weighing this vs other Preworkout supps. \n",
      "Great pump. Have tried many pre-workout supplements and this one is one of the better ones. I like the lower dosage of caffeine, Huge plus++. I don't need the equivalent of 4-6 cups of coffee to workout. Also like how there's no creatine in this, as I'm taking creatine already. No need to measure dosages offset by many other pre-workouts. Would definitely like to try another flavor though, not a terrible taste, but have def had better tasting pre-workouts. Going to try the Blueberry Lemon Ice, I like blue stuff better than red so it's my own fault :P.\n",
      "Great stuff. Tried some others and came back. Love it.\n",
      "\"Buy 2 7-scoop tubs, get one free\" deal attracted me to the 21 scoops for $13.98. Great value. Also had heard great things about the original 1MR. Value was 10/10, although I sometimes felt the need to take 2 scoops, which set my supply back rather quickly. Taste is 10/10. Fruit punch is delicious, mixes great. Effectiveness: 7/10. I give it a 7 out of 10 because I have had workouts with 1MR Vortex that were intense, focused, and energetic - but I also had several where I felt extremely unfocused and had no pump. Even one where I left after 30 mins because I felt absolutely unmotivated w/2 scoops. Kind of dodgy pre, seems to be hit or miss. Not bad at all, but there you can DEFINITELY find something more reliable than 1MR Vortex\n",
      "With all the good reviews on this product I thought for sure that I would be impressed with it. It was the total opposite. The first time I used it I used 1 scoop as s****ested and felt nothing, no difference at all. The following day I used 2 scoops, again nothing. I was surprised and disapointed that this product didn't live up to all the hype it's gotten. \n",
      "As far as getting the JOB done i love this product gets me through the workout still not tolerant to the product so no money is being wasted really looking forward to trying more BPI SPORTS products i love this product so much i bought 3 tubs\n",
      "\n",
      "1 MR Vortex is a great product. Helped me to have better focus and was not as powerful as the original 1 MR. Love the flavor and it mixes very well do the the small portion size. Overall Great product.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOT A FREE SAMPLE WITH MY RECENT PURCHASES......MAN WAS I SUPRISED FOR THE LAST YEAR NO PRE WORKOUT I HAVE TAKEN WOULD WORK ANYMORE INCLUDING JACK 3D,N.O XPLODE,BULLNOX,SUPER PUMP,PUMP HD,OR EVEN C4....BUT 1MR VORTEX  DID.... ON MY WARM UP SET I GOT A EXTRA 25 PUSHUPS WITH EASE FINALLY STARTED OUR CHEST WORKOUT AND I WAS FEELING GREAT MY CONFIDENCE WAS GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER WITH EACH SET WINDED UP DOING 20LBS MORE ON INCLINE DUMBELL THAN I USUALLY DO ON FLATBENCH DUMBELL PRESS....AFTER A GOOD 2HR WORKOUT I WAS STILL ENERGIZED AND FEELING GREAT.....FRUIT PUNCH TASTES VERY WELL TO ME.....DID NOT MAKE ME RUN TO THE RESTROOM LIKE N.O X PLODE USE TO..............NEEDLESS TO SAY AFTER TRYING THAT SAMPLE PACK FROM BB I ORDERED SOME THAT NIGHT.\n",
      "I definitely like a strong pre-workout powder to kick start my workout when needed, and this one fits the bill.!!\n",
      "I liked the fruit punch flavor much better then the blueberry lemon ice...\n",
      "...hopefully they'll come out with some better flavors.\n",
      "The taste is outstanding! and that's about it. I work out 7 days a week and use this product on weight training days only. It gives some energy but isn't near as strong as others I've tried. I take two rounded scoops most time on an empty stomach and about 20 min after I down it I have enough energy to finish thru my workouts ,but as far as a pump or any kind of tingling sensation, there's none. If your new to preworkout supps this might be ok but after you've been taking them for a while you'll see what I mean.\n",
      "The best pre work out on the market!  Never had such a strong pump through out my workout.  Have only tried the fruit punch, but it tastes great.  Not an over powering flavor, mixes extremely well, and leaves no after taste.  Can't wait to try blueberry lemon ice flavor.  \n",
      "I first got a sample of this on BB.Com with my Whey Protein. I felt like I could throw a car in the gym because I took the full two servings in the sample packet. I was so impressed that I bought it that day. Got the tub, took 2 scoops again and I thought my heart was going to explode but didnt really feel energy. So the next day i took 1.5 scoops, heart felt fine but still no real energy, or pump. The only thing this does well is provide Focus. But the feeling of energy and endurance i had the first time i took it is just not there. Going back to no Pre-workout :( \n",
      "\n",
      "Very good preworkout much better than most.\n",
      "I've tried a lot of PWO drinks and confess that many make me feel like crap after training, when I crash.  But 1MR Vortex made me feel like crap during my workout.  I took 2 scoops 3ins before training and tried it 3-4 times on different weeks...same effect.  My buddy tried my tub and had same experience even though I had not told him it made me feel crappy.  I still have 1 and a half containers and I'm throwing them out.\n",
      "Only ok. \n",
      "I felt that it helped me stay focused on my workout. I would say a person would not be disapointed in this product.\n",
      "Did not live up to the hype!\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using 1M.R. For about 2 years now, and am on my 2nd tub of Vortex. The flavor is great, and it hits me pretty hard even when I take it with some food in my stomach. I only have to take a half scoop, and occasionally a full scoop on those 'low motivation' days. It's a great product, and I've recommended it to some friends. The only reason I gave it a 9/10 is due to the fact it doesn't mix easily. A shaker works fine, though. The price is pretty great too, at about 50 servings a bottle. \n",
      "After the first few times taking this the energy dropped as I expected it to because I am very tolerant of pre workouts. The energy was still there but it just wasn't ridiculous. Plenty to fuel me through a workout. Better than the energy, though, was the focus. The pump was good as well. Overall I think this is a great product for the price! I would recommend this to anyone from a beginner to an expert in the gym!\n",
      "All hype and no delivery.  Even at max dose, not much of anything.  Complete lack of focus, energy, or pump for me.  Tasted pretty good, but then again, so does Kool-Aid.   \n",
      "I started using 1MR when the first samples were being introduced.  Was very impressed with this product. The fruit punch is amazing, no carbonation and has a sweet kick to it, probably the best tasting by far. It also still gives you the pump and intensity you are looking for in your workout, but without the itch and shakes you get with other pre workouts. I am still using this product and will continue to do so. \n",
      "I have tried many preworkouts but this one is definitely top 3. You feel a rush within 10 - 15 minutes and it last at least an hour. I would honestly say this is much better then C4 and pre jym. If your looking for a long lasting product with great pumps and long lasting energy, THIS IS THE ONE.\n",
      "Good clean energy.  Not over the top jittery energy, but still noticeable.  Good price for the amount of servings and for a major product brand.  Would buy again!\n",
      "I have been using pre workouts since last 5 years and was getting used to all other major brands like Superpump, Jacked, BSN. So I decided to give Vortex a try based on Jay's suggestion. I have to say this stuff is no joke, I have been using this from last 6 weeks and only 1 scoop is more than enough to give me explosive pumps during my workouts. I have also been using the Blox with it, great combo. As a result, I ordered 2 more bottles of Vortex and 3 bottles of Blox last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommended!!\n",
      "I'm rating this a 10 strictly because it gives focus like a beast on the hunt. So I mix it with something that actually gives strength to go along with it. Excellent product and great tasting. Would definitely buy this again. As you guys know, focus is everything in the gym. Even more so than power and strength. \n",
      "First off, not many Pre's do anything to me anyways. However, like a idiot...I wish I would've checked the ingredient list first, this one is crap!!! Do not waste your money! There was no energy, and nothing else in it to make it any better. I do love other bpi products, but DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!\n",
      "It packs a punch and gives great energy.\n",

      "\n",

      "No more energy\n",
      "No more strenght\n",
      "Same performance\n",
      "I have taken a lot of preworkouts and this is probably my least favorite that I've ever taken. It really did not give me much of a pump, it was short lived, and to take enough to get any sort of a pump it made me feel nauseous. I really liked the original 1MR but this stuff was terrible. Quit using it half way through the bottle because I threw up from feeling nauseous from it, which had never happened to me. I have no idea why it got a high rating on here, but I'll never take it again. \n",
      "I was excited to try the new 1MR Vortex after seeing all the ads & hearing all the hype. I was incredibly disappointed to find that hype is all that's in the container. The instructions are very explicit in using only a single scoop to assess tolerance because it's \"so powerful\". This did absolutely nothing for me, no energy, no motivation, no focus. I shared the container with my training partner & her experience was the same, it did nothing for her were her exact words. I'm an experienced pre workout stimulant user & feel very misled by the advertising for Vortex. It seems like BPI is headed downhill with most of the products they've been releasing lately. Blox, the Alkaline line, now this. Most of what they are putting out seems gimmicky\n",
      "Great product! I have tried lots of pre workouts and hands down 1mr vortex is the one that works for me,  great clean energy and focus and for the price it can't be beat \n",
      "Felt absolutely NOTHING when taking 1, 1 1/2, and 2 scoops on different occasions! Flavor is ok but it does not mix well and clumps like crazy when trying to mix. Wife took it as well and no results, will stick with the old 1MR as I was disappointed in this product big time!!!\n",
      "This product is awesome gives me focus and energy through my entire workout. Mixes well and taste great.  If you never tried a pre-workout before just go with vortex\n",
      "This product did not work for me at all, but everyone is different so not all products work the same for everyone. flavor is good but thats it. BPI Pump HD blows this away by far.\n",
      "This Pre-workout is pretty good. Probably one of the best since Craze's discontinuation. :( Good Energy, alright blood flow, and decent focus. Overall a good Pre-workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Warning: For your first use only use ONE scoop, or you may face very scary consequences.\n",
      "Decent pump and focus. Taste sucks and does not mix well. After taking NO 2.0 for a while it was a good change. \n",
      "Absolute junk!!!!  There was no kick at all, taking 1, 2, even 3 scoops!!  I even stopped taking it for a week and went back and still no effect.  On top of this, this product would not mix into water.  About half of it would turn the water red and the other half floated on top, so you basically had to eat the unmixed powder to hope to try and get the full effect.  I've used 1.M.R before and had great results, but never this again.  Even if it was free!!!!\n",
      "I was very disappointed in this product.  I felt absolutely no kick.  While I can't be sure this product is to blame, about an hour after taking it I feel light headed and on the verge of passing out.  I've taken 5 servings and don't plan on using the rest.  \n",
      "It's really good, but a little too much for me.  After my 2nd set doing shoulder press I had a mini panic attack lol. But im going to use half scoops for like 2 weeks to get use to it a little before doing a whole serving.  But made me want to attack the weights, just my heart was pounding too much for my liking.  Good pumps and once the huge intensity wore off a little I had good energy for my 2 hour workout.\n",
      "Even though the flavor was ok. It was hard to mix. \n",
      "It would settle at the bottom. No matter how much water\n",
      "I added it would always settle at the bottom. \n",
      "So it's like drinking a fruit punch bottle of water\n",
      "only to get to the bottom of sludge. So I tried the drink, swirl the bottle to \n",
      "mix technique only to have to drink it in what could \n",
      "only be described as a tornado of clumps. And I started \n",
      "at the one scoop. Nothing. Several days later, two scoops,\n",
      "didn't feel anything really. I did a lot of upper and lower work \n",
      "To get that crazy pump. Only to not. Which sucks cause BPI \n",
      "usually makes a product that just knocks it out. Unfortunately \n",
      "not this time. I like their pump 4D product from the other brand \n",
      "That they produce image sports. It works better. They get it right \n",
      "With those and solid and a-hd. Just not this one. But hey live and \n",
      "Learn.   \n",
      "I was expecting a lot from this pre workout and unfortunately it hasn't lived up to the hype. I honestly run into a 50/50 situation every time I take it.  Sometimes I feel a little energy while other times I don't feel anything at all.  I took a sample of pump hd and noticed the big difference by far.  On the other hand, the taste is a 10 and it's actually the only thing I look forward to, thou mixing the scoops is horrible as little lumps start to form.  Overall, this pre workout didn't work for me and I would maybe recommend it for someone trying a pre workout for the first time...\n",
      "Tasted great, worked pretty well overall. I've gone through all the bigger name preworkouts and ive never had any kick in near as fast as vortex, it literally takes 5 minutes to kick in an the first 30 minutes are ridiculous, but it does start to wear down throughout the workout\n",
      "This product is mostly what the nutrition labels says it is.... a lot of caffeine. I felt it does a good job getting me pumped up, but doesn't assist with the longevity of some of the other pre-workouts... it doesn't contain any AAs or creatine, which seem to help my body stay in it longer. If you're looking for something to boost concentration as a couple cups of coffee might do and spend less than on other pre-workouts, this is right for you. If you're looking for something to really boost your workouts, I'd check something else out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste isn't that great, but I've had much worse.\n",
      "Read all the hype and since BPI has put out very good products decided to give 1.M.R Vortex a try.  I personally was disappointed and not satisfied with this particular product.  It was hard to get the powder to dissolve in water and I did not feel the tingling, increased energy or obtain the pump that I have read so much about.. I even increased the dosage and consumed on a empty stomach with little improvement. I get much better results from the original 1. M.R. \n",
      "Also, tried Pump-H.D. and it to was better than 1. M.R. Vortex in my opinion. I will not purchase this product again!\n",
      "Not quite the pump I expected and only mixes well when using a shaker cup. Taste was pretty good and the energy it provided was slightly better than average. \n",
      "This was one of the better preworkouts I have had in awhile. I didnt have a good first time with the original 1MR preworkout but decided to give this one a try. I really enjoyed the initial taste; kinda tasted like kool-aid; and it had none of that horrible aftertaste as other preworkouts. Gave me a clean rush of energy that I enjoyed as opposed to getting tingly sensations all over. Also I notice that I have more endurance and was able to push myself longer throughout my workouts. Overall one of the best preworkouts on the market.\n",
      " \n",
      "This tastes like crap.\n",
      "Regular 1MR tastes better. I had a feeling when I ordered it. \"Fruit Punch\"...\n",
      "This is not as strong as regular 1MR, then again my body may be used to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome, long lasting energy.\n",
      "I really liked a sample of this I took and decided to go for the big guns and make the purchase.  I try not to use pre-workouts unless I'm really dragging a** - usually on leg days (2 x a week).  I've been happy so far with the 2 times that I've taken it.  Maintains a consistent focused energy for me and does not give me the jitters or make me wonder when it's gonna wear off.  \n",
      "I have tried many preworkouts but I've never experienced a preworkout like this. Vortex (does) deliver amazing focus, intensity, energy, vascularity, and pump.  Nothing can be compared to Vortex for its quiality, price , and amount of servings. \n",
      "1Mr has worked great for me.  I usually do 2 a day's and one serving will give me the energy to work through both.  A little rough to get down a little grainy but a little bit of a bad taste was worth it.  I've taken c4 and Hyde and I like how vortex doesn't make me feel cracked out all day.\n",
      "Really liked 1mr could compare it to c4 so I will probably switch between the 2. Great pre workout supplement!\n",
      "I personally like the pump affect from other pre-workouts.  Vortex didn't offer that for me.  However, I did notice I was still energized long past my workout.  I think Vortex is better for long workouts, not so much for shorter workouts when you're looking for a quick boost.  Not a bad product, just specified for certain needs.  I do agree it does not mix well and can have a grainy texture.  The taste is ok, but I prefer others.\n",
      "Off the back, taste is amazing. It's a great pre, no skin tingles or anything. Personally for me, I couldn't tell I was getting a boost for my workout. It's overall pretty good. Wether it's working or not for me, can't tell 100%. But BPI is known for some really good products, try it out for yourself and see. \n",
      "Taken several pre workouts, none that work better than this one. Performance wise its basically all you can ask for. Good pump,  excellent focus and great endurance. ONLY bad thing in my opinion was the taste, but taste doesnt matter too much to me anyway. Solid pre workout, would recommend it. \n",
      "1.M.R. Vortex seems to me to be pretty good.  It tastes good enough (isn't hard to drink or anything) and works good.  One thing I've really noticed though, and it's on the instructions, is to try and take it on an empty stomach.  If not it seems to dampen the effects of the supplement, but when taken by itself it gives me a nice little kick.  I've used this occasionally when mtn biking as well to help me with the hill climbs.\n",
      "This is easily the worst pre-workout supplement 'I've ever taken.\n",
      "Absolutely no pump, no focus, and especially no energy.\n",
      "I've taken anywhere from one to three scoops and still absolutely nothing. \n",
      "The taste is okay but besides that I would not recommend this product.\n",
      "Not the best pre workout but it is effective.  I've only previously taken Cellucor's C4.  Vortex gets close to the power of C4, but it is not quite as good.\n",
      "This product was so hyped and did nothing for me, I could have taken water instead and not known the difference. It didn't mix all the way and sometimes felt like i was drinking tiny little bit of rocks. Also it may have 50 servings but you have to get 3-4 scoops to even feel anything. This product sucked\n",
      "Love the taste and it picks me up. I'm not really sure if it gives me real pump that some may be looking for from this product. \n",
      "Not working for me.  I get nothing from drinking this.  It tastes good that is why it gets a 3, but no energy, no pump, nothing.  Disappointed.\n",
      "Let me start out by saying that I have tried an array of pre-workout supplements dating back to when the original NO-Xplode came out and it would send chills down your spine when you twisted the cap open.\n",
      "I bought this in my search to duplicate the effects of the original jack3D, needless to say it had much to live up to. The taste is very good I will say that much for it. I just chug my pre-workouts in one gulp when i'm about 5-10minutes from the gym, this hits me usually as i'm parking or walking up the stairs. It feels like a huge rush up a mountain of energy that almost elevates you as you reach the peak. During the workouts I feel a deeper pump in my muscles and get that balloon feeling in them. I love that it doesnt give me the face tingles that other mixes do but still delivers great energy and focus and has far as crashing or coming down, I don't feel a difference. I hope they keep this blend around, its a great addition to my stash of supplements.\n",
      "I would have liked to use less of the product to get the good pump feeling. But overall gives great energy through a two hour workout. I would recommend to someone just starting training or someone that has been training for years. \n",
      "I picked up this product because I was out of my normal pre-workout & it was on sale. The reviews were fairly decent, so I thought I'd give it a try. As usual with Bodybuilding.com, everything arrived very promptly. The 1st use, I followed the instructions & just did one scoop. Honestly, I didn't notice anyth. The next day, I went with 2 scoops, thinking my overall size (6'5\" @ 270 lbs) might have something to do with it. This time around, I was able to notice quite a differe. Though, still not as much as some others I use more regularly. Since then, I do use 1 1/2 scoops before i leave for the gym, & another 1 1/2 scoops right when I get there. So far, this has given the best results. Overall, for the price, this is a pretty decent pre-workout.\n",
      "I've been taking 1MR Vortex for 3 weeks now.  First off I'd like to say the taste is amazing.  Easy to drink and no issues with aftertaste.  The only issue I've had with it, is it doesn't mix as well as other pre-workouts I've taken before.  I find myself quite often adding 2 - 3 more ounces of water to get the last bit out of the shaker bottle.  As far as results, I would have to say it gives an amazing edge to the workout.  Even on days I'm not really feeling like going to the gym, I take 1MR Vortex and within 15 minutes I'm more than ready to hit the weights.  The only problem I've had which is very very little is on some high intensity workouts after taking it I've gotten dizzy.  Overall I've enjoyed the product and will continue to purchase.  Another great product from BPI.\n",
      "I used the original 1MR before this product was announced, so I had a nice standard to compare it to. Compared to the original, Vortex definitely gave me an amazing kickstart. It gave me a ton of energy within 15-20 minutes of taking it. Vortex definitely helps me get through my tougher workouts, so I usually take in on my Back and Leg days to survive the intense workouts. The taste is a little upgraded from the original 1MR. This one I can drink over and over and not get tired of the flavor.Overall, I would say this is a really good product and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the original 1MR. I love this product and will definitely be buying it again in the near future!\n",
      "The pump is better than any Pre I have used. I most recently used the Jack3d series and 1 M.R. gives a much better pump than Jack3d Micro and Advanced. The energy kicks in fast, like in 10 minutes, its great! Plus, it lasts pretty much the whole day, and I have taken Pre workouts for like a year so that's awesome also. The taste is like watered down gatorade, so it is tough to not like it but it isn't as good tasting as others. Overall, it will be the first pre workout that I buy back to back and not switch products.\n",
      "Used two scoops and had no affects\n",
      "The only think I don't like about this product is the powder not dissolving. After shaking numerous times it had chunks, other than that complaint I love this stuff. Good pump, you can feel it kick in after 15 or so minutes. Also the focus is through the roof. I think I have finally found a pre work I like to take that doesn't give me the shakes after I use it\n",
      "\n",
      "Damien\n",
      "I've used several pre- workout powders and with this brand I had no warm feeling, tingles, or pumped feeling like I have with other brands. The taste was pretty awful to me too, it made the hair stand up on my neck! The powder also wouldn't dissolve completely so you ended up drinking small chunks; the date wasn't expired, it was shook before each use. Maybe I just had a bad container but I will never try this brand again and neither will my husband!\n",
      "Flavor is just ok, compared to the 1MR flavors...but most importantly, this product is not nearly packing as much 'punch' as 1MR did. I even tried mixing the two and don't get anywhere close to 1MR results until I'm near an 85:15 ratio\n",
      "\n",
      "=> Save your money and let's hope that the 'limited edition' Vortex will soon be out of stock. I love BPI products but truly regret having bought two Vortex powders as they'll just stand around forever now.\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed the feeling I got from 1.M.R. Vortex. I began using this a week ago and have experienced more energy during my workouts, especially during my pumps. The flavor is also really good, and I look forward to including it as part of my stack. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great pre-workout supplement without the jitters and boasts high energy during your workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is hands down the best pre-workout on the market! I have used many different pre-workouts, like c4, no xplode, clash, and mr. hyde, but vortex takes the cake! Trust me, 1 scoop is more than enough! I was skeptical, because 200 mg of caffeine is pretty light for me. However, the combination of the caffeine, yohimbe, and the rest of the ingredients is very potent. The energy and focus is intense. I remember my first workout using vortex. It was a full upper body day that lasted about 2 hours. No joke, I had just as much energy after the workout as I had at the beginning. I also set many pr's that day. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks, and there has not been a reason for me to go up to 2 scoops. This product is more for energy and focus rather than pump, so I have noticed great workouts when combining it with hemavol.\n",
      "The fruit punch flavor isn't really great, but it is not the worst either. Then again, taste doesn't matter that much for a pre-workout, because you are pounding it down.\n",
      "The mixability is poor when spoon stirred though, so I suggest using a shaker cup.\n",
      "The value is great with this product. I see no reason to bump up the dose to 2 scoops, even for the most stim-tolerant people. You get 50 true servings for 30 bucks, which is way better than other products on the market that require 2 to 3 scoops.\n",
      "This product is awesome. If you want to get the most out of your training sessions, Vortex is the way to go!\n",
      "Being a fan of the regular 1MR I was excited to try this new version of it, sadly I was greatly disappointed. It didn't give me the amount of energy that I thought it would and I would find myself running out of steam 30 minutes into my workout. I would take it on an empty stomach and would find myself getting a little nauseous at times. Another thing that disappointed where the pumps, or lack of them. I will not be purchasing this again, I'll just stick to the original. \n",
      "I'm currently going thru a divorce at 26 and find myself a single father of two kids trying to balance work, home, and gym. I purchaced Vortex after reading its reviews and label several times. I bought it to give me the extra umf when I've had a long day, and WOW does it work for me! I am only taking one scoop for now to acclimate myself to it and it working phenominally I have the energy and desire to push more weight! Haven't had any issues at at except my body isn't cnditined enough yet for all I want to do! But it will be soon! And I can't wait! My buddy Matt is ging to hop on board after he finishes his no xpolde which he says makes him drop a bomb shortly after consumming. I told him this stuff is great and hasn't made me have any foul effects. I love this stuff now just to get some new flavors! ;) thx 1.M.R Vortex 2014 will be a healthier stronger me and you will definately be a continued part of my success!\n",
      "First off I got this product for xmas and been taking this the past 4days and I have to say this is way better than 1mr, the pump/energy/focus in the gym with just 1scoop is absolutely amazing! Vortex pushes me through my workouts with very long last energy and pump! This vortex is just more power than any other supplement ive had! The fruit punch taste is ok not my fav but I don't care cause the energy/focus/pump from this product is just awesome and you wont even care about the fruit punch taste!\n",
      "I love this product. The focus is so intense. I feel it in about 10 minutes after taking it. I've tried a couple other pre workout supps, and this is my favorite cause of the focus it gives me. The only negative I have is the taste isn't the greatest. C4 tastes a lot better. But I would rather have a product that works well than great taste and so so results. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for pre workout. Just be careful with the dosage on an empty stomach. Too much will have you feeling high as a kite. Great product.\n",
      "1MR Vortex is probably one of the most balanced pre-workouts that I've tried. There is a definite energy spike that you'll feel, but it isn't overpowering like many other medium-stim or high-stim products. There is also a comfortable level of pump from Vortex that, again, isn't overpowering at all, but still makes you feel a noticeable difference when you're getting through your sets. \n",
      "\n",
      "The one con I can come up with is that it seems to wear off rather quickly. It seems to peak at about 30-60 minutes after ingestion (it recommends to wait 30 minutes before working out) and starts declining quickly after that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: \n",
      "I wouldn't say that this is the greatest PWO ever, as the official description hypes, but I would certainly recommend this product to someone as one of their first choices. 1MR Vortex won't give you \"intense pumps\" or \"intense energy,\" but it's balanced enough to have everything you would want in a PWO. \n",
      "8.5 / 10\n",
      "The taste is pretty close to the \"fruit punch\" of the original 1MR and it gives a good boost for my workouts but I seemed to make my heart race sometimes without waking my body up physically\n",
      "\n",
      "I got this when it went on sale recently for 25% off. I was excited to try it after BPi promoted the heck our of it. I have used 1MR and Pump-HD prior, and liked them both but Vortex feels entirely different. The flavor is good. I found it sweeter than most fruit punch flavored sups, but it was decent. I took one scoop to start, and noticed that it doesn't slap you in the face when it kicks in like 1MR does. It comes on slow, with no face tingles. I felt very focused and ready to train. This stuff really shined once I started training. I did arms/shoulders and felt like I could have completed my entire workout without resting. My energy and endurance was off the charts. I practically ran from one exercise to the next. I must say, be careful with the dosage. The next day I tried 2 scoops for leg day, and it was a disaster. Cold sweats, pounding heart, stomach cramps, it was bad news. I dialed it back to one scoop the next day and had another great workout. I learned the hard way that just because you don't feel a tremendous rush, doesn't mean that you need to increase the dosage. Start with one scoop and slowly increase if you feel the need. Overall a good PWO that would benefit someone who trains with a lot of volume I think. The added endurance really stands out to me with this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing product with awesome kick. I've tried 1MR Vortex on empty stomach ( no food for at least 6 hours... IT Job ;p ) I had effects such as : POWER and even more Power;p and I was red like hell;p. This product works and the flavor is good. \n",
      "The pump I get is off the charts!  I've tried several other preworkouts but this is just insane.  The best part of Vortex is the great focus and energy I have without any sort of crazy tingling feeling some others give off.  I really love the fruit punch flavor too!\n",
      "Almost done with my tub of 1.M.R and I have to say it did not meet my expectations. It's definitely a weaker product so I would not reccomend to anyone who has a high stimulant tollerance as I was taking 3-4 scoops and still not really feeling it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1mr vortex is wayyyyy better than then the regular 1mr. I took 2 scoops and looked in the mirror and thought what the hell did i take lol. I really like it i mix it with the creatine alkaline from BPI as well good combo!\n",
      "After taking 1MR for about 6 months my workouts started trailing and then this bad boy came along. I picked it up the first day it was available. My first workout with this took 2 hours just cause I felt invincible. I'm half way through the bottle and I've already seen huge gains due to my ability to workout for so long. It's great and I can't wait to get another bottle. Totally worth it and I would most defiantly recommend this to everyone that is crazy about pre-workouts.\n",
      "Baddest ish to hit the market. Taste is 2nd best Ive tried. The only thing is a lil mixability problem at the bottom. But a lot of pre drinks are like that. Chalky. As far as affects. Hold on to your seatbelt. I had energy, focus, drive, and pump out of this world. I stacked this product with Jay Cutlers Elite Series Pro Stim fat burner pill and wow. My face was flush but man!!! If you guys are serious about a pre stack. Try it out.\n",
      "So I've been looking at all the reviews on 1.M.R Vortex they went from REALLY GOOD to not really good! I'm going to give you my personal review on it. So I got it in the mail yesterday tested it out for the first time, I've got to say this stuff had me feeling great and pumped to workout. My buddy and I tried maxing out cause we were feeling great I went up 30 lbs in pulling and 15 lbs in my bench! Not saying it was the supplement but it was a great workout and great pump!\n",
      "I just got mine in the mail tonight, I mixed 1 scoop of it with 1 scoop CreaCore and mixed it for my preworkout. While I was doing reps I felt unstoppable, I just wanted to keep benching more and more reps. Kept me going throughout my entire workout. Definitely recommend this!\n",
      "Great Pump and power. I can't stop it really Crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Pump and focus, I recommend it to others. \n",
      "Got this stuff after seeing the special price drop and hearing all the hype around it, but that's all it was. Hype. Flavor is so-so... wish there was other options as I feel that fruit punch is widely over used and bland. Honestly I felt a much bigger pump and energy with the plain old 1MR rather than with this stuff. Really feels like they just slapped a new label on it and made the serving size less, which is about half of that of the original 1MR because its supposedly \"ultra concentrated.\" Now, I've used 2 scoops of original before and I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest, but within 3 or 4 days of using vortex, I was up to 2 scoops and didnt feel a difference. Big pass for anyone unless you get an amazing deal like 90% off or something.\n",
      "i don't know what is in this stuff but on the first day I took it, I started to breathe very heavily. Then just a couple sets into my first exercise, my chest started to hurt and I had trouble breathing. My 2nd day taking this stuff and i swear I felt like my chest was going to burst. \n",
      "\n",
      "I usually handle pre-workouts like a champ as I've been taking them for years now and I love BPI products, but the vortex is definitely something I won't be taking anymore. \n",
      "Nice steady energy. No crash. Excellent product.\n",
      "It's refreshing to find a pre-workout that WORKS! I LOVE this stuff!!!  Awesome pump and at a great price. What more could I ask for?\n",
      "I Have used a lot of different pre-workouts like c4 extreme, neurocore, nano vapor ..etc. \n",
      "but they are nothing compared to 1.M.R. Vortex, this pre-training powder gave me the best leg workout I have ever had, a lot of energy, great focus, and a nice pump. Thank you BPI for making an amazing Pre-workout worth spending my money on.\n",
      "Very impressed with Vortex! With all the hype, BPI definitely delivered.  The taste was was excellent and the focus was insane. Tried it for the first time on arm day and I didn't want to leave the gym!\n",
      "Very good pump\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is amazing. I took 1/2 a scoop and it made my workout amazing. I then took a whole serving and it was even more impressive. Combining it with pump hd really turned the tables on fatigue and my workouts have never been better. \n",
      "Took 1.M.R. Vortex for the first time today. WOW!!! Being a C4 user for a while now, I didn't think I would experience what i did today. I felt like i could have worked out for 4 hours. I hit my PR's in flat and decline bench. Had to force myself out of the gym. I will recommend regardless if you are currently using a pre-workout, you should try 1 serving at first. I tried 2 and i believe I wasn't ready for it. Awesome product!!!! \n",
      "I am searching for something to pump me up for many hours like CRAZE has done for so many months.  Now the product is no longer made.\n",
      "\n",
      "My search has lead me to 1.M.R Vortex.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must say, I took it once so far....  But it is very comparable to CRAZE.  Really Nice Pump for many hours.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I LIKE It!!!!\n",
      "So I got some of the 1 MR vortex the other day and I didn't know what to expect. I tried it and honestly I wasn't too impressed, at first. The second time I tried it it worked very well, I had a nice pump and good mental focus.  \n",
      "It mixes fairly well, the creatine monohydrate doesnt mix well and leaves a whitish foam on the top. When i mixed it in a shaker bottle it worked better but there was still a white film. Other another note the flavor is very good for a preworkout. It started working in about 30 minutes. However I work out for extended periods of time and after about 55 minutes the effects started to wear off. Overal I would give the product a rating of 8/10. I was pretty satisfied and will probably buy some again.\n",
      "I have decided to review this, because all the other reviews for this product arent done by verified buyers, so i am forced to believe every single person who has made a review is a robot created to assuage people into buying. First, ill start with mixability, which isn't all that great. Lots of white insoluble crap floats to the top. The taste is pretty good, nothing too terrible but it doesn't blow my mind. I am extremely stim tolerant so it's difficult to gauge how strong it will be for some, but id say it's up there. The one thing I really don't like about this product, is I often feel quite tired after 45-50 mins even though I have to do more excercises. I just seem to feel drained a lot faster. I hope someone has found this helpful. \n",
      "This is probably one of the worst preworkouts that I have ever purchased. With all of the high ratings, I had a very high expectation of what was to come when I purchased this product. First day, I took one scoop and felt absolutely nothing. I didn't even feel the caffeine rush. Day two of taking it, I felt nothing again. The only thing that was positive about 1 M.R. Vortex is that the taste is good. Overall, it was a complete let down and I would not recommend this product to anyone. They were right when they said this was not a sequel to 1 M.R., because the original is 10x better.\n",
      "great clean energy, more pump than expected since the ingredients are more focused on energy, and great taste. really solid product for a great price\n",
      "This is a great pre workout! It is much better than C4 extreme and the previous 1mr. I would have given it a 10 if it mixed better. When I drink it there is still powder at the top since it doesn't mix very well, but the energy and focus I get makes up for it. This is a phenomenal pre workout and I will be buying it again.\n",
      "I've tried other multies but this one seems to work best for my needs. There is a strong smell from the open container, which is to be expected, but no aftertaste at all. I've noticed my energy level increase and I feel more alert. I'm happy with this multivitamin and plan to continue using it as part of my monthly stack.\n",
      "3 tablets a day or the 3 tablets together in the morning?\n",
      "I'm happy with these vitamins... a lot better than any other I've tried.  Great energy boost! Overall great product. \n",
      "Works great in keeping my immune system where it should be after working 60+ hrs and hectic schedule.  It gives me the little extra I felt that I was missing.\n",
      "Affordable and easy to take\n",
      "These multi vitamins work much better than the others that I was taking. I feel a noticeable difference in energy in the morning after taking these. They seem to be also helping with my workouts. I have been taking the multi vitamins and BPI creatine and have noticed that I have lost some fat around my mid section and made size gains to my muscles without changing my workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there is a strange smell, but can actually increase movement energy, give me ten points\n",
      "\n",
      "Good multi with noticeable energy boost\n",
      "It's a good multi, gives some energy although nothing much to talk about. \n",
      "Has a strange aftertaste though. \n",
      "Saw a small difference. Not very good though. I took a similar supplement that was just $10 more and was amazing! Will not buy again. \n",
      "Honestly I didn't see any difference after using this stack\n",
      "I've used this combo a few times in the last year, and they never fail. Always make impressive gains in muscle, & my vascularity is off the charts!!! BPI rocks!! \n",
      "It works very good in my gain mass plan. Excellent product to increase natural production of testosterone. @Pudzianfit\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond expectations. Felt great. \n",
      "can you take hd elite and solid combo toghter? or do you finish hd elite which is one capsule a day and then start solid? \n",
      "\n",
      "thanks  all \n",
      "\n",
      "It an amazing product!! Wake up every morning like a beast, literally!! You need to go for the combination to achieve the best results! Just perfect!!\n",
      " I have tied this product and it has removed 80% of the estrogen build up in my midsections.  with in the first 10 days my love handles reduced by 60% and my spare tire shrunk. I did NOT do anything different in my diet or exerciser program at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been searching for a few months now for a good Amino Acid that gives me the recovery and energy that I need for my workouts. BPI did not disappoint with this at all. It gave me the energy I needed to power through my workouts and it tastes SAHHHH good. I would recommend this product, in fact I have! I gave my friend Hurricane Orange flavor and she loved it! Great job BPI!\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the flavors of both and they mix better than the amino mixes I've had ... but they don't completely mix and I just don't understand why. What part of the sediment is product and what part is filler? Still, better than the ones I've tried before these.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this product. I recently ran out and have been using a regular BCAA ( not the bpi product but another one).  But it's just not the same. I definitely notice the energy/focus that this gives me. This will forever be a staple in my workout regimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going to also try the Best BCAA for comparison.\n",
      "I've been using BPI Sports Best BCAAS for a while and just realized they had this Best Aminos with Energy product.  I had got a 5 serving sample of this on BB.com just to try it out and loved it so much I bought the full size container.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't use it intra workout because I workout in the evening and don't want to be up all night.  I drink this in the AM on an empty stomach and the caffeine gives me a small dose of \"pep in my step\". \n",
      "\n",
      "I used to be a heavy coffee drinker,  drinking 2-3 cups per day.  When I cut out coffee,  I missed the caffeine buzz and this really helps minus the calories but plus all the benefits!  Its got a great amino acid profile + the electrolytes and glutamine!  Its perfect for someone who's on Ketogenic Diet like myself.  Red Lemomade tastes like Kool-Aid!  I love it!  Definitely will continue using!! \n",
      "I recently started using best aminos with energy and I love it. It gives me the stamina I need without the jitters and itchiness. The hurricane orange tastes pretty good and not too sweet. I will continue using this product. \n",
      "I love all bpi products for the flavor and of course the results but Aminos with energy is amazing and one of my favorites! When I use aminos with energy I usually use it as a early morning supplement or before a good cardio session. It provides a good amount of sustained energy without the jitters. I can count on best aminos before a long run or an intense cardio session without getting really pumped like what you might experience with some pre workouts. (I know this isn't labeled as a pre wokout but that's usually what I use it for.) This is a great product and taste amazing!\n",
      "The first time I tried the Hurricane Orange flavor I loved it! I couldn't wait to order another bottle, but in the 2 month span between purchaces (Dec-Feb) something changed drastically with the flavor, I don't know if they added new ingredients or if it might have just been a bad batch. Either way, I'm definitely going to try a different flavor next time. But overall, this is really good source of BCAA and I definitely recommend it, just not the orange!\n",
      "I have been using this product for almost 10 months. I loved it since the first time I tried it. However, the last time I got it the flavor was terrible. Probably it was only this batch but if this happens again, I wont ever buy it.\n",
      "Regards!\n",
      "I was using Cellucor. What a vast improvement!! LOVE IT!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not bad does help me push though workout.\n",
      "I've used this product for a complete month. i use it not as a pre work out but in the middle of my workout though i have already had pre work out before. \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is amazing but the only issue i have with the taste is that it remains there for like ages. Whether you eat, drink or do whatever the after taste always comes back and remains there for good few hours. \n",
      "\n",
      "The quality of the product is amazing.  I have seen less fatigue now and it gives you the extra push when your almost down in the gym. ( won't be giving you huge extra push ) . I mainly use it for recovery, amino's and build muscles and its been doing all that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would recommend the 30 serving one as it is cheaper and worth it comparing to the 5 serving ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought a small, 7 serving package recently. The product tastes great and mixes well. The profile is very good, although I do wish the energy blend was not proprietary. My energy level was not raised whatsoever, which was a surprise since I am rather sensitive to caffeine. Although I despise the pre-workouts that make you feel all jittery and crazy, I do feel that one should make you feel a little more awake than before. I really felt zero bump in energy, which is a bit of a let down when you take this product for your AM workout. I will use it as a mid-day pick me up (of sorts), but unfortunately may not use this again.\n",
      "Love these BCAA's!  Keeps me energized throughout my workout and the Hurricane Orange flavor is amazing!!\n",
      "great pre-workout drink. no after taste and actually tastes great (hurricane orange). gets me focused and ready for the gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "These aminos with energy was a perfect supplement to give me that pre-workout push.  It will not provide any pump, but will get your heart rate up.  Great with an non-stimulate pre-workout.  I use it as a replacement to energy drinks throughout the night since I work the graveyard shift.  \n",
      "I got the smaller 5 serving size in both red lemonade and orange. Both tasted great and did everything they promised. But on the packaging it said 1 scoop was one serving and there where supposed to be 5 servings. But I got about 15 scoops out of each and they tasted like they should with the recommended amount of water. I would like to know if the nutritional values on the back reflected the serving size of 1 scoop or 1/5 of the whole container. Either way it did what I bought it for and I got much more than expected. Will definitely buy again\n",
      "Pretty good product. Mixes very well with virtually no sign of \"particles\" and taste is great. I mix it with a preworkout now because I need more stems. I have my wife using too. She likes it a lot\n",
      "Great taste (Hurricane Orange) and blended well.  Definitely repurchasing!\n",
      "I absolutely love BPI products!  You can see my review on their protein powders in the Body Blog section of my account.\n",
      "\n",
      "BPI Sports won my heart when I found out about their testing methods for their protein.  I'm unsure whether the rest of their products are tested, but in my opinion, if a company goes to all the trouble to get Chromadex testing done on their protein powders, they most likely care about what goes into the rest of their products as well.\n",

      "BPI Sports Best Aminos with Energy (Blue Icy Raz) is absolutely delicious!  It mixes very easily and the flavor is not overpowering with 10-16oz of water.  To say these BCAAs give me energy is an understatement.  They don't cause my body to tingle like a pre-workout would, but the energy boost they give me is on-going for hours.  That point made, I will state it is not a good idea to take these anywhere near bed time.  I made that mistake once and took it around 6pm for a 7-8:30pm workout and I was up for the rest of the evening, tossing and turning.  If you generally do evening workouts, BPI Sports best BCAAs will provide you with an adequate amount of energy as well, but the effects won't last into the night after your workout is completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only issue I have with this product, (and it's an issue I have with several BCAAs products) is that the nutritional information is somewhat off.  Most BCAAs list protein as 0g.  BCAAs actually contain up to 1g of protein per gram in the serving size.  So, 10g of the product would actually equal up to 10g of protein per serving, equaling up to 40 calories.  The product does claim 10 calories for the 2g of carbohydrates and I greatly appreciate that fact.  I just wish more BCAAs products would include the calories and grams of protein contained in the BCAAs, since most people who are counting would want to know.\n",

      "New fan of BPI products. Have seen great results from taking this, their ISO protein, creatine, and regular BCAA's. Also the taste has been great for every single one. I've had Passion Fruit, Green Apple, Snow Cone, Watermelon, and Red Lemonade all of which are amazing!\n",
      "Hurricane orange tastes amazing. I feel zero fatigue during workouts.\n",
      "Best Tasting Creatine Blend I Try. I Mix It With My Best BCAA( One Scoop Of Each ) For A Better Post-Workout Recovery Drink. The Result Are Amazing My Strength And Recovery Are Up And I Be Able To Build Muscle More Easier And I Be Able To Put Some Extra Pound On The Weight Scale.I Gain 5 Pounds With The Half Of The Tub With A Better Nutrition Plan And A Better Workout ( Shortcut To Size ). Considering Im A Hard Gainer This Is A Amazing Product I Recommand It And I Will Buy Again Thank You BPI \n",
      "Awesome product that does it's job and lime sherbet is unbelievably good.....BUY!\n",
      "Best creatine I have tried \n",
      "\n",
      "The Watermelon flavor of this Creatine is actually pretty good, however my biggest complaint is that it is far too sweet tasting. You can add extra water to dilute the sweetness, but then the flavor is also diluted. The product does not mix very well, however that is not uncommon for Creatine products. Overall I like this product and believe it has helped with my overall strength and muscle growth and will likely buy again.\n",
      "I started taking this product in conjunction with a Kris Gethin workout plan and have noticed that I am getting better results with it than I was getting before.  The flavor is a little sugary tasting but is great otherwise.  I stack this with the BPI BCAA supplement and together I am recovering faster while getting amazing workouts and results in.\n",
      "I am now almost through my first tub therefore I can give an honest review. When I first statred taking it I noticed a difference after my first week, I can do more reps with my usual weight and I went heavier fast. On training days I take one scoop after my work out and on my off days I take one fist thing in the morning on an empty stomach. The snow cone tastes amazing with cold water.\n",
      "Amazing Product\n",
      "When I first got my order I opened this up and noticed that the powder, or what was powder was all clumped up in big balls like moisture got into it at some point. I also got a few other things by this brand that also had similar issues........ This is my first time to this site and probably my last.\n",
      "Bought the fruit punch and it taste great. I take it during by work out keeps energy levels up and helps with muscle recovery. And best of all muscles are growing and looking great!\n",
      "Fairly good taste.  Adds girth and helps me get through my work out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great creatine mix. Giving you six forms of creatine in one supplement is pretty awesome. Results are there with a nice pump. Watermelon was not a bad flavor but I loved the Snow Cone Glutamine so I purchased Snow Cone for my creatine blend. BPI is great! \n",
      "One of the best tasting products for creatine and worked excellent, cutting my bmi from 34.5 to 27.9 in just 4 weeks!\n",

      "One of the best tasting creatine that I've had and I wasn't bloated after I used it. This is my second tub and I recommend it to my friends.\n",
      "If you ain't using this creatine you are a fool. Bpi makes some **** good products and this is one of them. I take it everyday paired up with bpi bcaa (I try to match flavors that I think would go good together) and drink it during my workout and in the morning on off days in my little \"offday a.m. drink\". Every flavor of this stuff I've had has been great and results have been as well. \n",
      "I like this product. It mixes easily and works.\n",
      "Great product! Muscle FULLNESS and strengthen increase!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed improvements all around and then when I got off this product!! My strength dropped and ascertains sets and exercises became more difficult and just a struggle! Also definitely one of better tasting creatines and mixes well. Another thing I like about this one is it's a nice combo of creatine and not just one form!\n",
      "Just recently order these! very strong, taste good, and works quickly! Would recommend!\n",

      "\n",
      "BPI never lets me down with their products. Mix-ability and taste are on a completely different level than any other creatine I've had. Any fatigue or soreness the day after a hard workout is almost unheard of when you throw this in with BPI's whey and BCAA's. 10/10. Period.\n",
      "BPI best Creatine is very good, it makes training more powerful and stronger\n",
      "I train two times a day, this is boxing and gym and it is working fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is my favorite creatine on the market by far. Tried a few other brands (ON, Beast Sports, and Cellucor) but BPI Sports exceeds all of those brands in every aspect of this product. Very effective, within a week I saw noticeable strength gains. This product didnt bulk me up either or and didn't make me retain water. Excellent product. Snowcone is delicious, I could drink it all day. Really dont know how this didn't win creatine of the year but BPI Sports is definitely making a huge impact in the supplement market. New favorite brand. If you want the most effective creatine, buy this for sure!\n",
      "I only gave it a 5 for taste. Unfortunately, my body did NOT like this product. Did anyone else have an issue with severe stomach cramping after taking this product? Now I have 2 full containers of it. I've used other creatines before and was fine. \n",
      "BPI Great product. I got into this product about 9 months ago. I had been off from lifting for a couple years and I needed all the help i could get to get my strength back. I surpassed all my maxes prior by big amount. This product helped in this success; great recovery, strength, and size. Stuff is a staple to my workouts. Blue raz and snow cone Flavors are great and refreshing, a little settling at the end of a good chug but nothing to whine about. SOLID!\n",
      "this is the best creatine i have ever used ive gotten great results from this and it taste GREAT  as well update i have been using this for several months now while the results in the beginning where good they stopped after the first month. while it taste great there are cheaper and better creatine out there so look around \n",
      "I absolutely love the flavor of this! It mixes awesome!! I have any issues with it being grainy. I hit the gym 4-5 days a week and mix cardio in there some days as well and my body is never sore the next day. I'd def recommend this product and I'll for sure be trying other flavors. \n",
      "Great product! I tried it for the first time from a sample and noticed a great pump. The product did exactly what all pre workouts do for me without the jittery feeling and after crash. I recommended it to all my buddies and they feel the same about the product. 2 thumbs up!!\n",
      "Just another scam supplement that doesn't even do anything. Tastes like crap too. Way to sweet.\n",
      "Really great product! I never used creatine before this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have noticed an increase in my gains-rate when I introduced creatine into my diet. The taste is really good, though if it isn't suitably diluted then the taste can become overpowering. Great value specially the BOGO free promo that is available every so often.\n",
      "Best creatine ever!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Do like drinking chalk? If not then don't buy this stuff. It coats your tongue and your throat. I tried more water, waited longer to dissolve more, maybe helped a little but not enough. The flavor is good I guess but that won't help. Worst part is I got a BOGO, hope I can get a little money back. I previously used HITS creatine loved it and got good results with it. Oh well guess I know why it's on sale. \n",
      "Good flavor and seeing results.\n",
      "Thus far I'm really enjoying this Creatine!  It mixes perfectly with the BPI BCAA (Arctic Ice).  I've been looking for a good amino/creatine mix, but thus far all the flavors I've tried have been really strong and overpowering (because of the amino). I really enjoy the mild flavor of the snowcone, and it mixes very well in water.  I take this pre/intra/post workout, and have definitely noticed a difference in my strength gains and energy; I don't even take a pre-workout anymore.  Overall, I would certainly recommend this product/flavor to others, and will definitely be purchasing this again in the future.\n",
      "Super awesome product. Probably my favorite product right now. The taste is fantastic! I hit up the B2G1 so I have been taking it twice on my work days, and once on my active rest days. I don't really have anything negative to say, so this is a super positive review. I recover a little better and faster. I feel much stronger and healthier in my lifts. And... I haven't really been retaining a whole lot of water weight, which I am not too worried about, but I really look forward to taking this creatine EVERY SINGLE DAY! Btw, it is hard to rate any product a 10 in case your wondering.\n",
      "\n",
      "WOW! Took this before working out and drinking during the workout, I feel so much stronger and could get through my entire workout.  Highly recommended!\n",

      "Another quality BPI product. Have had 0 GI issues and the snowcone flavoring is outstanding. \n",
      "The snow cone flavor is awesome. I typically use unflavored Creatine and mix it in to my post workout protein shake, but I sampled the snow cone flavor and had to buy it. Easy to\n",
      "Mix, sweet, but not too sweet. Try it out!\n",
      "mixes okay but i don't like seeing as many particles as i do not mixed. Good label and a certified company so thats awesome. i have bought it multiple times and its good, sometimes the flavor is a little much and i do one scoop to a whole bottle of water so it is a light flavor. Solid creatine supp.\n",
      "I read the reviews before ordering, which led me to order. By the time I was at the bottom of the container I was able to see results. I was also able to feel the difference while performing reps.  The flavor was great, however it did have a slightly chalky aftertaste. \n",
      "Wow, this has to be the best flavor I've ever had in a supplement!  It really tastes like a snow cone!  Makes me want to throw some ice in the blender with it and indulge.  Most times, I have to chug my pre-workout & other powders but this is truly an enjoyable flavor.   \n",
      "New to this creatine stuff but thanks to recomendation I gave this a try and It has helped. 2 weeks after I started this product I noticed change in power and even in muscle mass. Taste is good but have trouble with mixing (It tends to be a bit grainy and it foams) but other than that I will keep buying this product. Thanks BPI Sports!\n",
      "Flavor is excellent.  I like this product more than Creacore, but about the same as BUILD-HD.  Lately, I've been mixing in some A-HD.  Creatine always has a tendency to make me feel stronger and make the workouts go better.\n",
      "I bought this product because I had an earlier free samplol of the Snowcone flavour. WOW, what a taste! The first time I tasted this, it knocked me on my ***. It was wonderful, but after a week or so, the amazeballs of the flavour wore off and was no longer impressive. Also, I noticed that if you let it settle at all - even for a minute - you may have to shake it up again. I can see stuff on the bottom of the bottle.\n",
      "As a creatine, the product works fairly well, but definitely give it a go just for the array of interesting and unique flavours.  I would totally buy this again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result is great, I feel during workout more strength. I usually take this pre and post with Bpi Best Protein and I can feel clearly more strength overall i don't take this if I am using a stimmed preworkout that has creatine in it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Side-effect: the first time I used this I had severe headache but no longer had it after the third use. It could be caused by something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snowcone taste amazing and after taste during workout is cool. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend this if you want creatine supp. \n",
      "works great!\n",
      "got this a couple days ago, had it a few times since. ordered 50 serv. of snowcone. dont really know how to describe the taste, but its amazing. same with the blue razz. it mixes really well, doesnt leave any gritty powder at the bottom like some of the other creatines ive tried have tended to do\n",
      "I have tried creatine before trying this product and have always had the belief that creatine really doesn't help very much.  After trying this product i can truthfully say i take back what i said before!  In just 3 weeks of religiously using this product i have seen a tremendous increase in size, strength and most importunely recovery time.  One of the best product i have ever used.\n",
      "When I first tried this product I found the fruit punch too sweet, I eventually got used to it. I haven't used this long enough to see much change however I do believe it helped with strengthening my muscles. It's all about finding the products that work best with your physiology.\n",
      "Excellent flavor and results. \n",
      "I am not going to rate the benefits of creatine itself, as that is a very well studied subject.  I have used creatine in the past and had great results.  I prefer flavored designer creatines and decided to give BPI Snow Cone a shot after the rave review.\n",
      "The flavor is dead on for a snow cone flavor.  It reminds me of the blue part of a snow cone, since  snow cone itself isn't a flavor.  It mixes almost perfect for creatine.  You get some nice added goodies with it and BPI is always running specials so the value is great.  Definitely one of the best flavored creatines I have had.   \n",
      "Snowcone is amazing! not overly sweet. really great taste.\n",
      "The creatine itself is doing a great job, while i am taking other supplements at the same time. the results are coming in faster than I had planned. Great product, would recommend.\n",
      "I love this creatine. Snow Cone flavor is awesome!! It's like the premade snow cones you get from an ice cream truck with the pointy cone. So good. I have been sipping on this all day, and I love that the creatine doesn't fall out of solution and settle into grit on the bottom of the cup. \n",
      "Delicious!\n",
      "Bought this on a BOGO after hearing about its amazing flavors. The flavors are just that, amazing! Snow Cone is out of this world and Blue Razz is the sleeper. They have multiple types of creatine which I could care less about. The serving is 4 grams which is all you need daily. This is easily a steal when on sale and should be a staple for those wanting a flavored creatine. \n",
      "This product is great, awesome flavor and I have seen great results! I put it in a gallon jug and put 2 scoops of this stuff in, and drink it all day.\n",
      "I can definitely feel the results of this product and will be purchasing more soon! I have been taking mine mostly after workouts along with the bcaa from bpi for maximum recovery benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "the best tasting supplement in the industry they should make more like this I had the snowcone I loved it \n",
      "I have been using BPI Sports Creatine with my workout now roughly 4 months now and WOW. With hard work, a better diet and BPI Sports Creatine I was able to go from over 200 pounds down to 170, not to mention the muscle/definition I am starting to add on due to the help of this product. I am getting stronger every day and I will continue to use this product and support it. Feel free to look at my before and after photos on my bodybuilding.com page and see the proof for yourself. BPI Sports product are no joke!\n",
      "\n",
      "First time I tried BPIi Best Creatine. I will have to admit I'm very impress was able to recover the next day plus stack with BPI Bcaa's nice combo. I love the fact you don't have to do a loading phase and can take it right after our workout either by itself or mix with your fav protein. Will I buy again oh yes.\n",
      "This is the 3rd or 4th creatine power I have tried and it is my favorite so far. The Snow Cone flavor is the best tasting supplement I've ever used! This product seems to be as effective as any other creatine I've used and doesn't cause me any water bloating or puffiness. \n",
      "LOVE LOVE it, working great on my body, very light to the stomach and easy to mix with any drink.\n",
      "It's creatine, of course it's going to work. The better absorption from the other forms I'm sure will help make it better. Now, the taste. THIS IS THE BEST TASTING POWDER I HAVE EVER HAD. So, if you like creatine, and you like it cheap, and you like just something delicious to sip on, here you go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snowcone tastes amazing. Simple review, if your looking for taste Snowcone is 10/10.\n",
      "I feel this product is great. I have the snow cone flavor and it taste great. Will continue to take this for a couple of more weeks and will be trying the BPI Sport Protein soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using this product for about 20 days and I can tell you it's really good...💪\n",
      "the snowcone doesn't taste bad, and it has given me results! i am able to do more reps per set and my recovery time has decreased significantly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The creatine is OK,does it's job,i dislike the snow cone flavor though,too sweet for me,some other people might like it , in my opinion the Unflavored Creatine from BB is the best \n",
      "By far my favorite creatine I have used. The taste is great. I like the mixture of different creatines, no loading also saves a lot of money, the best way on the fancy creatines that are a little more pricey is to wait for sales on them but other than that it is a creatine I will stick with for a long time \n",
      "I take other supplements, just started using creatine, and for the first time- for a first time creatine buyer- I went with BPI Best Creatine, and it was worth it! The taste was amazing! Taste like store bought juice, and the mixability is perfect- blends well with shaker bottle and blender! Not only does it taste and mixes well, but it also works. I have only been taking it for three weeks now, but i have noticed increase reps and endurance. A great buy and a must try for everyone! Try it once!! What's the worst that can happen?!?!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WOW! Bought this creatine because I saw a unique flavor that was actually different from the over done fruit punch, blue raspberry, etc.. SNOWCONE! So freakin' delicious. Other companies are sure to copy this, it's soooo good. Can't rate this on the effects yet cause I just started to take it but just had to let everyone know how good this flavor is!!!\n",
      "As a precursor to my review, I will state that I am on a KETO diet and training routine. I decided to give this a try as a preworkout and I'll give it to you with no frills. I am already into my week 4 of KETO so my energy levels and training are baselined to give this and other products a fair review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor rating  9 - I really like the Tropical Freeze taste and its not too sweet. Mixes well with water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effectiveness rating 7 - I'm coming from a PreKaged, Bullnox, C4, and Redline background and if you're used to that type of neuro focus and intensity, I would say that this is a bit different and can take some time to get acclimated. This was a bit disappointing initially but I also did not feel the \"itchies\", I was never jittery, and the post workout crash is also minimal compared to some of the others so that was a positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Onset and Duration rating 10 - The onset was pretty close to what I read at about 30 minutes which is my typical drive to the gym so that works for me. Duration is about 90-120 minutes before feeling a significant decline. My workout last a bit on the 2+ hour side so I had to make some adjustments but still a positive for duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall rating 9 - As a tool for the cardio based or crossfit training routine I would give it a self standing 10. As a preworkout for the strength based or bodybuilding focused routine I would STILL recommend this as a great product but you need to make it part of a stacked preworkout mix in my opinion (I am experimenting with a 1/4 scoop of PreKaged, BA stack)\n",
      "Taste was good, pump is more of a pump designed for cardio. definitely better if you're following the Keto diet if not don't even bother\n",
      "Performance = Incredible for what its designed for-Cardio. However, If your stomach has been getting upset with all the creatine loaded Pre-workouts that you take for that killer pump, THIS is a great supplement to cycle with to give your gut a break (it may not give you the huge pump your looking for in a Pre, but its not bad). Use this for a great cardio session. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste = Pretty good \n",
      "\n",
      "Very good new product. Enough kick to be a pre workout with the crash. Is more of a keto product for those who follow that diet. \n",
      "I was excited for the release of this product back in May being a fan of BPI. At this time, I was also steering away from pre workouts with nitrate blends. I really enjoy that this pre workout doesn't make me nauseous during my high intensity workouts. Definitely gets me going on my early morning workouts. Kinda wish the container wasn't so narrow. It's hard to scoop when you're getting to the end of it but that's got nothing to do with the actual product itself, which is why I'm still giving it a solid 10. \n",
      "This was a disappointment at best. Felt nothing. No stimulation. No pumps over baseline. Thick and a large volume of powder per scoop. This will teach me not to try something just because I like the brand or because it's on sale. Now I have 3 tubs of a product I don't want to use.\n",
      "I LOVE this! LOVE! It's hard finding supplements being Keto but this is the BEST THING OUT THERE!!! Absolutley amazing taste, mega flavor, and is a wicked PreWorkout. Mixes great with my other supplements and completely masks some of the bad tastings ones. I will buy so much more of these!!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're keto, this is WHAT YOU WANT!\n",
      "Delicious. I use this for cardio/leg day.\n",
      "Only problem is the bottle is narrow and it's hard to scoop out the last of the supp.\n",
      "Excellent product, like both flavors I have tried, \n",
      "\n",
      "The Blue Lemon Ice mixes well with the Best Blue Raz Creatine, \n",
      "I found Best Pre Workout powers me through my early AM workouts.  (starting when gym opens, and finishing when it is time to go to work.)\n",
      "I do not have to eat prior to taking or working out. I like how it lifts my energy without jitters or over stimulation and has No noticeable crash either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basic workout plan, warm up. lift, stretch and cardio. \n",
      "great tasting mixes well not much of a pre workout though\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never really liked pre-workouts but this one is awesome!  I am on a Keto diet and the plunges me into my workout and deeper into ketosis.  I order 2 more bottles before i even finished my first.  lost about 6lbs since starting it.\n",
      "I use to take this brand a few years ago but now, it seems as if it does nothing for me. The flavor is great but I've tried taking it 20 to 30 minutes before my workout and even right before. It just didn't give me the drive I needed. Especially working 12 hours shifts, I need something that will push my energy levels up so I can make it through a workout and this is no longer it.\n",
      "Decent pre work out, flavor is good effect is ok.\n",
      "Although I am fairly certain this pre-workout never put me into ketosis, I did get some good energy and the taste is delicious.\n",
      "I kind of wish they added something like Nitrosigine or Agmatine, it appears they want people to stack it with Pump HD. I did lean up actually, went down from 209 to 203 in 2 weeks. Ketogenic diets and supplements work.\n",
      "If you already used pre-workout like C4 or Jack 3D, this one is not for you! Althought the focus is good you don't get any pump or get the intensity you have from the 2 mentioned before. I won't buy this product again .\n",
      "Ok. First of all I never write reviews on bb.com.. However, reading through other reviews, I feel that I definitely have to write about this product. This is designed for those who are on Keto Diet, or on very very low carbs. If you are looking for crazy energy and pumps - don't buy this. If you are on normal clean protein/carbs/fats ratio - don't buy this. \n",
      "However, if are on Keto diet - this is the ONLY way to go. This is made for you. The most important part of this pre is that it actually starts/increases ketosis in your body - utilization of body fat as energy. This part definitely works - I have purchased ketostix to test if I was able to put my body into keto state after two weeks of correct diet - and it turned out that amount of ketones was medium (according to color). After taking this pre for day or two - I tested again and amount of ketones was large. \n",
      "It also provides okay amount of energy, which lasts for about 1.5-2 hours.  So, recommended if you're on keto or on low low carbs and trying to go into keto.  \n",
      "Tropical freeze tastes delicious.\n",
      "The watermelon ice taste like crystal light, so not a bad flavor but a little too bland diet drink tasting for me personally. I also purchased the lemon ice flavor so I'm hoping to like that one better. The first time I took it I felt great, decent pump without the jitters, but since then I have almost no feeling after drinking it. I've tried cycling off of it completely, and using other preworkouts between uses and I still have no extra feeling after taking it. I personally get the best results from prejym.\n",
      "Since I can't do thermos and \"A\" makes me itch - I tried this.  None of the nasty after effects . The blue ice is a mellow, smooth flavor. No medicine aftertaste.  I will continue to use it, and I will buy more in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do intermittent fasting and decided to give this a go. gave me great energy for my morning cardio sessions - definitely a fan.  Tropical freeze tastes like pineapple juice. Yum!!\n",
      "I was a little hesitant to try this pre workout due to the fact it has a small amount of calories in it. However; I really wanted to try the new Keto. pre workout so, I ordered the Blue Lemon Ice flavor.  The flavor wasn't terrible but it was thicker than what I expected, almost syrupy- melted popsicle kind of texture. It did provide energy.  In fact, so much so that I accidentally added an extra set to each of my exercises. lol  The energy has lasted throughout the day so I am impressed with that.  Not my favorite, but I will definitely keep it stocked.\n",
      "First day upon using the product and I am pleased. Took it before my cardio session in the afternoon. Flavor was pretty good (I like that new flavors are rolling out with BPI and not just the same flavors on different products). I noticed great energy boost after about 20 minutes. The energy was sustained throughout my whole session which was great. Only downside was that this product made me extremely thirsty. I drink an abundance of water daily but my goodness, this product gave me cotton mouth badly a number of times. Besides having to hydrate twice as much as normal, this product was great at giving energy which is much needed with low carb diets. Will update later with fat burning results of the product.\n",
      "BPI sent me sample of the White Chocolate Pretzel and Apple Crumb Cake. Both tasted great. I ended up buying S'mores because I really like their S'mores flavored protein powders. When other reviewers talk about how tough these bars are to eat, they aren't kidding. I don't know if other flavors are softer, but I literally could not eat these bars. However, my mother is gluten free and I notice a lot of stuff that is gluten free is also dense and really tough to eat so its probably a gluten free thing. Luckily, I had S'mores flavor so I just put them in the microwave for 12 seconds and they were warm and soft which was awesome!  9/10 because I just couldn't get over how hard these were to eat without microwaving them. Otherwise, they taste great, ingredients are great, and it gets the job done. \n",
      "I purchased this and the Elite vanilla cupcake protein bar at the same time and Elite was a definite winner. It was softer and had a better taste. \n",
      "I REALLY like these bars.  I've only had the White Chocolate Pretzel, but I really like the flavor, and I actually like the texture.  They are both crunchy and chewy, and it takes a little longer to eat them, which works for me, because it lets me satisfy my craving for that, with something that's pretty healthy.  I also like that they use stevia, which is a totally natural, safe sweeter, that doesn't add calories.\n",
      "I really like BPI protein so got these bars for business travel (usually travel with Quest bars). The texture and overall taste were disappointing, I tried 3 flavors (bought a box of each)...white chocolate pretzel was the best of the three.  I would use these if no other healthy options, but will go back to quest bars for future travel\n",
      "Too much sugar, taste correct, there's nothing like Grenade bars! \n",
      "The taste was very disappointing with these.  I gave these bars a 5 because I really like the ingredient profile.  It's just hard to want to eat them because of the flavor and texture.  They are texture of a \"power bar\" and taste like protein powder.  The white chocolate pretzel is a little more palatable because of the chunks of pretzel to help with the flavor and texture.  I love BPI Best Protein powder!!....best I've ever used and tasted.......but I'll have to shop around for a better protein bar!\n",
      "\n",
      "Very clean bar when it comes to ingredient list. Taste is good but I still prefer quest bars when the price is equal. Some other bars might be tastier but their ingredient list requires degree in chemistry to understand. \n",
      "Coming from Quest bars and oh yeah! One bars it took some time to get used to the texture of these bars. I've tried almost all the flavors but the only one worth purchasing is the white chocolate pretzel mainly because It's the only brand that makes this unique flavor combination. It isn't the sweetest and it is a bit chewy and texturely challenged but the pretzel bits make up for that. Over all an good bar.\n",
      "Recently purchased these bars as an alternative to Quest bars which I really liked in all their variations but felt like trying something new, taste was ok texture was a bit hard to bite off the bar and once you start chewing it I agree with a few other reviews where they mentioned it has a taffy chewy feel to it, overall these bars where good but in my opinion there's better bars out there just a matter of taste buds and preference.\n",
      "Make sure your teeth are in good shape before buying this, they are HARD to chew and stick to your teeth afterward.  Taste is okay but they are so hard to eat.  I also cycle and could never eat one of these bars on the bike.  Very hard to eat, would not recommend this product.\n",
      "So I thought I would try another flavor. Didn't have much flavor, kinda sticky gooey, however no stomach issues. That's about all I have to say about this one.\n",
      "I've tried every brand of protein bars out there , im a BIG BIG fan of BPIsports they always have the best flavours but this bar was disgusting I took one bit and had to throw the rest out this bar was basically trying to eat chewing gum the taste the texture just gross im sorry\n",
      "Quite frankly, I love these bars. I've ordered several cases now and eat through them like mad. They are good quality ingredients. They are tough to chew, but I find keeping them in my pocket for a while softens them up nicely and gives them a better texture. Will continue buying cases. However - read individual labels. They are NOT all gluten free, which is why I didn't rate it. I have them, but can't eat them. Bodybuilding.com was good about refunding me though.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bars are horrible. Super tough to chew. I've had many bars and these are by far the worst. They taste like crap and the texture is weird. Don't buy, find something else to eat.\n",
      "These are seriously the worst bars ever... I have tried a couple of protein bars, including Quest, Combat Crunch Peanut Butter Cup (delicious!), etc. but this... ?\n",
      "\n",
      "The texture is horrible. It's SO HARD to chew the bar that your teeth could come out. It sticks to your teeth and feels like hard cardboard. The taste is not remotely like peanut butter. I'm serious, I wouldn't buy these again even with an 80% discount...\n",
      "I use protein bars very regularly to get me through the day.  These seemed to be a good buy, but I was a bit disappointed with the taste and the amount of sugar (considering how bad they tasted).  I tried three flavors- the best was white chocolate pretzel, but the sugars were higher than I would like (likely due to the real pretzels in it).  Cookies and cream is pretty bad and iced vanilla cupcake was less than enjoyable to eat.\n",
      "Fit Crunch tastes far, far better than these.  I thought MP's Combat bars were better than these as well.  I probably won't buy these again.\n",
      "The taste is great, but these bars are a bit stickier and more chewy that other protein bars - almost like a giant Starburst candy or Laffy Taffy. Also, there's a bit more fat and sugar than I'd like in a protein bar. But for weight gain the macros work okay for me and I just take small bites and drink lots of water to help get it down. I don't think I'd buy these if they were not on sale, though.\n",
      "I must say, I was excited to try these bars; particularly surrounding their hype and mass promotion. I bought two 12 packs, chocolate peanut butter and cookies and cream. The chocolate peanut butter is a chocolate bar with maybe 2-3 peanut butter morsels inside of it, and the cookies and cream tastes very artificial, almost chemical. They are also somewhat oily/greasy, and the texture is less than desirable. I was disappointed by these bars because BPI makes amazing products. Because of this, I had to make the switch to the MP Combat Crunch, and there is absolutely no comparison between them. Perhaps if they made a second round batch of these, they could change some things for the better.\n",
      "BPI is my go to brand...I used their BCAAs, their Glutamine, and their protein powder. Their protein powder is the best I have ever tried in terms of mixability and flavor. And they never skimp on the quality of ingredients. I decided to order one of each flavor of these bars to see which one I wanted to buy 12 of...as it turns out I don't want 12 of these things ever..honestly they're so bad. I felt like I was eating a bar of clay or something..the texture is so off and the flavor is not good. I really wanted to like these too.\n",
      "The bars taste great, but at room temperature they are extremely chewy - chewier than a Tootsie Roll. I had bought them for my wife, and it pulled one of her fillings out!. I found if you microwave them for 20 seconds, it makes them easier to chew.\n",
      "We're pretty good. Can't complain for a protein bar.. will buy agsin\n",
      "BPI really missed the boat on this bar from a taste and appearance standpoint.  If you were expecting to unwrap the packaging to find a bar that had similar colors to Oreos, you were in for a surprise.  Upon taking a first bite of the bar, I actually thought to myself, \"Maybe they packaged the wrong flavor.\" Nope.  After reading other reviews, this is their spin on cookies and cream, and it's a total miss.  The nutritional makeup is there, but if you were hoping it would taste good, too, you are in for a disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty decent overall. After trying the flavorful BPI Sports protein powder, I decided to try out the bars. The bars are big and keep your hunger down, and also provide 20 grams of protein per bar. In addition, you get a lot of fiber which can help your body process food easier. I usually eat these after my morning runs and get a good energy boost and filling from them. The only thing I don't like about them was that they were kind of hard when they arrived in the mail.\n",
      "The flavor was good but the consistency was hard and dry and not as good as other bars.\n",
      "These bars were such a disappointment. I ordered the Cookies and Cream and S'mores flavor to give them a try and they were NOT \"rich and soft, with that fresh baked feel\" that the description claims they would have. They were both weirdly stale, and had a crispy crunch to them. As far as actual flavor goes, they tasted more like cardboard than a good protein bar, although not as bad as others I've tried, which is why they get a rating of 3 and not 0. I don't know if maybe they were sitting around in a warehouse for too long or if they just taste that way. I really like BPI products and was expecting so much more from these bars! Disappointed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am just all around disappointed with this bar. They are hard to chew and too sweet. I thought they would work because of the IMO (prebiotic fiber) but I am pretty sure the sugar alcohols are upsetting my stomach. I expected better from bpi SPORTS. \n",
      "It is hard to say what flavor I liked more because I think they are both near perfect! I think it would just depend on what mood I was in, like if I wanted something a bit more chocolaty or not. The pieces of peanut butter and cookies in these bars really help bring the flavor to life and make this product shine among all the competitors!\n",
      "I have to say that the Cookies and Cream flavor of this bar really took me by surprise because even though it is my favorite flavor, many companies do not get it right. A lot of the time you get a nasty after taste with C&C for some reason but the only surprise that you get with these is a nice texture change with the cookie pieces. try it, you wont be disappointed  \n",
      "Texture is definitely soft, and the addition of the crunchy graham cracker/marshmallow bits (similar to the Quest S'mores bar, but bigger) was welcome. I found the flavor to be a little too sweet, but I can see why others would like it more than me. Probably won't take the place of Quest/Oh Yeah in my snackbox, but definitely a quality product.\n",
      "The taste is close enough to the real one. But for some odd reason the marshmallow is always hard as rock. It also tastes better than the peanut butter one. \n",
      "I absolutely hated it.  I gave a whole box away.  Other people raved about it, so maybe its just me.  I recommend buying one bar first and if you like it, get a box.  Don't be like me, who got a whole box of something she hated.\n",
      "Normally I hate cookies and cream because I find it too sweet but this bar does not give me that problem. What I really appreciate most about this product is that it is gluten free and great on my sensitive stomach. for these reasons i give it at 10/10.\n",
      "This bar is fantastic! I have seen some mixed reviews and was a bit skeptical about them because of the mix  of opinions, so I decided that i would try them my self. I thought that this bar is well made and tastes great! I dont see how anyone can say that the are terrible, makes me think that it is just an attack on the brand its self. I understand that someone may not have liked the flavor as much as others, but to say that they are \"horrible\" tells me that there are definitely bias out there.\n",
      "I am a big fan of protein bars, I love having them available for those times when you do not have to your protein shakes or even as a healthy snack. So of course I had to try the new BPI bar to see how it measures up and I have to say that i love it! The best part about this one is that there is no nasty after taste like the one you get with other chocolate protein products. \n",
      "Honest the (sugar alcohol) needs to be replaced with 'salt', chocolate and salt blends great together.  #backtothelab\n",
      "This bar is fantastic! I tried a piece of my friends and I though it was amazing, I decided to order two single ones just to hold me over until I can order a box or two! The thing that sold me on this products is the nutritional value, the taste is just remarkable and it is 20 grams of protein! \n",
      "I just ordered a box of the Smores bars, opened the first bar, and they are terrible. They taste unbearably sweet and the marshmallow hunks in the bar are very hard and crunchy. I am so disappointed because the reviews so far seemed good. \n",
      "Chocolate Peanut Butter is horrible taste. Mixability of this product is pathetic, extremely hard to mix this powder with water.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Beware of buying this **** item. Very disturb and dissatisfied with BPI supplement.\n",
      "Bulk Muscle is great and does what it is suppose to do, I have been gaining about a a pound and a half a week since using. This product taste great but I recommend blender to mix it up. Worth using for sure.\n",
      "if your looking to put on lean muscle mass you gotta get this gainer. gained about 10 pounds in 2 months while staying lean and not looking bloated, I bought one 5 lb container and it lasts, i suggest not getting cookies and cream because the taste is really far off from cookies and cream,but chocolate peanut butter is great with an extra scoop of peanut butter in your shake. Overall great product as well  and i will continue to buy it.\n",
      "This a good gainer but only get peanut butter.\n",
      "Cookies n cream is horrible omg beyond horrible and normally do not care about taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "But peanut butter is very good!!\n",
      "This mass gainer is the real deal. Great ingredients which is why you pay the premium price. Overall great product. I could see significant mass gains after a couple weeks. Without the loaded sugars, this product surely packs on muscle and not just fatten you up in the process. Chocolate peanut butter flavor was so good. Very thick texture but its delicious. Cookies and cream was not so great tasting on the other hand but it still gets the job done (no clue how it was rated 10/10, chocolate peanut butter was 10 times better). I will continue to use this pruct, it is superior to all other mass gainers, just wish it were a bit friendlier price wise.\n",
      "This is a delicious way to add extra protein and calories to your daily diet! My one complaint would be the amount of powder it takes to make 1 serving. 5 giant scoops is more than I can mix in any of my blender bottles so I usually have to take 1/2 a serving in the morning and 1/2 a serving post workout instead of drinking it all at one time. If there were some way to get the same protein and carbs in just one shake, that would be preferable. This stuff mixes well in water or milk and is probably one of the best flavors of protein I have tried so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purchased Chocolate Peanut Butter right when it was released as I was ending my cut.  The profile for Bulk Muscle is excellent for a mass gainer.  53g protein, only 6g of fats, and 88g of carbs(only 9g sugar).  Sweet potato powder is in the carb complex, so it's a solid food carb source you're getting and not cheap sugars.  High in protein and \"cleaner\" than other gainers.  I always blended up shakes with sometimes using half and sometimes using full servings mixed with almond milk.  It is surprisingly thinner for a mass gainer.  I had expected it to be thick.  Chocolate flavor is very apparent, but unfortunately the peanut butter flavor was majorly lacking.  Excellent gainer but peanut butter flavor needs to be stronger.\n",
      "Excellent product. Visible results within 4 weeks. Highly recommended for Mass/Muscle Gain!!\n",
      "I originally ordered this product when its ratings were in the 9's. after learning more bout ingredients i noticed that this product list Maltodextrin before it list any other protein source as ingredients , this isn't what you want in your mass gainer, it spikes your insulin levels faster that table sugar and floods your bloodstream with glucose. so basically, its sugar but not considered actual sugar so you'll be sucking down fast burning carbs thought the day which is not what u should be doing. And its clumpy and chalky, most times wouldn't even break down in close to full shaker worth of water. leaves a bad after taste. i say go with Quick Mass by All Max. great mass gainer, and they break down whats in it perfectly.\n",
      "Great Product, Just the taste is a bit weird, but it's probably my fault for picking the cookies N Cream instead of the peanut butter. I started using this over Mutant Mass and what really stands out is how much more nutritious this is over it; by this I mean there's not a lot of saturated fats etc. Highly recommend just not the flavor.\n",
      "Quality ingredients, and very effective product. A must have in my bulking stack.\n",
      "Pretty good nutritional profile. Slightly higher in carbs/sugar than I'd like but it's whatever. S'mores doesn't taste too much like s'mores. Maybe the graham cracker, and a little chocolate and marshmallow. Not a very strong flavor.\n",
      "BPI ISOHD Protein is all I use now for my extra protein supplement. Mixes well, tastes fantastic and doesn't upset my stomach like the whey concentrates out there. Make sure you buy the biggest tub, at 2 - 3 scoops a day on workout days, it goes down fast!\n",
      "Well, hit me on the head, every time I think I find the best tasting peanut butter shake. I try a new one. Since I'm not a fan of some of the other flavors I was hesitant. WHAT a MISTAKE. to me this is the best on the market. Mixes easy, no stomach discomfort or issues. Well see how it works in the long run. YUMMY\n",
      "Do the job. \n",
      "Overall I liked the price of this whey isolete. Ingredients look good. I can't give it a bad grade because everything but the taste was good. I tried the peanut butter candy and it tasted more like Carmel, no taste of peanut butter at all. If you aren't a carmel fan don't try that. My friend that I gave this to used it and got sick of the flavor pretty quick, don't buy a 5 lb of a flavor you haven't tried before.\n",
      "I purchased both the limited Snickerdoodle and Chocolate Brownie. By far Snickerdoodle was the tastiest.  Clumping wasn't a huge problem and the tastes were good down to the last drop. I will be looking for more of these proteins. \n",
      "Love the BPI brand, but I noticed the product contains Carrageenan, which could explain the bloating and other GI issues I've been experiencing since using ISO-HD.    \n",
      "\n",
      "I Wish BPI would take this out of their ingredients, 'cause otherwise I'd have given them a solid 10 rating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who knows, maybe someone at BPI is actually reading this and taking this in to account?   If BPI can get rid of potentially harmful substances while retaining their great flavors, prices and transparency, they'd really blossom and boom.\n",
      "Excellent protein powder. I initially bought the S'Mores flavor as it was the highest rated and was a little surprised that it had such positive feedback as I wasn't all that enthusiastic with the taste, but its protein and that's why I drink it, so I can't really complain. Vanilla Cookie tastes great. I think you can fully trust BPI and the ingredients they use to create their protein and cannot recommend this enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE the flavor. I use the Bcaa from this brand and it tastes great also! Highly recommend this brand!\n",
      "Excellent flavor! Mixes well like all of the other flavors I've tried. The taste is dynamic, you get little hints of grahm cracker and then some chocolate and vanilla. I do like the sugar cookie flavor better but this one is really good and I would buy again. The only thing I don't like is the use of sucralose and acesulfame potassium artificial sweeteners. I'd prefer stevia instead. \n",
      "\n",
      "High quality protein.  Mixes amazing.  Calories are low to average.  I prefer 100-110 cals per scoop that is one reason this gets a 9 instead of 10.  Flavors are interesting because the pB candy bar was absolutely awful.  It sounds amazing trust me, you will be dissapointed. However, Smores is one of the best tasting protein powders ive tried.  It is awesome to bake with and in oats.  Love the s'mores a 10/10 for sure.  I like that this protein is very fine and mixes super easily. I'd like to try more flavors of iso hd. whey hd strawberry cake and banana cream have been the best tasting for that flavor IMO same here with this smores. Great tasting.\n",
      "The taste is good. Mixing well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did notice some gains while using this protein. The flavor was not as good as the sample pack I had received from BB. You do have to use water to mix it. If you like to use milk it gets all clumpy and does not mix well and, some of the powder will just sit at the top unmixed. One of the BB program I was on, wanted me to use 2oz of heavy cream with my protein (to up my fat intake). Even adding 2oz of the heavy cream to the water and protein it mixed very bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked this protein product it is a good quality and be best t doesn't bother my stomach at all since I am lactose intolerance. I totally recommended this product. I also ordered different flavor last time but this one was my favorite.\n",
      "BPI sports makes great protein and they certify their products through an outside lab which is nice because you know you are getting legitimately what you pay for.  The Smores flavor was great and is only 3g of carbs and 2 g of fat with 25g of protein, so this fits in well if you count your macros.  I also tried the Vanilla Cookie one, which isn't as good as Smores, but still isn't bad by any means.  The price is a little high , but it is worth it to enjoy your shake instead of just slamming it down.\n",
      "I received a packet of the ISO HD S'Mores protein powder as a free gift with another order and almost immediately placed an order for a 5 pound container. This is by far the best protein powder that I have ever tasted. I mix it with 8-10 ounces of unsweetened vanilla almond milk and find the texture and consistency to be perfect. I also like that there are no fillers and the primary whey isolate ingredient is rapidly absorbed. I highly recommend this protein powder.\n",
      "I tried most of the brands and flavers \n",
      "and i think this is one of the best i ever tried \n",
      "i say go for it with no regrets S'mores flaver is the best\n",
      "This is seriously the most delicious protein powder I've ever tried, and I've tried many. I've been on a hunt for a powder that wasn't too thick but that wasn't super watery either but that was still low carb and this is perfect. Also, the peanut butter candy bar flavor is amazing. Reese's pieces are my downfall and this tastes just like them. I'm so impressed with this protein and can't wait to experiment with making treats in addition to just mixing it with water. \n",
      "This is a pure protein powder that is made up of whey protein isolates. Love the taste and mixes easily. \n",
      "I stopped using powdered protein mixes years ago.  I found myself trying to choke them down due to the chalky taste and texture.  I dreaded taking my supplements and found it to be more of a chore than anything. \n",
      "I received a sample packet of BPI Sports ISO HD, in the Peanut Butter Candy Bar flavor with an order I had placed with BodyBuilding.com.  It sat in my cupboard for a couple months.  Then one day after I had no post workout to use I broke down and opened the sample.  To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.  The taste was amazing and it mixed so nicely.  It was fluffy and light.  No chalkiness at all!  I jumped online and ordered it and also the cookies and cream flavor.\n",
      "I prefer glass bottles and I did notice that the colder the water the better it mixes.  I measure out what I need and put it in a glass bottle then after my workout I add ice water and mix.  Viola! Now I look forward to my post workout TREAT.\n",
      "Mixes better than expected taste is amazing ! Just started it so hope to see good results .\n",
      "S'mores tastes amazing. It's almost like i can taste the roasted marshmallows! And I love the fluffy texture. It's great to bake with too.\n",
      "I just started working out again. Basically for the first time in 3 years. I needed to make changes and I picked this protein because of its low calorie and low carb count. However it's done a lot more. I've seen gains faster than I really expected to after 3 weeks. On top of that I've dropped about ten pounds over the three weeks. I usually take one shake about 30 min after any weight training. I combine this with MP 3:1:2 BCAA's (taken during or immediately after workout), CLA, and L-Carnitine (in which I take both of the last two twice before meals). Plus the S'Mores flavor combined with unsweetened coconut milk tastes fantastic. Only downside is that sometimes it doesn't mix well in a shaker. Just small clumps here and there but that's all. \n",
      "This is the first protein I have tried that I truly don't like and will find hard to use up.  I tried it because I like BPI's other products such as their BCAAs and I picked the flavor because I love peanut butter everything. However, it doesn't taste good and the protein doesn't mix the greatest either. I won't be trying any of the other flavors and I will be going back to Dymatize's Iso-100. \n",
      "Best tasting protein out there... and quick absorbing. It doesn't upset my stomach like some others. I love this. Well worth every penny. I have tried just about every brand. This brand and this product... perfection. \n",
      "The ISO-HD Banana Crème tastes great and it's (fairly) low in calories and sodium.  I had ordered the MusclePharm Banana Cremeb because I like their other offerings but I was so disappointed by their flavor. MF Banana Spilt was awful, it had a metallic taste that stays with you and can't be masked by blending in strawberries for example so I sent it back.\n",
      "I bought the sample on a whim at a local supplement store when I needed to grab a single pack of protein before a workout. Little did I know I had stumbled upon my favorite new protein!\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor/Texture: I've only tried the Banana Cream, but especially considering that I'm not usually a banana flavor fan, this is really good. Sweet without being gross. Mmmm. Also mixes incredibly well and goes down smoother than other powders I've tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:\n",
      "I currently cycle this with Universal Nutrition's Animal Whey in Chocolate Chocolate Chip and PES Select in Snickerdoodle and White Mint. It has the best macros for me personally and has substantial research behind it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, and A+ and a huge recommendation!\n",
      "Bought the small container to try it. Love the taste. Not overwhelming peanut butter taste, but could possibly have more. Easy way to solve that though, just add a tablespoon of natural PB to the shaker! Love it and plan on buying more!\n",
      "The flavor and quality of the protein is excellent. However it mixes like Nesquick. Leaves large lumps of powder.\n",
      "Got the ISOHD at my 6th month of training, coming from the gold standard. Both really great Protein Brands. i was seeking to get more fit were with the GS i was noticing the process was getting slow, i train a lot, 5 days a week at least 2-3 hrs. no extreme diet though, so regular home clean eating. The ISOHD really kicked in within a couple of weeks i noticed i dropped weight (not much but significantly)  and maintained muscle. Really important to eat clean, otherwise your results keep getting delayed. i recommend this product if you seek to get leaner to go along with your everyday clean eating.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the hundreds of protein powders out there, I did my research and took my time and even exercised a little bit of trust. This product is fantastic. For someone who usually doesn't tolerate supplements well, I've had no problems with this product. I found my answer!\n",
      "I've been taking ISO HD and it works great. I take it right after I lift weights and I wake up less sore and been seeing little changes helping with growth. Great Protein powder overall.  \n",
      "This stuff is ten times better than basic, but becareful not to take too much.  I took 5 scoops before I went to bed and woke up with my stomach hurting and I can only take one to 2 scoops a day.  YOU MUST WORK OUT WITH IT.  It is great to take away muscle soreness.  DO NOT TAKE IF YOU DO NOT WORK OUT.  THIS IS NOT A MEAL REPLACEMENT. I DID NOT LIKE IT HAD CARRAGEEAN. BEST PROTEIN OF THIS SAYS IT DOES NOT HAVE CARRAGEEAN.  CARRAGEEAN CAN GIVE YOU BAD STOMACH PROBLEMS AND IS IN MOST WHEY PROTEIN SHAKES.  \n",
      "The flavor is excellent\n",
      "I can be mixed quickly, it seems that expired or it's not original\n",
      "I do not recommend the purchase or experience\n",
      "I use BPI best protein and was looking for something that's quick to digest that I could drink in between weights and cardio. It didn't give me as bad of stomach cramps as regular whey protein. The taste is slightly different from the brownie whey protein but still good. Overall a good product.\n",
      "Highly recommended! Not too sweet and the taste of S'Mores is spot on in my opinion. I mixed it with 8 oz of water, which was just right for my tastes. It's not thick, so if you want something that will keep you full this may not be protein for you. Mixes well, doesn't sit in the stomach and mot chalky at all. Point docked because it's a bit high in calories for an isolate protein. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I am very pleased with this product, however the flavor isn't the absolute best. It also takes a little extra work to get it mixed smoothly when added to water.\n",
      "This is definitely a good quality Protein Powder than most of others in the market.\n",
      "It's a tasty protein , great flavor, but it's not the best protein ever.  It's like any other. For an isolate it's higher than what I like for calories.\n",
      "Taste is aweful, doesnt mix well very clumpy, upset my stomach. \n",
      "Pros: \n",
      "• the flavor is okay, it taste like chocolate milk. Not s'mores\n",
      "• it gets digested super quick\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: \n",
      "• it does not dissolve easily \n",
      "• it made my stomach upset a couple of times.\n",
      "• price\n",
      "• gives weird texture if you want to use it for baking or pancakes and stuff \n",
      "\n",
      "I won't buy again. \n",
      "Vanilla cookie, Great product, average price, mixes well. The flavor is very average, the same with chocolate brownie. There are a lot of excellent products out there for the same price and the same great ingridents, with a better taste. I like to try new products here and there.\n",
      "I am typically a fan of BPI products, but this protein was really quite disappointing. First of all, it should not have \"peanut butter\" in it does not taste of it at all. In fact, the taste is pretty mediocre, but it's mostly disappointing because it is a misleading product.\n",
      "\n",
      "The protein also mixes HORRIBLY. Do not use this protein unless you can always use a blender for it. Most good proteins don't need a blender, but this one you can stir for 10 minutes and there will still be huge chunks. It's just nasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a product that should just not be sold. It is quite sad because BPI makes amazing stuff(banana marshmallow is highly recommended by me)\n",
      "This is thus far the worst tasting protein I have ever had. Not only is the flavor very artificial tasting the texture is as well quite unnatural. I have been using a variety of protein powders for about three years now and have yet to come across one I felt was worth writing a review about. This was so bad I felt it necessary to warn people. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great protein powder. It's pure and high quality, and I love the taste. If you are looking to add high-quality whey without a disgusting taste, try this in vanilla cookie. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am pretty big fan of BPI Sports. I love their BCAA's and feel pretty great while taking it. This product though, didn't do much for me. The taste was pretty good. I could definitely taste the sweeter peanut butter candy bar taste they were going for. My only problem was that it didn't mix very well. I tried it in a shaker cup and my Nutribullet. The texture is the reason why I am rating is so low. I got half way through the container before ordering something else. I decided to just use the protein for baking needs. It mixes a bit better when cooking with it, but not for shakes. \n",
      "\n",
      "***Please note that I only used water for the shakes. I am currently in contest prep and dairy isn't allowed in my diet. It could very well mix much better with milk or other liquids.\n",
      "Just recently really got into lifting and the guy I've been training with advised me to get a protein. The only issue with that is I'm also calorie and carb restricting to trim some fat and a lot of protiens aren't \"diet friendly\". After looking around for a while I decided to try BPI's ISO-HD. Can't beat it's stats and price and after using it for about a month now I plan on getting more. Taste and mixes great. A really awesome product BPI has made here. Would definitely recommend to anybody looking for a \"diet friendly\" protein or just a good protien in general.   \n",
      "So this product is one of my new favorites. When looking for a new protein, I care about how well it mixes, how good it tastes, and the macros. Using a regular shaker bottle and the recommended amount if water, this protein is super smooth and never gritty. Like I said, I use water, and the taste is still awesome! The s'mores is true to the name. Seriously it is SO GOOD. I bet it tastes even better with milk or almond milk. The macros on this are also really great, I love that there's not too many calories for 25 grams of protein. Carbs are low as well. So I feel good about adding this into my regiment. Completely recommend! \n",
      "I really really like this protein. The flavors and quality are phenomenal, love that you don't have to worry about getting cheated on protein content. \n",
      "Amazing Vanilla flavor. Especially since it has only 2g of carbs per serving (the nutrition label on bb's site says there is 3g of carbs per serving however the label on my bottle says 2g) and only 1g of fat per serving. Even the smell of the protein smells wonderful (some protein powders smell like toxic or crap for whatever reason)\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had ON Whey Gold Standard Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, which taste's like absolute junk compared to Bpi. I haven't tried any other flavors.  But for Vanilla I'm definitely sticking with Bpi for a long time. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Muscles feel great the next day. Still getting weight loss on this product (trying to). Got the peanut butter candy bar flavour. Literally tastes like reeses. So good.\n",
      "i have tried just about everything to get a good tasting ISO Whey product and finally found something i can drink and not have to choke it down. i have tried the Banana Cream Pie and it was good but had a strange after taste but the Vanilla Cookie is perfection for a protein shake. i wont spend big money on anything because i cant afford it but this is very affordable and i will continue to buy. \n",
      "It's ok. Tastes good. My only complaint is that it foams up a bit. I feel like the last two gulps are bubbles. \n",
      "Excellent profile for an isolate.  120 calories with 25g of protein.  Mixes easily in a shaker bottle with water or milk with no clumps.  Very smooth and a tad thicker than other isolates I've tried which is a positive!  Vanilla Cookie is absolutely delicious!  One of the best vanilla flavors with an actual cookie taste to it.  I look forward to it after every workout.  Banana Cream Pie is very good and smooth.  Hint of pie crust flavor.  But I'm addicted to Vanilla Cookie and have 3 tubs at the moment.  Highly recommend!\n",
      "I really like the flavor of the cookies and cream, mixes well and bpi states zero fillers and third party tested so how can you go wrong?! Just reordered trying the chocolate brownie this time!\n",
      "Ok I tried Bpi products because at least I know what they put in there product is actually there. I tried the iso hd I love it. But I felt it was more better for my uses as a snack on break time at work. Then directly after workout. So I keep a 2pd tub at work will I buy again for that purpose? Yes I will!\n",
      "Best tasting protein I've ever tried! Quality for price value is excellent. Doesn't clump up and blends vey well. 10/10 Will definitely buy again. \n",
      "This taste the best with very little water when mixing. It looses alot of taste with too much water. When mixing in a blender, add 1 scoop of peanut butter with eggwhites and ice andbits the. Est shake i ever ha. Mixes perfect evereverytime. Will def be buying more. Only other one i like as much as this is iso 100 by dymatize. I will try the vanilla cookie next. \n",
      "Taste is similar to the Banana Marshmallow Whey HD but this is the first isolate that I have tried that clumps up in a shaker. Usually isolates mix very easily in a shaker, but this one seems to clump up quick and is very sticky when you drink it. Generally happy with BPI products so I am hoping the other flavors are better\n",
      "I've been using this for 2 months. It has a nice profile and does everything it is supposed to. The cookies and cream flavor is very good. No clumps and I just funnel it into a half empty water bottle and shake a little. Nice little pieces of cookie as well. Overall, a great value.\n",
      "I Bought the 4.9lbs Cookies and Cream ISO whey and I have to say it was by far the Nastiest Flavor they make. It tastes nothing like cookies and Cream. Should've stuck with the Vanilla Cookie it is the best tasting one by far. I wish I could send it back and get a different kind.\n",
      "I am fairly new to protein powders but I have tried a few. I love this one!. Mixes completely and tastes great. I use it immediately after my workouts. \n",
      "Love these proteins, great taste...i highly recommended it.\n",
      "I absolutely love this product. BPI has really found a gem in the rough with this protein powder. I love anything banana, so I was excited to see a banana-flavored profile. The banana cream pie tastes exactly like it's namesake and leaves no bitter or disgusting aftertaste (thank you, BPI). I enjoy the profile and appreciate the full list of ingredients being disclosed. I highly recommend BPI ISO HD (try the banana cream pie!).\n",
      "A really good addition to my diet. taste great when mixed with Almond milk and frozen fruit!\n",
      "I ordered 3 out of the 4 flavors when they had, during a good sale going on. I have to say that after trying other ISO I was expecting the watered down texture and less full taste. All 3 of the flavors were amazing. Great tasting, they mix decently well and go great with oatmeal in the mornings. I am so impressed how well the nail the flavors. I will be a customer as long as this great quality keeps up.\n",
      "Excellent flavor, mix well.\n",
      "Decided to give this a try with the BB.com launch sale.  Keeping in mind it's isolate - I expected thin, watery but I feel this product fails at flavor.  Tastes like sweetener to me, def not getting much chocolate brownie.  It looks chocolate but falls short.  I'm going to try another brand of isolate next time to compare.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as digestion, I've had no issues using this whey.\n",
      "i say great work for BPI, keep it up, clean great prduct withoit any fillers or nonsence, whoever is looking for stronger taste please check the juck area, this is ISO \n",
      "This was awful. The taste was very watered down even with the minimum water. It also was horrible to mix and I couldn't get all the chunks to mix right. Definitely not worth it!\n",
      "Does not mix as great as the ON Hydro Whey does.  Tastes ok.  Slightly tastes like brownie mix but it's a very fine line between rich taste and watered down.\n",
      "Best taste and Great pumps.. And the pump experience increases with the continued use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blueberry Lemon Freeze is the BEST tasting supp I've ever had...\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes very well without leaving much granules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Citrus Dew, Apple Pear tastes very well as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "BPI does awesome job in their flavoring department.. Just hngggggg....\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is and always will be great! I only give it a 9/10 for the fact that I didn't get a complete neurological motivation from it, although I felt some. But the energy lasted the whole workout and was incredibly clean and smooth feeling. The pump aspect was great...for me the replaces the need for a separate pump/no supplement. There really is not need for both. Because even if you use hemovol (the al time strongest pump product) the pump effect starts to subside after about a week of use, go with a clean basic lasting pre workout and just ******* grow. (Taste was fire)\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall PUMP HD is a 10 but as far as the pump factor I give it about a 6 or 7. This is great stim free pre workout and I love it for that. I just didn't feel like I got very much of an actual \"pump\" from PUMP HD. Which was a little disappointing but everyone is different so this doesn't mean you wouldn't have a great experience with it. Blueberry lemon was good, bpi never disappoints in the flavor category, but it was just a little too tangy for me. \n",
      "You should definitely give PUMP HD a try if your looking for a preworkout that will keep you motivated your entire workout and ample clean energy to get you going even after a long day at work. \n",
      "I was skeptical buying a pre-workout sans caffeine, but i workout after work and won't sleep if i take a regular pre-workout. Tried it, and really like it- its not an explosive energy burst by any means, but it made a definite difference and gave me a needed kick! Also, the apple pear is freakin delicious. Will buy again. \n",
      "Love this stuff. Recommend to everybody! Gives you a good pump and make muscles feel full. Helps get through those last couples reps and sets. Could tell a huge difference when I don't take it! \n",
      "This is an awesome, stimulant-free preworkout supp. I drink this throughout my workout stacked with an electrolyte supp and I get pumps like crazy. I know there are opposing views on whether \"pump\" is beneficial to muscle gains in strength, but dammit if I don't feel like I could lift 10 people while consuming this. \n",
      "This was a pretty good product. It wasn't as good as some others that I have tried but it is still good. You have to make sure you drink plenty of water before you take it PLUS a bunch of water after, for those that don't know the obvious. Mixed well, flavor tasted great and I got it at a Buy One Get One Free so it really worked out for me. \n",
      "The flavor wasn't bad but didn't mix very well. It didn't give me the rush before I started my workout like my old pre-workout did.\n",
      "I was really disappointed with this product. The flavour wasn't bad it actually tasted like a watermelon drink. My main issue was that it had no affect on me, I didn't get any more energy by taking it. I actually had a really hard time breathing during and after my workout, I don't know of it was related to this product or just a coincidence but either way I won't be using it again.\n",
      "This product worked best for me when mixing it with a pre workout. Gives you a crazy pump if mixed with the Mr1. Gave me extra boost and strength to do a solid workout. I will buy again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just tried this.\n",
      "Loved it. Gave me a long-lasting buzz. Sustained for much longer than expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavour is good. Easy mix.\n",
      "Will continue to use!\n",
      "A lot of the ingredients shown in the label are unfamiliar to me, but boy, this works. Pump products really don't mean anything, but with pre-contest low-carb glycogen-depleted body, I thought I'd give this a try. I've tried other pump products from other companies, but they only work at 2-3 scoops, so a bottle never lasts a month, but with this, 1 scoop does its job. Not sure if I will continue to use this off-season, but I'm very pleased with the pump this product provides. \n",
      "This is now one of my favorite non-stim pre workout / pump enhancer supplement.  I used many other supplements in this category but this is one of the best in my opinion.  The pump is superb.  Also, even though there is no caffeine, I did experience and increase in energy and endurance.  Lastly, the flavor I have tried is so good and refreshing.  It has a true exotic fruit taste, not just an artificial fruit punch like many others.  Everyone should give this try!\n",
      "have tried a few different amino acid drinks this has been my least favorite didn't feel much out of it\n",
      "I enjoy just about All of BSN's products... I can include Aminox Edge... I lover the taste however I do still keep the classic AminoX in my arsenal as I train at night sometimes and don't need a caffeine spike during those hours... OVERALL GREAT.\n",
      "This came free with my purchase of Amino X so I added it to my cart and figured I try it out. The taste by itself is incredibly sour, almost like eating the candy \"warheads\" and it's definitely not unflavored one bit. I did end up mixing it with my blue raspberry pre-workout which made the flavor mildly good in taste but still sour nonetheless. It does state that it causes a tingling sensation which I would describe it as that feeling after falling asleep on your hand or arm and that sensation you get after the numbness starts going away, but throughout your entire body. At first I felt like it was giving me a little boost but not sure if that was just in my mind, then all of a sudden it started making me feel nauseated so I had to stop using it.\n",
      "The product came free with my purchase, I decided to add it to my pre workout and creatine. The beta alanine is very sour and its flavor cannot be masked, the effects varied from a mild tingle to making me feel nauseas. It upset my stomach the more I took it and now have stopped using it. Would not recommend or use again, I never noticed more endurance from using this product. \n",
      "Ordered amino x and had this come for free. I would always mix it with the Amino's so I didn't notice much of the flavor. But the other day I tried mixing it with coffee and man.. I did not expect it. It was like drinking salt water. I realized why the Amino's tasted a little sour. I still get a mild tinglyness to it though. but still! Quite disappointed.\n",
      "LOOK CLOSELY AT THE LABEL! \n",
      "I thought I was purchasing a product with 3.6 grams of beta-alanine (as CarnoSyn) per serving. Its actually a proprietary blend mixed with beta-alanine HCl. Since CarnoSyn is the only beta-alanine that is backed with research showing its effectiveness, I was very disappointed to find out I bought something else. Yes, there is CarnoSyn in this blend, but I contacted BSN and they would not tell me specifically how much is in their product. Only to say that the ingredients are listed from 'most to least'. Meaning you could be getting as little as 1.8 grams of CarnoSyn per serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst part about this is the beta-alanine HCl causes the powder to have an unpleasant sour taste to it. No matter what you mix it with, you will taste the sourness. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a longtime BSN consumer I have to say that this new product of theirs is terrible and I will now be purchasing a different beta-alanine product. NOW beta-alanine is 100% CarnoSyn and has a lower cost per serving. \n",
      "\n",
      "NA\n",
      "It works well. Almost no soreness and good strength gains. \n",
      "I always get water retention with creatine, and this one was no different. I don't normally respond to creatine but this one worked well.\n",
      "Good but there's better out there.\n",
      "It has virtually no taste lol, its like a lightly flavored water. Doesn't mix that well.\n",
      "its not my first time with cellmass, but with 2.0 yes.\n",
      "I take it with my shake every morning and in my big shake (home made weight gainer, 400ml 2 % milk, 1.5-2 scoop whey, 1 banana, 1 cup oatmeal,frozen strawberry, greek yogourt 4 spoon, 1 scoop cellmass => blended !) . \n",
      "Artic Berry taste really awesome and give a very nice taste to my chocolat whey.\n",
      "Its BSN so you dont exactly know how much of everything is in it (5 gr mix creatine, 3 gr glutamine.. per two scoop). So dont buy it until it's buy one get one free.\n",
      "I workout 6-7 time a week (split training of course) I take a bunch of supp (whey,preworkout,bcaa all day long,carnitine,fish oil,multivitamine,zma..) so im never shor more than one day or half. Its help me maybe getting more fuller.. but its not the 3 gr of glutamine that will change everything cause we need more than 3gr..\n",
      "\n",
      "So yes it's a good creatine blend that taste good, dissolve quickly. no stomach issues.no gritty. no watter weight wich is good, because we all know that if you gain weight fast with creatine it's because its all water !\n",
      "Cons : prop blend (bsn as always) , would like having more glutamine , not a true 50 serving (25 real) ­ . Next time i wanna try Celltech  when it will be on sale\n",
      "Tastes great and mixes reasonable well.  I like to take a scoop after my morning workout and another scoop before bed.  Since I started taking this product I have noticed that I recover more quickly and experience less muscle soreness the next day.\n",
      "this product is so good, it will make you wanna drink it just like a normal drink, when you open it up for the first time arctic berry smell amazing, and even better flavour!!\n",
      "recommend it to everyone!! \n",
      "i take it once a day, and i can definitely feel and see the impact on my training.\n",
      "I have tried other recovery products with and without creatine. This has been one of the best for me and I keep coming back to it because it really reduces the soreness when you push a little harder or lift a little heavier.  None of their flavours have that excessive, sickly sweet taste that comes from too much artificial sweetener. Every BODY is different and this is one that works very well for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "very good product i use it post workout since i use CREADE pre workout...the only negative i may have is i don't feel it really helps in \"recovery\" i'm always sore wether i take it or not...but since i'm seeing major change in my body i will believe it works good for me\n",
      "exelent leanmass\n",
      "Awesome product. Very happy with the recovery results seen in product. My flavour was orange. However it was not on the drop down. Taste good. Seems to be good value for money. The tub is large. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product, great taste and mixes well. I've reordered this several times and will continue to do so.\n",
      "This is a great addition to the NOexplode, AminoX stack. I train for 2-3 hours per session and rarely am painfully sore the next day. I also see consistent healthy gains from the BSN products\n",
      "Decent product with great taste. Mouth's really dry/thirsty after drinking it every time post-workout. Realize I probably only need creatine and not the glutamine and other ingredients since i dont know if they actually work or not. Personally prefer beast creatine\n",
      "Really loved the product. Actually this is a good thing to add to BCAAs to have a glutamine matrix (L-Glutamine AND peptides) and your daily high quality creatine for the day. With extra hydrolysed aminos. It also contains a plant, banaba leaf extract, that actually spike the insulin and this is a good thing after the workout because it helps assimilate the carbs (you need to replenish the muscles with carbs after the work out) and insulin is anabolic. The buy one get one free deal makes the price moooore than correct for a creatine. And the taste is awesome.\n",
      "I have seen great results with this product! All of my lifts have gone up and it definitely speeds up recovery time. It tastes pretty good but make sure you stay well hydrated!\n",
      "I have been using this because of the amazing buy one get one free deals that come along every month or so. Great product! Gives you a solid recovery blend including good creatine dosage. I personally take a serving before and one after which helps my get through and minimize how sore I am post workout. Good for the deal but definitely better BCAA blends on the market. Would recommend when 50 servings become buy one get one.\n",
      "Great product! Solid Results! I love the grape but not a big fan of the watermelon. I have seen good results after taking this for ten weeks. I have gained about 12 pounds of muscle, went up about 40 lbs on bench and about 60 on squats if not more. I was into bodybuilding for about 15 years and have just came off of a seven year hiatus. So some of my gains can be attributed to muscle memory. Nonetheless, this is a good choice for any lifter. Take two scoops a day for best results. Generally, I take this as a post work out. \n",
      "very chalky\n",
      "BSN in hole is a great company that makes quality products. Cellmass is just one of the many great tasting outstanding products. watermelon taste great easy to mix and used pre and post workout it makes my muscles feel fuller and gives incredible pumps. The research behind it shows that it just works, use it and email me in a month and just say thanks for the review. \n",
      "This is a great intra and post workout shake! Keeps you pushing through your sets and keeps the fatigue from setting in too early. I love how many things it is all in one supplement so I don't have to have a counter full of containers anymore. Definitely something everyone should add to their supplement list!\n",
      "This products does work wonders. I take it post workout on training days and first thing in the morning on non training days. The Arctic Berry flavor is amazing. It mixes very easily and does not fill me up so I can still have my post workout protein shake. I would highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Thought it would taste like N.O. explode pre-workout blue raz which I am obsessed with. This is chalky and milky... It does what it needs to do, but I take so long to drink it because it tastes so bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aminos and Creatine in 1! I take a scoop with my morning smoothie and add the 2nd one to a bottle of water i drink during training. So far have added about 10 lbs of weight over 1.5 months  and have increased all weights during training an d# of reps... I tried this product before and not the version 2.0 but only did one scoop per day and saw no changes so im very happy this time around \n",
      "\n",
      "I am very pleased with this product. I've been taking it for three weeks now and feel that I'm getting more out of my workouts. I've gotten stronger and have gained a couple more pounds of muscle. After a intense training session I drink cellmass and the next day I am not nearly as sore as I usually would be. I highly recommend that anyone serious about gaining strength and size use this.\n",
      "This product has not let me down yet. I first tried it when they sold it in the packets to mix in water bottles, which i wish i could still find. Mixes, 7.5, taste 9.9. If your looking for a great post-workout during the day this is what you need.\n",
      "Excellent flavor and mixes well with very little water. Since taking it I have had no recovery issues and have pleny of energy at the gym even after doing higher weight and more sets than before. Great product.\n",
      "I am not sure why people saying it doesn't mix well, I absolutely have no problems drinking it. I purchased the artic berry flavor and it's great. No bubbles no mess. I just use one scoop in 8oz of water (yes I have chosen water), put it in my shaker and just add ice to it and it tastes like a gaterade. However I don't let it just sit in my cup. I drink it pretty fast within 5 minutes post workout. If u do let it set in your cup...The mixture will flow to the bottom.  I have just started working out so I take this post work out and I believe that since I been working out, I could be way much sore than this. The mixture between, stretches,  any my protein shakes post work out makes a difference. Hope this helps!!\n",
      "I bought this mostly for the purpose of recovery, and used a scoop before and a scoop after my workout. As far as recovery goes, it's fairy good. I feel less sore after my workout, but it's not as effective as I thought. However, as for intraworkout, this stuff is great! It gives me a ton of endurance and I was pleasantly surprised by the number of extra reps I could do. So in that aspect Cellmass 2.0 is amazing. \n",
      "As far as mixing goes, it's like the others say. It's foamy so you have to let it settle, and there seems to always be some undissolved powder at the bottom. Luckily the taste makes up for that. If you are confused about what arctic berry is, it's basically cherry flavor, and it is delicious. I combined a scoop of this with a scoop of Cellucor C4 watermelon, and it was one of the best fruit punches I've ever had!\n",
      "Felt a very smooth & clean recovery.  Muscles felt replenished. Tastes amazing!\n",
      "Decent flavor if I used two scoops, but I tend to drink a larger drink due to my size.  The product does not mix very well.  I always find clumps in in the bottom even after shaking it like a madman before each drink.  I thought other products had a better flavor and provided better results.  However, the low calorie is a key component and it has zero sugar.\n",
      "Solid post workout gives you what you need and its quick and easy to drink.  Doesn't fill me up so i can get home in the morning and start my meals right away.  I like both Grape and the blue raz flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This supp might not make sense for many people but I do like what it offers. The arctic berry flavor is unique and very tasty. I always looked forward to taking this while I was using it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Used this and the original with good success. Solid product, but Creature seems to work better for me so I've since switched to it. \n",
      "I have taken this stuff on and off for several years with great results.  I have tried other products but always come back to cellmass.  Taste good too.\n",
      "BSN does it again! Excellent product overall. Feel less fatigue the next day, and soreness is a bare minimum, so I can smash another body part the next day. I'd recommend you just put the power in your mouth and wash it down with some water. It doesn't mix well, and there's a lot left in the shaker cup after.\n",
      "Very impressed with the product. I've been taking it before and after intense workouts and those **** leg days for 7-8 months now and I've experienced faster recovery and significantly reduced soreness. The Blue Raz flavor makes it easy to take. Definitely a place on the shelf for this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Works great but the Arctic Berry tastes like Playdoh.\n",
      "For me is the best recovery is Cellmas2.0 + AminoX or SCIVATION Xtend\n",
      "I am not a big fan of having to load up on multiple supplements before, during and after a workout. I hate having tubs and tubs of proteins, creatines, nitric oxides and aminos stacked on top of my fridge. So I like to limit this. BUT I have worked through quite a few tubs of this Cellmass 2.0 and I gotta say...I love it. I definitely notice a size increase when taking this post workout. And I mean RIGHT after I put my last weight down for the day/night I am drinking it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to change up their supplement stacks and/or add some size. It's relatively cheap and delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "that just do nothing\n",
      "Cell Mass is great taste wise and it help with my workouts. I feel like it helps me get all reps in and bump up the weight \n",
      "I really love the portion size and the taste. I can tell a difference with my recovery using this vs just protein. I have had better results from other products but none compare price wise at least at the buy two get one.\n",
      "Cell mass is an awesome supplement. It really aids in my recovery. I stack this with Syntha-6 Isolate, nitrix 2.0 and N.O. \n",
      "Arctic Berry is pretty tasty, sort of like cherry kool-aid, and less water is better for the taste.  I haven't used Creatine in many years and I have been using Cell Mass for about 2 weeks now and I have noticed that I am not as tired towards the end of my workout and can lift more weight towards the end than I could before.  I haven't noticed any weight gain and no stomach issues with this product.\n",
      "Long time creatine monohydrate user.  Heard good things about this product and was looking forward to the comparison.  Unfortunately, I'm getting intense headaches about an hour after every dose.  Have taken seven servings so far and the headaches soon follow.  Have increased my water uptake x2 with no change.\n",
      "Great recovery and strength product! I have been taking this product for about 3 months and I notice greater recovery time after heavy days and definitely more strength. I usually take 1 dose as soon as I wake up and 1 dose after my workout. Highly recommend.\n",
      "I like using cellmass in the winter when bulking. I usually take it year round when doing strongman training. I switched gears to bodybuilding and am cycling off of it. I have always taken BSN products pretty much from the beginning. I enjoy all their products and recommend to everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The best out there! love this stuff.\n",
      "Great supp.  Take it daily and have seen results.  Mixes well.  \n",
      "product works great as an intra-workout! love the flavor too!\n",
      "I tried it for a month and it's working. Recommended  \n",
      "Great product. Top of the Line \n",
      "Creatine of the year.. Cant argue with that. Didnt have much for body weight gains while using this but I definitely saw results and it got me into creatine. Currently trying Cell Tech but I still got a few tubs of this left that I plan on using again when I cut. Blue Raz was horrendous but absolutely love the taste of the arctic berry. Seal a scoop with a little water inside a small jar and shake it up, works great n no need to keep dirtying shaker cups. The glutamine and amino acids as well just help wrap this procuct up as a powerful tool to add to anyones supplement arsenal. Recommend for sure.\n",
      "Flavor is great! I am using it from the last 2 months now. I do not see euphoric effect which I noticed in similar other Creatine. Do I need to stick with it for a bit more time to see better results, is something I am not sure of. I hope it works for me. Still sticking to it to see results......\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great post w/o recovery supplement. BSN always has the best tasting stuff on the market, hands down! This also tastes great, I got the Grape flavor. It has Creatine, the good kind the HCL and every other recovery agent you need. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a post w/o recovery. I have been using this product for 3 months now and absolutely know it works well. You can also drink this anytime not just post w/o.\n",
      "I like this product and saw some nice results....I would purchase this again\n",
      "\n",
      "BEST POST WORKOUT EVER\n",
      "BEST GLUTAMINE\n",
      "\n",
      "MY RECOVERY ITS FASTER BECAUSE OF IT\n",
      "\n",
      "At first I was skeptical if this would be a product worth taking but been taking for about 2 weeks now and I'm a believer. This stuff rocks.\n",
      "I have taken this supplement for about 4-5 months and have seen a huge increase in strength, my bench max went from 235 to 315 power cleans from 225 to 285 and squats from 425 to 495. Great product definitely  recommend this for anyone trying to increase strength.\n",
      "Very Goood for recovery and amazing in taste!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried several products when I began training and after much research and consumption, Cellmass is my sole choice for Glutamine.  I have seen results with my appearance as well as my strength.   \n",
      "THE BEST PRODUCT, AND THE FALVOR IS GREAT\n",
      "BSN went above with this one. I love the creatine matrix, and recovery feels great with the glutamine. High quality product I definitely recommend it!\n",
      "While this product is nearly impossible to review I still feel better using it then not. Some ingredients in it I was taking already so it is nice to have an all in one but at the same time I still use other stuff with it. Taste is not that bad either. All around it has good stuff and is a quick single item that you can use until you get home.\n",
      "This is phenomenal, Wasn't sore the day after leg day and I went all out. I usually use it when in a Caloric deficit since it has BCAA's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tasty\n",
      "Blue Raz has a nice flavor!\n",
      "Oh how I love CellMass. I tried the grape first and the easiest way to describe it was it tasted like what I envision ******** tasting like. It said 4 oz, I literally did a shot to get it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it's effects, I loved them, I loved that I could get a hard workout in, take this, along with my protein and not be anywhere near sore over the next couple of days.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend this to anyone. Not so much the grape, unless you wanna do the \"Oh my gawd this is nasty\" dance while standing in the gym. \n",
      "The watermelon is phenominal!\n",
      "Excellent Glutamine! Mixes well and the watermelon tastes great. I stack it with modern Bcaa which also comes in watermelon. I take both as a post work drink. Very happy with cellmas!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love Cell Mass 2.0. I'm an Ectomorph so it's difficult for me to put on a lot of mass but with Cell Mass 2.0 I have put on 11lbs of muscle this year! I love this stuff, a must for any ectomorph\n",
      "Great product defiantly seen gains using it but did not like the watermelon flavor \n",
      " \n",
      "I like this product. Great taste and great after workout recover for me. I notice I recovered better and was t as sore after workouts. Gained some muscle off of this but had some water weight too. Overall I think for the money it's good product and would recommend it   \n",
      "good product and taste normal, decent reducing agent after the workout.\n",
      "This is a great product for recovery and sustaining gains.  Dose amounts are small so you don't get that bloated feeling after chugging.  I can use this product with just about any stack and the creatine is high grade.  Its a good product for morning recovery and immediate post workout.  Taste is just an added plus.  I have tried most of all the flavors and found them equally up to my expectations. \n",
      "Flavor was a little weak, and didn't see any greater gains than using creatine monohydrate. Very pricey for a creatine product considering you have to take 2 servings daily.\n",
      "Its great for post work out and recovery. I'd say its above average but I can't tell if I miss a day. So maybe not as great as my last post workout supp\n",
      "I use it as intra workout supplement...\n",
      "\n",
      "It is great! I feel stronger and more refreshed after using it....\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome product! You should buy and take about 3 tubs to get the full benefit of it. It really improved with my strength and size gains, I'll never take another creatine product other than this. Can't wait to get back on it in the winter!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This a great supplement. I have seen more gains in the past two weeks with it than a month without it. The taste is just like kool-aid but it foams a little too much and there are always two or three little pieces after you mix it.\n",
      "This is one of my favorites! I have never had a problem with BSN products. I gained 7 pounds in a couple of months. cell mass2.0 is a little fizzy but the taste is great and the outcome is great! I do recommend this and also try stacking with N.O.xplode and syntha-6. you will see a positive outcome.\n",
      "Effectiveness: 10/10. Great creatine/recovery product. I did't feel as sore after a workout and it really made me feel better the next day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: 10/10. The arctic berry tasted amazing and the smell of it got me excited to drink it. Definitely one of the best tasting supplements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Value: 9/10. Not too bad, but for a creatine/glutamine/bcaa product I have found less expensive products. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: 10/10. Probably my favorite creatine/recovery on the market. Mixes great and enhances recovery. \n",
      "This stuff is awesome! I dont feel drained if I dont get enough water throughout the day and the taste is spectacular from other creatine I have used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Want to get more, worked really well twice a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Started taking this product over 6 years ago and seen great results. Just starting to get back into working out and this was on my must have for supplements list. I take it once in the morning when I wake up and 10-15 minutes post workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally I liked the 1st version of CellMass better, if its not broke don't fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "its the best creatin and glutamine formula!!!\n",
      "First of the taste is manageable. It is really annoying however that if you shake it, half of it turns into foam. Took 1 scoop a day before workouts and noticed slight improvements in strength and endurance. Two weeks ago I switched to two scoops before workouts and the difference was very noticeable. My endurance improved greatly and I've noticed an overall improvement in my physique. Pretty good deal for the price as well.\n",
      "Being someone who depended simply on whey protein for recovery I was never interested in any post workout drinks. As my training began to intensify though, so did my bodies demands for proper supplementation. I decided to try out Cellmass after reading several reviews, and I'm glad I did. I recovery so much more quickly now, and combined with my Syntha-6 these two make an amazing stack. I've tried it out in the Arctic berry and its pretty awesome, but then again BSN always makes amazing tasting products which is why I lean towards them for most of my product supplementation.  Simpy put if you're looking for something to speed up your recovery, and get you back into the gym asap this is the product for you. \n",
      "The best recovery aid i have used. Always seems to help me be ready to go after even the most intense workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just finished this and it works great. I only used post workout with my protein. Don't know if that is correct either, but thats how I took it. Gained some size and strenght, tastes decent as well.\n",
      "\n",
      " i 50/50 if it works but i feel rejuenized after i take during the day.\n",
      "I like the overall product. I do not like the flavor. Its extremely tart and I personally almost throw it up every time. If you chase it with water or gatorade there isnt a bad after taste. I am not really sore after my workout and i work out fairly hard. I follow Kris Gethin's workout as hard as my body will let me it works well for recovery when stacked with HyperFX\n",
      "I've been experiencing really good strength increases while using this product. My recovery has also been vastly improved with almost no soreness post workout.\n",
      "Been on this for 2 days and worked out hard yesterday with ZERO soreness today after taking cellmass twice yesterday and after workout today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like this product a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried many, many creatine products, but this one delivers good results without making me feel like I just ate a 1/2 cup of sugar.  Bloat is minimal, and strength, endurance, and recovery time without too much lactic acid burn are all positive effects I noticed.  The flavor is tasty, and it mixes easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only beef (and it is not the products fault, but rather the nature of this type of product) is that when opened, humidity causes the product to \"cake\" if not consumed in an expeditious manner (IE use the recommended daily servings daily until the tub is gone, vs. putting a lid on it and letting it sit for a while) -  I often \"cycle\" on and off, so when my tub sits for six weeks, it tends to cake.\n",
      "This stuff tasted great and it did it's job because I never truly got sore.\n",
      "I loved the original cellmass however this new concentrated formula does not improve on the old version. If anything it is a backward step. My recovery is no better than it was without cellmass 2. My recovery has slightly improved by doubling the dose but makes it quite expensive. I will only run the original version as long as it is available. \n",
      "Super excited to try the new cellmass because of the new flavors. Artic berry was getting boring. Tried the watermelon, not as sweet as previous version of cellmass. Havent noticed any change in gains or losses from previous version. Still a great recovery product. Too many recovery products are harsh on stomach. Still love my cellmass.\n",
      "BSN Creatine DNA series is a great micronized monohydrate creatine. Very happy with this product.\n",
      "Very clean, straight-forward creatine supplement that dissolves well and doesn't impart any off flavors.  I mix mine in with a daily protein and BCAA combination and it does exactly what I expect of it.  The only reason I didn't rate higher than I did is that some combination of the powder and/or container material causes an impressive static response.  So it's nearly impossible to get a portion out without dirtying one's hand, shaker bottle, or counter top.  It won't stop me from re-ordering, just figured other potential buyers should be aware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes great, and I don't even notice a difference in my protein shake when stacking. Unflavored is perfect, and i'm definitely feeling strength gains. Awesome product!\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is messy, clumpy and does not break down as well as others I have tried. I ordered because it was on sale, and am glad I did not pay full price for it given the poor quality. \n",
      "Really good for stacking. Is working well as my strength gains are rising. makes my protein shake a lil chalky But other than that it's all good!\n",
      "\n",
      "My review is... meh... I've tried many different creatine supplements and this one didn't do much for me. Also it's hard not to make a mess unlike some other creatine supplements I've tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes well.  No flavor as advertised.  But beware this stuff is highly sensitive to static electricity.  Will jump all over your counter.  Also sticks heavily to container, you will need to scrape it off with a spoon for that last serving.\n",
      "I love adding creatine to doing Body Beast.  Seems like its helping.  The only thing a little funny is when you scoop this kind of creatine its hard to not make  a mess.  It's weird when you scoop it and dump it into a glass it \"jumps around\" on its own a bit and very hard to get 100% of it in the glass.  Sounds a little weird but thats the only thing that's kinda odd about it.  Can't wait to see what results it gives me though!\n",
      "It's Creatine Mono, its cheap, unflavored and mixes well.  That's all you need to know.\n",
      "Amazing value for money, high quality. \n",
      "I add 1 scoop of this to my pre workout (Cellucor c4 ripped) and 1 scoop to my post workout (PHD Diet whey or NITROTECH)\n",
      "10/10\n",
      "BSN Glutamine DNA is a great anticatabolic product to use while cutting body fat. Helps to prevent burning muscle over other energy sources. Product works great for me. \n",
      "Very affordable supplement to add to the mix, with great results on the recovery process.  I've added this to my post workout flovored Amino-X.  I love that this is unflavored, which can be mixed with anything.\n",
      "My favorite BSN supplement ! \n",
      "Wanted to try this product but received a bad quality item.. The product was like it was been damped and the powder has turned into solid particles. Will be returning it. \n",
      "Best supplements when cutting\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "man talking about the recovery process being cut in half use to take me 3 days to recover now its about a 1-2 days less sucking more bulking \n",
      "Really solid product. Straight ahead unflavored Glutamine, at an awesome price. Mixes really well, and I'm definitely noticing faster/better recovery after using the product for a couple weeks. Perfect addition to my current stack - highly recommended. \n",
      "Great product from BSN. Also love that it’s unflavored and easy to mix so I can change up my shakes instead of being just stuck with one flavor.\n",
      "I can tell when I don't take this after a good hard workout. I'm a lot less sore if I take it after big workout days. This works great \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This a commodity product at a good value. It mixed easily and worked well for my needs.\n",
      "I have only used this a few days, but I will not take it again. It has been causing my blood pressure to spike, making my skill feel on fire, and turning my ears/face/neck red. I also felt really dizzy with it yesterday and had to lay down for a while. In the weeks preceding taking it, I've been building up a tolerance to caffeine (I don't consume much caffeine regularly otherwise), so I don't think it is just the effect from the caffeine. I'm not sure what is causing the reaction, but I don't plan to keep taking it to find out.\n",
      "Been using this product for several months.  Feel more energetic and noticed that my metabolic rate has increase; simply what I eat gets digested quickly.  I take one in the morning before workout, and another in the afternoon.  Do not see this as a magic bullet solution.  You have to work out and do your part.  I can say that it helps with my cardio, as I get better endurance.  Overall, I am happy with iy and recommend it without reservations.  Remember that this is a supplement........do not expect miracles if you do not do your part.\n",
      "this product is great for energy , I take one before work and it gives me enough energy for the entire day , 10 hours shifts that's why I am giving it a 10 rating but as far as fat burning id say it does stack up however I love this product for the reason above. If I need to do a lot of hard labor I take two but it does raise your heart rate quite a bit so be cautious , take as directed.\n",
      "I haven't use the product for long but when I take it I take 2 pills and it gives me very little energy even though I don't use it everyday. I guess they need to work on the hyper part.\n",
      "This is my go to supplement for energy.  It gives me a good steady boost of energy that lasts for at least 5 to 6 hours without feeling over-stimulated.  If I take one pill in the morning, I only need one scoop of Hyper FX before my evening workout.  I really hope BSN continues to produce Hyper Shred.  I don't know what I would do without it, especially in the morning!\n",
      "I really like the energy that the Hyper Shred gives you, I didn't see much in terms of weight loss, but I really liked that this product didn't make me feel jittery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ok energy boost, one pill dose makes it easy\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid fat burner, provides energy and some appetite suppression. Does not upset my stomach or make me feel jittery. I have a higher tolerance to stims. I would recommend this, as I have seen results with this COUPLED with extreme diet and cardio.\n",
      "I would recommend this product. I have used my fair share of supplements, fat burners included. I did my research before choosing this product. I have been on this for a few weeks now and have already seen results. Mind you, I also train and eat right-nothing will replace that. This product definitely gives me smooth, clean energy-no jitters and no upset stomach. I have felt tweaked out before on stims and don't get into that at all-just looking for a nice boost and a little warmth to help cut that last little bit of fat. Personally, this product works great for me-would recommend for anyone to try at least, just remember to not take this or any stim with pre-work out. Too much caffeine! \n",
      "I love this product! So far it's the best fat burner I have tried (I've tried about 5 different brands). It gives me energy and focus without jitters (just remember to take it with food or a shake)!\n",
      "\n",
      "Really like hypershred.feel it gives me a good start on my day.energy is good ,helps with appetite.\n",
      "After i bought Shred Jym.. Can't believe i ever took this. It did nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using this product, I did notice that I was becoming more and more lean as time went on.  The reason it gets an 8 and not a 10 is that I did not feel like it provided any extra energy or focus.  \n",
      "Great product to use in the off season to keep regular and fat at a minimum.  Not giving it any more than a 7 because I did not feel it provided any energy or extra boost for training...did notice it kept me regular though.  Way better fat burning products out there, but this one is decent. \n",
      "I like this products over others, it has a blend of different ingredients thats give me the results I want without the extreme heart rates and sweats.\n",
      "Going through the second bottle, I take it in the morning and it helps me to be ready for a non starving day. Great product\n",
      "Good product as long as you 30 mins prior to meal\n",
      "\n",
      "Is a good produc \n",
      " It did nothing for me, it did not even give me any energy. Waste of money\n",
      "This is by far the best fat burner I've tried! I've used a lot of over the counter fat burners including Hydroxycut Elite; none worked like this one! If used properly and taken about half an hour before your meal you'll feel the tingles! \n",
      "This was my first day using the product and I loved it. It gave me the extra energy to go hard in the gym. I will be purchasing the product again\n",
      "First off, I am a big BSN fan. Their pre-workout products have been my favorite by far. That being said, I tried Hyper Shred about a year ago and didn't notice any benefit or even any effects. I decided to try it again last month and purchased two bottles. Again, I'm disappointed and don't notice any benefit at all. Not sure why because I notice others are happy with it. I won't be purchasing a third time. \n",
      "\n",
      "you have energy but I felt like my skin was on fire. I liked oxy elite better, I didn't care for this\n",
      "UPDATE 11/04/14- i am updating this review since i found this fat burner in my stash since i didn't use it last time around...\n",
      "i started using this later on in my prep and it has helped with energy levels for morning fasted cardio and throughout the morning. still has that heated skin effect, but overall i am happy with the result and feeling it has been giving over the past couple of weeks. as with all stims, less is more when starting out and increase based in individual sensitivities\n",
      "LOVE this product !! xoxo\n",
      "Great energy- good heat/thermogenic burn\n",
      "I can feel it working quickly- instead of \"why isn't this working?\"\n",
      "Helps me to sweat at the gym, lol\n",
      "Pushing it on a few friends/coworkers- to get them amped up and motivated. NO jittery side effects (and I LIVE on caffeine, so take it from me) Great focus, energy, burns fat- this lil pill is awesome !\n",
      "IF you are (thinking) about trying it- stop. Stop thinking and just try it. Grab the trial bottle if you are apprehensive. You will be back and get the 90day bottle, lol :) \n",
      "I received this for free when I bought their protein on BB.Com. I had looked at buying it before and I'm glad I didn't. All it really did was make me sweat more. It is correct in its advertisement that it fits the pre-workout window, because it does get your core burning; you can feel it right away making you sweat even before you begin your workout! I would not recommend this though as I did not feel like it gave me extra energy or focus. I still have half of the bottle left to go and I do not intend on using it anymore. I will keep it around as a last resort pill, maybe when it is re-introduced to my system I will feel the energy. My girlfriend also tried it and did not feel the energy. A lot of sweat though.\n",
      "If you're enlisting in the Army and going thru MEPS then take a serving of this before you go. Seriously. If you have trouble ******* in front of others you will have no issues doing do after taking that pill. Heck. You'll probably have enough to fill everyone else's cup up too. I have never hated a product so much in my life. Did nothing for me but make me **** like a race horse in the Kentucky Derby with a glue truck behind it.\n",
      "Makes you jittery and your heart race.  I wouldn't refer it to anyone \n",
      "So far, I am liking this product.  I can feel a slight boost in energy and focus.  Hopefully this will increase as I take it more.  \n",
      "BE CAREFUL when taking this product with pre-workout supplements!!!! \n",

      "It's my 2nd summer using this product. I can see results after about a week already. It also improves my mood. I strongly recommend this product. Iv'e tried cellucor and nutrex cutting products before and I was dissapointed. This one is defently the best among them \n",
      "\n",
      "Does not work for me.\n",
      "First time using product but when I started taking it my energy spiked. 8 also notice it helpes controlling my appetite, I recomend it for anyone need a boost and shred extra pounds. \n",
      "This is the only thermogenic I've tried, but it works pretty well. I'm halfway through my 2nd bottle in 6 months. I lost 10lbs with the first bottle, and have come down another 5lbs with this one. It suppressed my appetite really well the first few week, and has helped give me motivation to start eating a lot healthier. Usually makes me have to use the bathroom within an hour of taking it though.\n",

It could be that my body is fully used to caffeine since changing source from Amino Energy to this but I can't find anything to complain about.\n",
      "I've gotten very good results with this product.  \n",
      "I liked it to help burn a little bit of fat so it did what it was bought for. I think some people make the mistake of eating bad and expect this to overcome that problem, it won't do it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "fat loss is ok, you don't see much difference using this productâ¦energy level okâ¦\n",
      "Started taking this product with the goal of burning some fat, while still increasing muscle mass.  Hyper Shred not only helped decrease my bodyfat to 3% for my competition, it also provided that caffeine boost in the morning that really helped get my day started on the right foot.\n",
      "I've been on this for 3 weeks as of today.  I decided to use this product to trim just the last little bit of fat that I wanted to.  I had hit a bump in the road and couldn't lose anymore.  I was at about 172 and as of today I'm 165 and I can tell a significant difference in my abdominal area.  Take this with a proper diet and after 2 weeks you'll start seeing changes.  \n",
      "Does what it says it will do, the energy is clean and last. I didn't lose any weight but that's cause I can't give up peanut butter lol\n",
      "was good for energy but i felt it didnt take long before i had built up a tolerance.\n",
      "I'm giving this a 4 for the fact that the first couple weeks I felt my appetite noticeably curbed, I'm now almost towards the end of the bottle and I have yet to experience any weight loss or increased energy. Ended up selling the second bottle I purchased. \n",
      "Amazing product! it helped me shed a good 23 lbs, but obviously while eating clean and doing more cardio than usual. I would buy again any time!\n",
      "While I did notice some extra energy, I had a bad reaction to this stuff. The first dose (first day) was fine, just felt a little hot, but then the second day I took it, I felt like I was on fire. I looked in the mirror and my skin was red and splotchy. It didn't stop for about an hour. Just be cautious when you're trying this for the first time.\n",
      "felt energy and focus only on the first day i used it, would feel tired at gym most of times even after taking this. went thru a whole bottle of 90 caps, not what i expected \n",
      "Really helped me shred pounds along with a stirct diet plan.\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "I think I was expecting too much. I didn't notice any kick up.\n",
      "I have been using this (on and off as needed) three times now\n",
      "I love this product, I feel I have energy in the morning that I haven't before, there is a noticeable difference in my figure, highly recommend it\n",
      "However, there have been a few times I have had bad reactions depending on the time of day, what i have eaten and how long before I had taken the pill. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't do anything for me at all. Doesn't give me any extra energy at all nor have I found it to help me in weight loss. I take one in the morning (30mins before breakfast) and another two before my workout but I don't feel anything from it at all. If I am using it wrong or there's a better way to use it, someone please let me know on my bodyspace?\n",
      "This product definitely works. I take one in the morning and one before my workout which varies in time depending on the day. Makes you sweat like crazy during cardio and lifting. Only downside is if you don't workout on it, you might notice the caffeine makes you on edge, and can make your heart race at times. If you can get past that like I did you will notice results. Taking it with a good workout schedule is key. I lost 12  lbs in 2 months and leaned out like crazy. \n",
      "This does nothing to me except some niacin flushing in the first 2 weeks.\n",
      "I still feel hungry and i do not have more energy than usual.\n",
      "I take one right after waking up, another one 4 hours later and another one in the afternoon.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Pros: No negative effects.\n",
      "this product does work but it was not worth the side affects. it made me very short tempered and after i would take it my body would feel very unsettled and uncomfortable i tried just taking one a day and i still had the same side effects.\n",
      " PLEASE DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE - get some &quot;trial&quot; ones first.\n",
      "i noticed warm like other thermogenic product but nothing than headaches, and nausea.I'm disappointed\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely gives me a lot of energy and focus.  Only similar pill I've tried is cellucor and that wasn't nearly as good for me.  Will definitely order this again, lost about 20lb in ~60 days on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good for a mild buzz the first week. Tolerance develops quickly and then you don't even notice it. I've been good with my diet consistently for the last 6 months. added this 4 weeks ago with no noticeable difference. snake oil. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff makes me want to run all day for some reason. I love it.\n",
      "Gave me severe jitters when I took it. Sensation of nausea at times. Didn't really notice much with energy and focus while working out. Though I did feel my core temperature being overall quite warm, throat parched and average heart rate during workouts quite high.\n",

      "started taking 2 pills before I was ready and I broke out all over my body. since then I have been taking 1 at a time and the energy I get it is amazing. I've dropped 10 pounds in the last 2 and a half weeks. will keep using for a while!\n",

      "\n",
      "So far this product has been awesome. I'm using it as a coffee replacement, seeing how I was a pot-a-day drinker. I would find myself dehydrated by lunch time drinking so much coffee. Now that I'm taking HyperShred, I find myself able to drink more water, stay hydrated, and have much more focus throughout the workday. I do not have any other caffine based supplements to compare to, but so far this has worked excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I take this product every morning 30 to 60 mins before breakfast. It helps me wake up without any negative side affects. I only take 1 pill and it seems to give me all the energy I need  through out the day.\n",
      "AMAZING PRODUCT! I don't even need a pre-workout anymore. This stuff keeps me going all day. I wrestle in college, and i have the best practices ever taking this. It doesn't make me jittery like Hydroxycut, but instead just gives me a clean rush of energy that lasts a long time. I highly recommend it.\n",
      " No\n",
      "Solid product, redefines clean energy (at least for me, but I'm somewhat stim tolerant). \n",
      "\n",
      "This thing is helping me lose weight (mostly fat) then again most thermos do that. For me it deserves a 10 for doing so providing awesome clean energy and for not being that expensive.\n",
      "this is the  best . i used.  much betther tham oxyelite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loving this product and ive been on it for a couple of weeks now, works wonderfully and i never feel a crash later, probably one of the best purchases i ever made!keeps me focused and doesnt make me jittery and a must have for anyone cutting down!!\n",
      "My favorite fat loss/energy supplement! Feels like ephedrine as there's no crash but it's healthy - geranium free! Awesome stuff!\n",
      "\n",
      "Worst fat burner on the market! I have been taking them for three days and my right arm went numb, lost sleep, and  I am sweating all day. Stay away from this product. Your safer taking Incinerator by Bodybuilding.com\n",
      " any way it is very recommended product for those who want to lose wight\n",
      "This supplement gave me hella energy with no crash cause i took it with food in my stomach and about an hour later i felt the energy kick in and i can tell its a strong thremogenic cause i started sweating just sitting there but it wasnt like rain sweat just enough to notice and it suppressed my appetite to where i wouldnt feel like i need to eat all day\n",
      "I decided to try after reading awesome comments here but personally didn't work for me. Too hard on stomach and body. Probably something to do with niacin Prefer ergo shred over this.\n",
      "This gives me a lot of  energy in the morning for my morning cardio. So it is definitely a top supplement for me  i have noticed it helps me lose the excess fat that i have been working to lose\n",
      "I'm about done with my first bottle of the stuff, taking one in the morning before my meal, typically two scoops of gold standard and a small box if special k and then two caps half hour before lunch, I've lost a significant amount of body fat my gut taped in at 43 inches and right now id between 40 and 41 depending on the time of day I tape myself, I have hit 39 since starting but I cheated a little and pulled the tape super tight, the first few days had my mind racing at night if I took the second dose too late but I have been sleeping well taking it about 10am (I take the first at 5am for those keeping score) great product one of the best I've used.\n",
      "I have used this product for about a month now and have noticed some great results. When I take this product, I feel focused and can feel the thermogenics start to work. When I was working out regularly, I noticed an increase in weight loss. Since having a baby, I haven't been to the gym as much but by still take Hyper Shred and eating a good diet, I have been able to maintain my weight and loss a pound or two. I just ordered another bottle and can't wait to keep shredding pounds. \n",
      "Gave this a try after read review and it really give u good energy threw out the day w/o a crash and u real feel thermogenic affect\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an awesome product. At first I did not think that a thermogenic would be something I would even consider taking, but i said hey why not give it a shot! And boy was I happy. I took one pill in the morning and felt the shakes, and I am a big guy, it takes a lot to make an effect on me. My wife was jumping off the walls because of the energy she got and we both felt a small sweat, burning some more extra callories. Supplaments arent mandatory, but boy they sure help!!\n",
      "Great thermo! I am not very sensitive to caffeine, but I do feel its affects. Gives me focus, controllable energy, and raises my temp a bit, but all that is expected. IMPORTANT: you need to eat food in the 30-45 minute window after taking this. Only then, did I get jitters and headaches, etc. So if you follow the directions, it is a great product.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A big boost of energy throughout the whole work out and after!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to BSN for letting me try hyper shred. Overall very very pleased, I am on a cut with hyper shred and it works get for not letting me crave food. The energy I get with it is awesome, almost as a preworkout. I dont notice a major fat loss but the workouts I put in. I would recommend this product almost as a pre workout for people. I was worried about the stims in it, no problem, no jitter's at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just had one dose of it today and man. My workout was insane. Great energy and focus. Can't wait to continue this and keep it in my stack. Awesome product.\n",
      "I was already a fan of BSN protein powders because of the quality and the fact that their flavors are on point. A couple of weeks after I had a baby I started using the IsoBurn and I am now 3.5 months post partum and 5 pounds from my pre-pregnancy weight. Of course, it wasn't this product alone, but it has been a good boost of energy and hunger satisfaction to keep me going. If you get the right water to powder ratio it's delicious and smooth. It's also good blended with almond milk and a banana. You can drink it anytime of the day whether it's a quick and easy meal replacement or pre/post workout drink. Don't think that you can simply use this daily and weight will fall off, but it's an excellent supplement to a healthy, balanced diet and workout routine. \n",
      "This is a light, smooth, protein shake, with great flavor.  It is extremely delicious!  I can drink it morning or night.   \n",
      "I love this protein powder. I have the chocolate flavor as a stand alone shake every morning at work. On the weekends I mix the vanilla with fruit and yogurt for awesome smoothies.\n",
      "I mix vanilla with water, ice, and a banana and/or mixed fruit using the NutriBullet. The taste is incredible. I usually am not a big fan of vanilla flavors - Phase 8 being the only other vanilla that doesn't have a watered down taste - but this one is the real deal. I am indifferent to Syntha-6 but Iso is excellent.\n",
      "This one was simply surprising! I bought it more for weekend trips when I don't have good food available and need that protein in me to stay full and sustained. It is surprisingly filling, tastes awesome and is convenient to carry around in the little sized jar.\n",
      "This protein powder taste delicious! Very satisfying when you need some protein on the go. Plus it has fat burners which is a plus. Helped me lose 7 lbs so far. Can't wait to try the other flavors!\n",
      "I love this Protein. I used it and it helped me drop 30 lbs of fat along with working out. Flavor tastes great once you get the mix rate correct using water. If you use milk then you'll swear it was a milkshake.\n",
      "This stuff is great. My main protein was MusclePharm Combat powder which is the best tasting on the market in my opinion. This is close in taste and has the lower calories along with the fat burning components. I am very caffeine sensitive so having no caffeine is a huge plus. I'm liking the syntha 6 edge also!\n",
      "Maybe I got a bad batch, but the Vanilla is gross.\n",
      "Love it...mixes well with any juice or milk and tastes excellent for a low carb/low fat protein. Strawberry is very good also. I just wish it were cheaper and sold in a bigger size. Regardless, I haven't had any other protein since buying this product.\n",
      "I have been using Vanilla Ice Cream and I think its a great flavor.  Ordered two containers of the Chocolate Milkshake thinking it would be great.  Couldn't stand the taste of it. very chalky bad after taste. Wish I only bought one container. Only reason I switched flavors was because the vanilla was sold out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff is really very good and provides a lot of punch to help shred the fat and feed the muscles.  My only problem with the product is how much you get for the price point, and the overkill container.  Super effective, but the container is only half full.\n",
      "My favorite protein flavor is Peanut Butter Cookie but that wasn't available in Isoburn when I purchased the product. I was a little leary but tried it after a workout as soon as I got it and I was shocked. I only had water to put it in but it tasted wonderful! I have never had such good protein. BSN knows how to get it done. I love the results I'm gettin too!\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is a great product for losing weight.  I have developed lean muscle mass while losing about 12 pounds of fat within the past 2 months.  My body fat% has gone from 25 to 18 during this time and I am continuing to see great results. \n",
      "I actually really like this product. A lot of other protein powers have a gritty or powdery texture when you mix, and some leave lumps of powder no matter how much you try to mix it without a blender. Not Isoburn. Every time, it mixes very well, with a smooth texture and no lumps. The strawberry taste pretty good as well, with the flavor and texture reminding me of strawberry Yoo-hoo. I don't know about the fat burning promises but otherwise I'd buy this again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had my Vanilla Isoburn for almost two weeks now. I love the flavor, 10/10 all day. I have maintained a constant diet and exercise routine sine november 1st, and have noticed a drop in weight with the addition of isoburn. My biggest complaint is that the container is OVER twice the size it needs to be, and I am a few days from running out of isoburn to use. It literally showed up early last week. I don't mind the price, but I would GLADLY pay more for enough protein to filled the designated container. It is really ridiculous. \n",
      "Favorite protein by far! Never thought i would like vanilla protein but this one takes just like a milkshake. I have gained a couple of pounds of muscle in the last 3 weeks since i started using a stack from BSN and i absolutely love it. No complaints from me. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very good product. My only complaint is about the packaging. The plastic container is over TWICE the size it needs to be to contain the product. The label is accurate in terms of net weight, and I realize some settling occurs during packing and shipping, but NOT THAT MUCH. The container could be half the size, and still contain the same amount of product. This would save money in production, storage and shipping, and possibly make the product less expensive for the consumer. Plus it would result in less plastic waste. \n",
      "It seems to me like any other protein, with a little added boost of energy for a bit after taking it. I've tried all 3 flavors, I mix my protein with water only, so this is based on the protein alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate -  Don't waste your money. It was truly awful. As someone else described, it is more like baking cocoa. I found that adding a packet of Stevia made it palatable, but that's a big investment and it still was not enjoyable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vanilla - Really good! A much welcomed change from the chocolate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strawberry - The best by far. It's not a real strong fruit flavor so it doesn't taste overly sweet and no aftertaste. Highly recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've used this flavor and brand multiple times. Tastes great and best with some unsweetened almond milk. I only stock this because the girl i workout with likes it. On the expensive side. I recommend this product for begginers to weight lifting, women for all around active, and 50/50's looking for a lean look. I don't recommend this to hard gainers. This product is simple, smells great, and it works for all around active people. I noticed its not as thick as most powders, doesn't clump up, & noticablally not as thick as other Shakes when drinking, which  is a good thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "6.5 out of 10 for price\n",
      "9.5 out of 10 for taste\n",

      "10 out of 10 for quality\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm super picky about protein powder. They need to taste incredible, be thick enough in plain water to be somewhat filling and they need to mix easily in water. Sythna-6 sets the bar for all three of those must haves so I was excited to try isoburn! I've never even found a vanilla protein I liked until syntha-6 and I love it so much I took a chance on the vanilla syntha. AMAAAAZING. Almost identical to the vanilla syntha! Mixes perfectly in seconds, it's creamy and rich and tastes sooooo good. BSN nailed again with this product! It's a 10 from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste good!! Didn't really like the overall at all BSN comes very hard with  there product line. Thinking i well try again i know sometimes bottle go bad or not mix right. \n",
      "I really love the taste. I'm still trying to lose fat so I appreciate the low calories. It does clump if I don't use the blender but that isn't a problem for me anymore. I do feel full after drinking my shake. It's helped me a great deal in not over eating.\n",
      "I cannot explain just how much I LOVE this product! I have a very strict diet, never deviating from it and sometimes I crave something delicious and I have this huge need to cheat on my diet BUT I never do. Until I got this product. I work my butt off with an intense workout session every single morning and I reward myself with this DELICIOUS \"cheat meal\". Literally tastes like vanilla ice cream! And it blends so well. Other protein powders I've tried are chalky and chunky but this blends amazing with no chunks. I'm looking to buy every flavor on my next paycheck. LOVE LOVE LOVE! \n",
      "\n",
      "Waooo nice flavor and teas real good 100% satisfaction is my new item for protein \n",
      "Great taste and mixes incredibly well.\n",
      "Not worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to try a different protein powder from BSN. ISO burn looked pretty good so I tried it. BSN has done it again. Iso burn mixes very well, has a great taste, and because I took it in the morning, it gave me the energy I needed to get through my workouts. This is a great weight loss protein powder. A must for anyone looking to loss weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a doubt one of my fav protein powders, easy to mix with a shaker or in a blender. Vanilla ice cream is absolutely delicious for banana and peanut butter shakes! certainly a post workout reward I look forward to. It has also helped to define leaner muscles & definition.\n",
      "The consensus seems to be that fruit-flavored protein tastes chalky and weird...which may be the case: if you aren't mixing it with the right stuff! I bought the strawberry and mix it with slightly sweetened, organic almond milk (lactose intolerant) and it tastes AMAZING. Just like a strawberry shake. That being said, it also makes me feel totally rejuvenated when taken immediately after a workout\n",
      "Great taste, mixes well and isn't chalky. It's a small scoop per serving. I didn't necessarily notice the \"burn\" effect of it, but I suppose one never would. Good product for good value. I'll buy it again\n",
      "It worked great. I've notice muscle mass and fat loss. Not as much as I wanted but it did work. So I'm happy. \n",
      "This is definitely my favorite protein powder!! It works & taste amazing! Yet another fabulous BSN product! \n",
      "It taste great! It does make me gassy though. Not sure if it has aided in weight-loss because I try not to drink protein drinks often, as I would rather eat whole food. Overall, I think its great. \n",
      "\n",
      "This takes just like vanilla icecream and is so good on it's own or blended with frozen fruit to make thick shake!!! My favorite powder by far\n",
      "Taste is delicious and satisfying. I usually mix it with Green Vibrance, a little frozen fruit , water and sweetener any time of the day.\n",
      "I've been bouncing around proteins for a while trying to find one that tastes delicious without making me feel bloated.  This one is perfect and it has the added thermogenic which is a plus when trying to lean out leading up to a competition.  \n",
      "I really wish I had paid more attention to the ingredients.  This is all junk. Sunflower oil and corn syrup solids...and seriously,  green coffee extract is useless and a scam. The first ingredients of the \"proprietary blend\" are Guar Gum and Locust Bean Gum? BSN should be embarrassed.  This product is pure crap.\n",
      "I like this product. I prefer the strawberry. It taste really good. It mixes really well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tried it and loved it , I never sweat so much , intensity of fat burning increased and I could feel it working and my personal stats show, ISOBURN  stacked with other BSN supplements SYNTHA-6, N.O.-XPLODE and results are awesome and I'm loving it. Definitely recommend\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the flavor and texture of this protein. I like the mixture of ingredients, and it works on par with other proteins i've used for recovery. It's my favorite out of all the one's i've tried.\n",
      "Wasn't thrilled about the flavor, tasted more like vomit than maltshake\n",
      "I just finished my second tub of this stuff both were the vanilla flavor. This is the greatest protein period for summer weight lifting. I actually lost 8 to 10 pounds by taking this 2 to 3 times a day just like any other protein. But not only did I loose weight I also gained strength really fast I easily added 5 to 10 pounds to a lot of my lifts while taking this stuff. Greatest summer protein ever if you have any doubt just try it and get ready to fall in love.\n",
      "The taste is great but I have never been so sore. I usually only take amino acids and protein. Figured a fat burning protein would be great but without glutamine added into the protein I was extremely sore. This caused me to have to buy glutamine separate which means more money on supplements. I switched back to my original protein because it has the glutamine already for a great price. \n",
      "First off taste, I have had a lot of different protein powders. And I can say this is the BEST tasting ever! I mix with just water and ice in a water bottle. non gritty, and taste sooooo good. I am not 100% sure it the fat burner does anything, but since I started this product, I have def lost some body fat, but also working out more intense. I am a female, started lifting to help burn fat. Only complaint is the price. Its only 20 servings.\n",
      "Since this is a new product I was a bit Skeptical, but after using it for about a month I can say that if you're trying to lose weight this is the protein for you.  Whether you as a pre-workout shake or a post-workout shake it works.  I personally take it as a post work out shake and I feel the burn even after I get home.  The Flavor is amazing and it dissolves really good.  I highly recommend it. \n",
      "This is my first time using BSN protein, I used it with N.O. explode and Amino X. The  product is doing what company claims but, I don't think its any  better than other whey isolates. \n",
      "I love BSN products and this item did not disappoint. The flavor was great but a little different than Sythna-6. It mixes well and very thin texture. I can feel the fat burner the first time I took it. I would recommend this product but the only downside is that it is overprice for only twenty something servings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purchased as part of product promotion and incorporated it into my regular supplement schedule.  It is a great protein, mixes well and tastes amazing.  If I had to choose between this and the regular vanilla protein by BSN I would go with the latter.  Might try it again in the future. \n",
      "I definitely saw a major improvement in the past month using this.  I also used other fat burning products, but this supplements everything so well. I definitely recommend it!\n",
      "I love the Isoburn Vanilla.  As well, as making an excellent shake alone, or with added ingredients; I also make it as ice cream.  It's delicious and I highly recommend it! \n",
      "Great product, Strawberry Milkshake taste really good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that is a little bit overpriced.\n",
      "I did not notice any real change in body composition while taking this product. Taste is ok. I think you're better off with either regular Syntha-6 or Syntha-6 Isolate. This is probably a product you have to take more than one tub of.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went through 2 tubs, strwberry tasted really good, not like syntha 6 but still looked forward to my shakes. At 1 gram for the \"fat burning complex\", probably underdosed but I still lost about 2lbs. I was using 1 1/2 scoops per serving after my workouts. Really enjoyed the product,  results would be steady after prolonged use, but at over $30 for a 1.3lb tub...20 servings.. very overpriced and personally feel that its not worth the money. Sticking with a regular whey protein for the time being\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is incredible.  Since they increased the price of recovery shakes at my local gym, this powder has enabled me to make my own shakes at home for a fraction of what I was spending.  I can't say enough good things about it.\n",
      "Definitely not the best tasting protein/supp but the results are definitely worth it. I love Syntha-6 and wanted to try this product to help burn fat. If you can get over the taste you will love the results. I have been using this for about a week with my regular diet and exercise regiment and I can tell the difference in fat/weight loss.\n",
      "Flavor is terrible, vascularity wise it was decent I give it a 6, energy I give it a 3, focus a 4. It was always hit or miss with this sometimes I'd feel great sometimes I hated it. It sat in my stomich ever time I took it\n",
      "This is the worst tasting preworkout that I ever took. I actually have to mix it with my crystal light so I am able to drink it. I do not feel the energy that I had with my #Shatter SX7. I would not recommend that you buy this product.\n",
      "I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and I've seen drastic amounts of change in my vascularity. within the first week alone I began to notice how much more my veins bulged just doing basic every day activities, not even including the time I was actually taking the product in the gym. I mix one scoop with 2 scoops of ON Amino Energy and have noticed both an increased pump in my workouts as well as an increase in the longevity of my workouts. It's helped me start to see more gains and cutting of fat, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great pre workout. The flavor has an interesting botanical type taste, but once you get used to it, it's really not bad at all.\n",
      "This is my new favorite pre-workout!  I've been using it for the past month and love the effects.  I feel energized, but not shaky.  Focused but not wired.  100% motivation!\n",
      "\n",
      "#GPNemployee\n",
      "I felt the same effects as the regular N.O. Xplode but I thought the taste was awful. Got Fruit punch and Tropical. I Already re order some regular N.O. Xplode cause I love it but would not suggest buying this product cause you will be stuck with something you don't like.\n",
      "Tastes great but does not give me any boost at all. Even after only using it five times, I increased to two scoops and it still gave me no energy at all to work out.  Waste of money not a good product. \n",
      "not a whole lot of good to say about this product. first i saw basically no increase in energy level. i wake and go to the gym around 5 so i need something that's going to give me some energy, i don't need to be bouncing off the walls but this gave be virtually nothing. the taste was ok not great but not terrible, i do usually mix my pw with about 16-20 oz of water but thats because i dont care for how sweet 99% of pw are. The Main Reason i rated this product so low was because of the CRASH. about 1-2 hrs after my workout i would crash hard, headaches and just being tired were my main problems. ive been going back in forth between pre-jym and c4 for about the past yr and thought i would give this a try since i take syntha6 protein but that was a mistake. i have tried other preworkouts that i didnt like but i still could make myself use the whole bottle but not this stuff its going in the garbage with more than half a bottle left.   \n",
      "One of the best pre workouts in the market. I was a huge fan of the original N.O.-xplode. I would mix it with 1 pill of nitrix to give me a extra pump. With this New edge serious, I dont need to mix with anything. Just one scoop is enough to get me the best workout. I would recommend it to anyone who wants the max out at the gym. I give it 9.99/10 Only cause i want more flavors. I am a participant in the BSN Army july/August sweepstakes. I certify I have used this product\n",
      "Have tried a bunch of these energy products.   I normally train early in the morning and need a hard kick to keep my focus on point.   My brother in law was all over this product and I decided to give it a shot.   It definitely did not disappoint!  Had exactly what I was looking for, sustained energy and focus with a pump!  I’m not a huge flavor guy, fruit punch (always easy) was better than I expected!  I will definitely buy again.   \n",
      "Wow, I have used N.O.-XPLODE since the glory days so I was pretty excited to see a brand new product fromt he brand.  With that said, I was a little skeptical but saw this and had to try.  I ordered the Troipcal Burst and Green Apple and WOW I am a believer!  This gave me intense super energy and tunnel vision focus.  I needed to destroy my workout and this product helps me do that.  I have found my new preworkout and won't be changing anytime soon.  Awesome!\n",
      "I was a bit skeptical of this product at first but decided to try it based on feedback from friends and glad I did.  Wow this pre is for real.  Love the intense focus and energy.  The pumps are for real too which you don't normally get with the these types of energy products.  I pretty much love all the flavors but tropical burst is my favorite.  Best pre workout on the market right now hands down.  \n",
      "Tried a sample of this stuff and logged right on to order. New NO Xplode XE gave me super power energy and focus in the gym after a long day of work. Taste's awesome. Tried a sample of Fruit Punch and that's going to be my next purchase!!\n",
      "Have tried a lot of Pre-Workouts and N.O.-Xplode XE Edge Tropical Burst is by far the best! Felt great, did not crash, and got those extra reps i was looking for after a long day of work!   Very Fast Shipping! Great Tasting!\n",
      "The flavor takes some time to get use to but this product definitely works. I can feel the preworkout as it starts to kick in and it without a doubt gives me the energy to push through even the toughest of workouts!! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to burn extra calories and boost energy when working out.\n",
      "Well I overlooked on the differences between this and the regular N.O xplode I have taken in the past. Thought this was a higher doses version but it's a bit of a different product. Mixing the powder is hit or miss, sometimes you can mix it easy with a spoon other times it clunks up and tastes horrible. Be ready to feel the focus and most importantly the bubble guts within 5-7 minutes of ingestion, be near a toilet, again this is hit or miss as some days it's fine and others you have to use the toilet before training. Again you start to feel the product working within five minutes and I can feel focused in the gym up to say one and a half hours after ingestion. The product is missing a few pump and N.O. ingredients and this is where I should have looked at the ingredients list better, my fault, but yeah going with one of the trainer created products is your better bet. Not only is dosage higher but you get scientifically proven ingredients and not a bunch of fillers. Sadly I can't recommend this product to my friend's. Used to be a huge N.O. Xplode fan, best recipe for me was the version in 2008-2009 but since I don't feel it measures up to it and I've taken sometimes a year from preworkouts. I'll finish these bottles off and look into something else.\n",
      "This product was weak. I'm talking really weak. I used to take the original formula when it first came out when I was in high school, back when no xplode would actually give a good amount of focus and energy. It seems every time they create a new formula it's worse and worse. I wish I could get my hands of the no explode from 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the worst tasting pres out there..also did not feel much from it.. i have a pretty srrong tolerance to pre but this was almost useless. I wouldt recommend.\n",
      "Saw that there was a 25% off coupon so decided to give this a try. I tend to go to the gym early inthe morning so I need something that'll wake me up and give me that push from the start. Edge gave me exactly that. About ten minutes after takin it I could feel it. I did notice a significant difference in strength as I was able to go through about one extra rep per set. I didn't feel as much of a pump from it as others have said but it definitely works for giving you the extra energy you might need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Directions say stir and not shake. Do follow that. For some reason when you shake it it does create some pressure inside the bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had he tropical burst flavor. Tastes pretty **** good initially but leaves a pretty bitter after taste. If you can get over the bitterness the taste is still really good.\n",
      "I've probably tried 15 different PWO's and this is the best pre i've ever used.  It doesn't taste very well, but the amount of focus, pump, and energy i had deffinately made up for it. Not many pre-workouts out there that have that ingredient list for that price. Deffinately recommend.\n",
      "It provides more focus and power than any other pre workout that I have used. The taste is very good, but gold standard pre workout surpasses it in taste only because it is not as bitter. Other pre workouts make you feel better during your workout and this does the same thing but better. There is noticeable tingling/itchyness in the hands because of the beta alanine but goes away after about 5 minutes. In conclusion, It is not different from any pre workout in what it does, but it does do its job better. Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "THIS COOKIE IS OFF THE CHAIN GOOD.  I was expecting a cookie that taste like cardboard.  But instead I was surprised!!!!  When I bit into the cookie, my brain was like...\"Is this a Chik Fi La cookie???\"  It was delicious and moist, I would definite be buying more of these.\n",
      "Theses cookies are amazing to have for a snack if you want something sweet. The macros are pretty good as well. I am going to buy more to have on hand! \n",
      "Good taste. \n",
      "Only flavor tried so far but my golly this is an excellent product. Will try the rest but this one is so good, don't really need to! The protein is what sold it to me, the taste will have me continuing to order!\n",
      "Sooooooo delicious. Its soft and moist, just like a chewy chips ahoy cookies, but with PROTEINNNNN!\n",
      "Oh my god. This cookie (only talking about the choco chip pb flavor) is OUT OF THIS WORLD. It's so good. The chocolate was gooey and I think I went to heaven. \n",
      "\n",
      "Only thing I don't like is how high the macros are... 2 servings are in one cookie, so half of the cookie is already high in cal/carbs. Please come up with a new formula BuffBake!\n",
      "\n",
      "taste great, good ingredients will be buying more\n",
      "I ordered one of each flavor just to find out if they were any good before ordering a box, and let me just say that I will be ordering a box on my next order!  Thus far I've only had the Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter and the Frosted Oatmeal Raisin.... and they were both yummy!!!  These are thick, big cookies, and they've very moist and soft.  They're not at all hard, dry and crumbly.... so if you like a hard, crunchy cookie, these may not be for you.  But if you like 'em moist and soft, you're in for a treat.  The taste is so good that my wife wants me to order some for her the next time I place an order.\n",
      "Weights are weights.  These scale out at or very close to marked poundages. They are rough around the edges and require a touch of filing in order to slide on and off the bar smoothly.  The bar has little to no knurling, but with a touch of tape it's more than adequate.  Over all it's a great buy for the money.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This Protein has to be the worst protein I've ever had. It taste horrible and I will never buy this brand again. I went on a limb and bought the big daddy and it is absolutely horrible. I wouldn't even give it to someone.\n",
      "To begin I'm a huge fan of Layne Norton. However, I won't be buying this protein again.  I bought all three flavors.  The salted caramel is good, but it is un-godly sweet.  The vanilla is also sweet and the chocolate is absolutely terrible.  I'll be throwing the chocolate away.  This protein does mix very easily though.  \n",
      "Easily one of my favorite protein powder flavors I've ever had. Great mixability and it makes my morning coffee one of my favorite parts of the day :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I can only speak for the vanilla ice cream flavor. It tastes amazing. It isn't the best tasting I've ever had. But pretty close. What I really like about it is that it mixes easily and has 3G leucine per scoop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:\n",
      "Flavor 9/10\n",
      "Everything else about it 10/10\n",
      "Big Layne fan, I use prep and recover too. Product has great profile but the taste isn't great. Not the worst I've used but definitely not my fav. Saying that I'd likely buy again.\n",
      "A huge fan of Layne Norton so I was curious on this new product. I am still a fan but I find the same salted caramel as overly sweet, and it doesn't blend as well as my usual wpi. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's still a really decent product and Norton's reputation helps me maintain some faith in this wpi.\n",
      "I love the Carbon line and Layne Norton. I am very harsh on proteins since there are just so many on the market, but this product lives up to the Carbon name. I use isolates after workouts, just to ensure the protein breaks down as quickly as possible, plus it offers the best taste (in my opinion). \n",
      "Flavors: All three rate very high, mixing well with water and milk. Not too sweet, but offering an amazing flavor profile and really tasting like they should. \n",
      "Effect: This is hard to judge since you can't \"feel\" protein working, but since using this product I have noticed quite a bit added recovery much like I had with Re-Kaged. \n",
      "Price: Price is roughly $1 a serving, so on par with other high quality of isolates, would be better deal for $29.99 for the 2 Lbs. and $59.99 for the 4 Lbs. I still feel that the price is still well worth the quality of the product and I will not use another product besides this or Re-Kaged. \n",
      "Quality: Carbon is known for quality and formulation, which Build is no different. High quality whey isolate, which mixes really easily and goes down very quickly (partly from taste). \n",
      "Overall: I give this product  10/10 since it backs up all the claims on the label. You truly get what you pay for, much like Prep and Recover as well. Carbon is one of the best supplement lines that offer 100% transparency with no bull or borrowed science.\n",
      "Exceptional taste, blends well, and created by the most honest and standup fitness professional in the industry.\n",
      "I ordered the chocolate milkshake and salted caramel and this is by far the best tasting whey isolate on the market.  Completely dissolves and doesn't leave a disgusting aftertaste.  Great product for meeting daily protein requirements.  No gimmicks, just real science.\n",
      "This is the best tasting isolate. It mixes in coffee terrifically, and with almond milk too. There is no bad after taste, and the flavor is amazing. It takes #1 in my book, and I love that as amazing as it is, it's also affordable. Definitely my go to protein, same with carbon aminos!\n",
      "I have trusted Layne in the past as a competitor and when I saw he released a protein powder I had to try it.  The salted caramel flavor is phenomenal.   \n",
      "Hits the flavor right on the money! With the added thickener blend it's perfect for making shakes, and smoothies. It mixes well with just water and put it with some chocolate milk and you have one anabolic recipe for gains!\n",
      "I've tried so many isolates over the years and this is by FAR the best tasting product on the market. I write high protein recipes and it's important for me to use protein with the best taste for the macros... BUILD has it all! It delivers the best flavor, with almost 0 carbs and fat! Can't get any better than that! All of the flavors are BOMB -- great for protein pancakes, waffles, doughnuts, mug cakes, ice cream... the possibilities are endless! 10/10 :)\n",
      "I give this 8 stars because the flavor is good and the texture is good. with that said, I do find it to be a little gritty and it does foam up... I bought it because I like variety, and unfortunately, as long as PRO JYM is still around, I have yet to find a protein powder that can match the taste, texture, and quality of JYM, this included. It is good, just doesn't stand up to PRO JYM. \n",
      "I love both carbon prep flavors but fruit punch is my favorite. Carbon prep is my favorite pre workout because it is a non-stimulant, so no weird tingles from taking it. It helps you stay focused and gives you an amazing pump, which result in a better workout.\n",
      "Bought this product because I wanted to try different flavors.  After watching videos and reading up on Layne Norton, I thought this product would work for me.  It did not work.  PROS:  Does not have any caffeine, but contains other products which are supposed to be for mind focus and alertness...after reading up on those products, NOTHING has been proven...only speculation it works in that manner.  So, the PRO would be that you can use this before bed time and actually sleep if you are sensitive to stimulants.  CONS: Waaaay too sweet, seriously, one scoop is way to strong in the sweet department.  I ended up adding two liters per scoop.  I gave it a 7 because I got the pump and vascularity, but nothing in the \"focus\" department...nothing.\n",
      "Another great tasting pre workout without stimulants!  I love I can take it when I lift at night and not be up all night!\n",
      "Love this stuff.  Been using it for awhile and the definitely feel a difference.  I'm more focused in my workouts, can go longer, have great pumps and no longer need any type of stimulants.  Carbon products are definitely Top Tier and 5 Star Quality.\n",
      "The industry is flooded with just over hyped trash and super caffeinated BS. This is exactly why I recommend carbon. The dosages of every ingredient in it is backed by studies and scientific reasoning. Some may argue that it being caffeine free is a down fall but think about it, would you rather be able to control the amount of caffeine you take or be forced to down like 400mg just to get the proper amount of other ingredients (which IMO actually matter). The fruit punch flavor is great but not amazing. I use a little more water so I can sip and get my mind right before the gym but if you want a stronger taste I suggest following the instructions of 8-12oz. if you haven't tried this product it's definitely worth looking into.\n",
      "You cannot deny the science behind this. If you really want something that works and not just make you temporarily hyper with caffeine, you found it.\n",
      "This is a high quality, properly dosed product. I love that I have the option with this to skip the caffeine. Perfect for late night workouts or before a session of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I feel the increased focus as well as a decent \"pump\". This gives me the edge to get through a workout but still be able to go home and go straight to sleep without waiting for caffeine to wear off. I have read a lot of Dr. Norton's research and I know he has done a lot of great work in crafting this product to help achieve maximal results based on the scientific research behind it. Will definitely be buying again!\n",
      "Love this pre-work out! I have stayed away from pre-work outs supps for a long time after battling issues with adrenal fatigue, then I finally discovered this product, no stimulants yet I still feel focused and am getting more out of my workouts. I only take half a scoop as I'm only 5'2 and still get heaps out of it!  Hands down 10/10!! \n",
      "Didn't really notice any effect. Tastes bad. Not a fan. \n",
      "Tastes wonderful. Gave me CRAZY focus. Really like this product. Great pre workout. \n",
      "Love that I don't feel cracked out or itchy! The flavor is AMAZING but very strong. Tastes just like fruit punch juice.\n",
      "I really love the mental focus that Prep provides - I got side tracked doing 20 minutes or work the other day and was almost late meeting my lifting partner at the gym. \n",
      "\n",
      "Had some really great lifts since i added this into the routine. Will continue to use it over the next 6 weeks leading up to my meet. Best focus and drive i've ever had out of a pre workout. \n",
      "I started taking this because I was getting tired of the crash from stimulant preworkouts and haven't looked back since.  I usually carry around this and PreJym because I don't know when I'll be working out.  The focus I get for with Carbon Prep is unparalleled and I've even used it before exams.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using this product for my contest prep .. i'm a father of 3 and work a full time job so sometimes i'm not sure what time i'll get to the gym but I cant carry around a non stim and stim pre-workout so I use this in conjuction with a thermogenic when i'm working out mid day and without if I have to hit the gym in the evening. the taste is strong but good and it has to be like that to cover up the taste of the ingredients. This product is comparable to jym pre workout just without the caffeine . I get a good pump and no itchy balls.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the Cran-Grape flavor. Different the standard flavor offerings most companies offer (i.e. the obligatory fruit punch and blue raz flavors) \n",
      "\n",
      "For results using this product solo, I get pretty good endurance in my workouts but am only lifting a little bit heavier. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then I mixed it with 2 scoops of RSP's Amino Lean and had some of the best workouts I've had in months. I think maybe the Carbon needs just a small dose of stims... nothing crazy like 200g caffeine instead of the huge doses (300g+) in a lot of other pre-workouts.\n",
      "Disappointed with this Pre-workout. It had such awesome reviews but I feel I wasted my money. Personally the flavor is too strong. Normally that's not a complaint as you want it to taste good but it's intense. I need a lot of water to tone this down and I don't like a full stomach of liquid before a workout. It's like pouring strong pixie sticks into your mouth. The flavor is good but the intensity from just one scoop is overkill. Second, I feel zero pump while working out(non stimulant Pre).I don't need anything crazy but expected something. It defeats the purpose of a pre workout for me. I won't buy this one again. It gets a 5 for actual flavor. \n",
      "All the great benefits of a pre workout, without the caffeine! I'll be buying this pre for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "This preworkout is really all the above good in many ways. I experience a really good pump and energy level during my workout using this product. My focus goes into a smooth feeling zone that lasts throughout my workout. I can feel my body temperature start to increase which allows me to work up a nice sweat. The taste and mix ability is good. I've chosen to switch over to stimulant free preworkouts and this will be my go to product for sure.. I've tried PMP stim free also and must say that the pump is awesome but overall it doesn't compare to this product in my opinion.  \n",
      "This is my first ever pre workout drink. I buy this because first, I like the formula that it contains no stimulant because I train at night. Second, the ingredient of this supplement is one the best in the market. Other brands of pre workout have only 2-4 grams max Citrulline Malate, this thing has 6 grams. I don't care the price, but you have to give me what I pay, although it is a bit pricy, it is definitely worth it. As for how it works, I think it really gives me more energy and my strength really increase a lot. But I don't like the taste, it is kinda sour.  \n",
      "Pretty amazing stuff! Great for night lifters because it's not a stimulant! Really enjoy it!\n",
      "Really loved this product. This is the first preworkout I've tried that actually allowed me to have a great energized workout and still get a good night's sleep afterwards. My workouts are later in the evening, so this is critical for me. I have not tried the fruit punch flavor yet, but the cranberry grape was not entirely enjoyable. I very much look forward to more flavors of the Carbon products. Love them!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product. I used to hate the jitters and post-workout crashes from high-stim preworkouts. I usually just drink a cup of coffee with this supp and have been having some of the best workouts of my life. The only downside: extremely expensive! Also, the frequency that the product must be re-ordered is high because there are only 20 servings per container.  \n",
      "Loved this product despite being a caffeine junky! I used this to cycle off of stim-containing pre-workouts. I started with a half scoop of Carbon and half scoop of stim-containing pre-workout for a week and then Carbon only the following week, before taking a few weeks off altogether. I loved using this product for this purpose. You are not going to feel super dialed in or energized (or you may, again I'm a caffeine fiend!) but your workouts, strength, and RECOVERY will be greatly improved. I train intensely 6-7 times/week and always recovered well and rarely had any DOMS while using this product. Thanks Layne!\n",
      "I must start off by saying this is a VERY EFFECTIVE preworkout. But it's a bit odd in how you feel. I have never used a stim-free PWO before, so maybe this is how they all feel, but I didn't feel nearly as 'dialed in' as other stim ones. Despite that, I have had some of my best workouts by far, in terms of just weight lifted. Weight that normally would feel heavy, seemed lighter and I was able to do substantially more volume on them to boot. Very good product, very effective. Best part is I can do a intense workout at like 10PM, and still fall asleep easily when i go to bed. Would buy again.\n",
      "This is my favorite pre-workout I have ever tried! I've gone through many others including C4, N.O. explode,, jack3d, and B-nox, even resorted to mixing creatine & arginine myself. Then I found this. Great pumps and focus without the jitters and/or crash induced by some of these other products, and I can finish a workout with some HIIT without feeling like my chest is going to explode. Tastes AMAZING (and smells really good in the tub because of the cocoa powder). I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this to anybody. Give it a try, you w/on't be sorry. My only complaint, and the only reason that I didn't give 10/10 is that it's on the expensive side. Dr Norton, please come out with larger sizes and more flavors and you've got yourself a customer for life.\n",
      "I have purchased this product twice since its release and I will be reordering again when it comes out. If that doesnt speak for how much I enjoy this product I dont know what else will. \n",
      "\n",
      "I specifically enjoy that this Pre doesnt have any stimulants so you can take it any time during the day and not have to worry about staying up all night. You can always add caffeine if you need some sort of stim in your pre. \n",
      "\n",
      "I use both Prep & Recover and love the combo.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I really respect that Layne has produced videos explaining the ingredients and the dosage on his YouTube channel. I highly recommend viewing the videos and buying this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "PLEASE COME OUT WITH MORE FLAVORS AND BULK SIZES!!!  \n",
      "The best non-stim preworkout I have ever used. Great focus and great pumps while using it. \n",
      "Really enjoyed this pre workout! Great energy, no jitters of crash! Good flavor too. Love Layne's products... Would buy again!\n",
      "My favorite flavor of the two.  I love that I don't get jittery with this preworkout and can use it any time of the day adding my own caffeine if I want at morning workouts.  I feel focused and strong even after working all day in an active job.\n",
      "Perfect for me! I have been reliant on caffeine prep workouts for too long and have wanted to stop using stimulants to help me so much and this pre workout has helped me do that. I feel focused and strong. Prep has a great taste but it's a little strong for me (I'm sensitive to sweet stuff and get headaches) and it also makes me feel like I am not reliant on supplements to fuel my workout. I love his stuff. Will def keep buying. - Also recommend for you ladies that like to powerlift and bodybuild! Because that's what I do. \n",
      "Awesome! Best Pre I've ever used. Science FTW!\n",
      "Really great to have a properly dosed supplement for training at a reasonable price. I also dig the fact that i can take it for late night sessions. My schedule often pushes the workout till 11pm or later and I can take this and feel focused and sharp without feeling jittery or sketched out afterwards.  \n",
      "  Personally I'd rather be completely focused and in control when holding heavy *** weights suspended over my face or across my back. Most pre's only dust and severely under dose active ingredients like Citrulline Malate.  They rely on getting you hyped off ingredients that you 'feel\" like Beta-Alanine, excessive caffeine, and Niacin. For some, like myself it can leave you jittery and actually detract from your workout.  Those who enjoy it, are in luck as pre's like the aforementioned exist in spades. \n",
      "  Carbon should be in it's own class, \"pre-volution\" along with De Novo nutrition's Utopian.  And only taken by folks serious about making gains 💪\n",
      "Flavor was good. I could not tell that it did much for me. For me I will stick with the pre workouts that have stimulants. \n",
      "\n",
      "After using carbon prep for about a month I can honestly say I love the product. While I know most people will be quick to put the product down because of the price or that they don't \"feel\" the product working is ridiculous. Carbon Prep does exactly what its intended to do. My blood flow is better because of it. I never feel fatigued during my long workouts which is what I really want in my pre workout. Dr. Layne Norton even discusses how most companies that use blends will add Niacin to make you think you're feeling the product which I've noticed most of my friends like. Also, I've used products such as PreJym and Kaged which worked great for me however, I liked the stimulant free part of this product. If I need the extra caffeine I'll simply just add it. The taste of this product tastes great and dissolves quickly. For anyone wanting to try this product I would suggest trying it. The research is there. \n",
      "This product is great. Great focus and pump. I train at night and the bast part is it doesn't keep me up all night like other pre's did\n",
      "This has become the new staple in my stack. Prep has a great ingredient profile and the best part about it is the fact that you have the option to add stimulants. The pump and focus is phenomenal. Keep in mind you are paying for quality with this product. If you're skeptical of getting it because it doesn't have caffeine: buy caffeine pills or powder, it's very cheap.\n",
      "This product consists of many beneficial ingredients. Overall it only helped me with focus...and that was on a day that I had the recommend amount sleep the night before. I noticed that on the days I needed a little pick me up, it did not help at all. This is probably due to the lack of caffeine in the ingredient list. For someone who is very sensitive to stimulants or consumes caffeine throughout their day this would be a great product. But for me I'll be looking for another product with Similar ingredients but includes caffeine.\n",
      "Awesome product, I feel a lot better more power in my workouts...\n",
      "I was excited like everyone else to give this a try, but it absolutely did nothing for me.  It actually made me feel tired about an hour after taking it.  I'll be sticking with my staple from the tatted boss. \n",
      "I admire Layne as a fitness personality, and was really excited about his new line. Even tho taste is amazing, preworkout did absolutely nothing. I have a different product from different brand with about the same formula, and it gave me great pump, and lots of energy. \n",
      "I was disappointed by lack of any of those benefits by this product, sorry.\n",
      "I enjoy this product as a stim-free alternative to Pre-Jym. The ingredient profile is solid, so it gives me the pump and mental focus I need to lift some heavy stuff. Sometimes my schedule forces me to lift after 6, so I'm thankful there's a stim-free PreWorkout like this so I don't have any trouble sleeping after my workout. \n",
      "First off, thank you Dr. Norton for this awesome product! Most pre workouts are just glorified energy drinks. Carbon let me focus, so that I could dial into my workouts, rather than be distracted by my ears itching. There is time and care put into the formula, and that shows in the results. \n",
      "The flavor slightly reminded me of those flintstone's chewable vitamins I had when I was a kid... I hated those vitamins, so I may be a little biased. I'll definitely try the fruit punch next time! But that didn't take away from the value of the product. I would definitely recommend it!\n",
      "Great focus and endurance! I use it for evening work outs when I don't want to get hyped up on caffeine.  I've been disappointed when an hour long Zumba group fitness class is over because I still have energy to burn.  The taste is intense, but that's okay with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality recovery from a reputable source. Do the research and it's clear, Carbon is one of the highest quality supplements you can buy. Happy building!\n",
      "Foremost, I am a huge fan of Carbon, and can feel and see results every time I use it.  I also have put my trust in Layne Norton, and support his fight in the cause of combating anything not backed with rigorous scientific research.  Having said that, the flavor of both the fruit punch and cranberry grape is terrible.  To be fair, I have never honestly had any pre-workout supplement that tasted good, but that still doesn't make it excusable.  It simply is way too strong in a horrendous super sweet kind of way.  I've tried diluting it with everything I can think of, but haven't had any success yet. I've even gone so far as to mix it in 25 oz of water and its still not good and I get uncomfortably full from drinking so much water. Additionally, at the recommended dosage, it gets thick and frothy and leaves a gritty coating all the way down whatever container you are drinking it out of.  Regardless, I certainly will be a long-time user of this product so I can only hope they will do something to make the flavor more tolerable in the future.  IF this were to happen, I'll revise my rating to 10/10.\n",
      "So happy to find a pre-workout that I can rely on to give me the right dosage for maximum results! Prep has pushed my mental focus to a whole new level and gives such a great pump. Highly recommended. Very sweet so I mix it with a little more water but definitely not a bad thing! Also no-stim means no trouble sleeping and no feeling like you might actually EXPLODE. Love it.\n",
      "It was my first stim-free experience at one scoop and it literally did nothing for me. One of the hardest workouts I've had in a while. Two and a half scoops the next day and I felt a bit of energy, possibly placebo. The taste wasn't that bad but it was expensive cranberry juice from my experience and was a disappointing purchase. \n",
      "Awesome pre workout product!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're not into stims this is the one to go! Improved stamina, endurance and huge pumps!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cranberry grape tastes great\n",
      "I've only used Prep for a few workouts, but so far I'm in love. I like the fact that each ingredient is backed by peer-reviewed literature. It's no BS formula.I've noticed an increased work capacity and the focus is unbelievable. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a perfect pre workout. Only negative is i found the flavour to extremely strong.\n",
      "Exceptional pre workout and very versatile, focus and performance where on point!\n",
      "Usually when i take my pre workout at the end of the workout i crash because of too much caffeine but carbon keeps me focus till at the end of the workout and give me amazing focus , strength plus energy highly recommend ! \n",
      "This product has been great for me. I can really feel a difference in my workouts when I take it. Gives me really great focus and I can control the amount of caffeine I get with it. When I lift in the evenings I keep it to 100mg or im up all night. When I lift in the morning I smash 300mg. I love having that control along with a properly dosed formula. Cranberry grape flavor I was skeptical of but it really is great. 12oz of water tho or it is strong. \n",
      "One of the better tasting pre workouts. \n",
      "Between the two carbon supplements, I have been able to cut down on the amount of bottles in my cabinet. It has everything you need pre and post workout. Every ingredient backed by science and has a purpose. I have recommended it to my clients. Cost effective and good taste. \n",
      "Great product, 6g's of Citrulline Malate per serving?  Yes plz, buying that alone is pricey as is.  While you might want more than 20 servers per container I can vouch that this is a complete pre workout and you feel great focus while taking it and Carbon actually contains a complete ingredient profile with 1 serving.  Not shoving in a small dose of a high profile ingredient and calling it a day.\n",
      "love the flavor, i typically only take half a scoop . I workout in the AM so I love that i can drink coffee with this \n",
      "Great product. Taste of cran grape was phenomenal. You notice a smooth, subtle cognition boost, increased focus, and fatigue resistance. \n",
      "Great pre workout without all of the added stims. Constant energy throughout the day. Not to mention, created by an intelligent, reputable and trustworthy individual. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great product, and performs as advertised. A little sweet, but my biggest complaint is the serving size. It is recommended to pair prep with recovery, which I did and also love. However, the serving sizes do not match - Prep is 20 per container and Recovery is 30. A minor inconvenience yes, but can't you guys just make Prep 30 as well? As Layne said, these products are for those with a little bit of disposable incomes that have everything else dialed in and are looking for that little edge. I don't mind paying the difference.    \n",
      "Great product! I really noticed an increase in pump, and natural energy. I like the no hype attitude, and products that Layne puts out.  \n",
      "The Cranberry Grape flavor is true to its name, and while this flavor is decent, it doesn't taste near as good as other pre-workout flavors such as Icy Blue Razz C4. Nevertheless, I still enjoy drinking this. \n",
      "Now for the product review; if you have every used nootropics or Denovo Nutritions \"Utopia(n)\" pre-workout, this is very similar. Since there are no stimulants, you will not feel the \"jitters\", but instead you are completely focused. Therefore, if you're a person who wants a pre-workout that totally gets you in the zone mentally, this is for you. I gave the overall rating an 8 because I personally like the little jitters, but still, this product is top notch and Layne certainly did a fantastic job. \n",
      "I was in the market for a pre with this profile, just without the stims because I started working out later in the day instead of the mornings, and I love it! I ordered this to go along with PH3 and so far I am making so considerable strength gains. My only critique is the flavor is overly sweet. A word to the wise, mix with AT LEAST 16 oz of water, and not the 10 recommended!\n",
      "Best taste of any preworkout I've tried.  Had an excellent workout added a few set and excercises . Only a 9 since I did add some caffeine.  Looking forward to tomorrow.\n",
      "I ordered this product because I am very sensitive to stimulants and this is a stimulant free formula. I took it only for a few days, it did not give me jitters and it seemed to improve my focus but unfortunately all the days I took it, I ended up with a headache. I am not sure what it is, but for now I am staying off. I will try it again in the next couple of weeks and see if I still get the headaches. \n",
      "The flavor was amazing, not too sweet and a little tart. \n",
      "\n",
      "It works. More reps, more weight. I'm not convinced it isn't a potion of the blood of my fallen enemies. Other pre-workouts hit like a ton of bricks and make me jittery, but this gave me a calm, almost serene boost of energy. C4 makes you feel like a warrior, stomping around and showing off. Carbon makes you feel like a king. On Carbon, you KNOW you're better than everyone else. It's kinda like being the Buddha of lifting; the certainty of that last rep going up is nirvana. \n",
      "I'm a fan of science. Layne delivers with his scientifically backed formula. Initially, I was hesitant about pricing, however, on finding out this is the only pre workout that contains the same amounts of expensive ingredients as used in studies ( ie citrulline malate) I had to purchase it.  I soon was able to take myself off the stimulant based pre woekouts.   Workouts have been awesome. Taste is great as well as mixability, but I'm not a fan of taste in general.  I want something that stimulates muscle growth, doesn't get me dependent in stimulants, and it can also be stacked with other pre workouts should the need arise. An awesome product. Buy it!\n",
      "I've been using PreJym for the longest time, and I thought that I might try something new. When I saw Carbon, I thought it would be great, but I was sadly mistaken. I mean don't get me wrong, for other people it might be great, but it had no effect on me. I was grinding through my workouts for the first time in a long time. The taste is ok, I had the fruit punch, it kind of tastes like the Flintstones vitamins I used to take as a kid. Overall I was pretty disappointed, and am definitely going back to PreJym.\n",
      "As a huge follower of Layne i knew i was going to try this product. I had been using Pre Jym for over 2 years and thought nothing was better, i was really hesitant to try this pre since there is no caffeine and i am a caffeine junky. WOW is all i have to say, im truly blown away with how well this works. For me i workout after work in the evening and the no caffeine thing is truly amazing. So much energy and focus and then the best thing of all - i fall asleep so quickly at night, the taste could be better but its not bad by any means. Layne your awesome and thanks for all you continue to do. This is my pre workout from now on, it works guys trust it.\n",
      "I was looking for a pre-workout without stimulants, since I usually workout after work and I need some energy, but I don't want to stay up all night. Luckily, I was listening to Mark Bell's Powercast recently, and Layne Norton was the featured guest. I've listened to Layne before, and I'm constantly impressed by his knowledge of nutrition and his honesty about the effectiveness of supplements. When he mentioned that he would be releasing a supplement line on bb.com, I immediately checked it out and ordered the pre-workout, and I haven't been disappointed. The flavor is pretty solid, and it mixes very well. It gives me a great amount of focus so I can really dial in on my form throughout my sets, and also increases blood flow to the muscles being worked, so I feel like I'm getting a pump even though I'm not doing bodybuilding work. I also really appreciate how he explains the significance and dosing of each ingredient with credible citations; gotta respect that. Really good stuff from Layne, I'd definitely recommend it.\n",
      "I also reviewed the post workout.  I can tell you that this product has given me the energy and endurance I need four weeks before a competition.  I am cutting and feel as tough my workouts are intensified and my HIIT is bearable.  Thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the flavor being exceptional and following best empirical data, the effectiveness of this product is astounding. Extremely effective, leaving you focused and pumped. Will continue to purchase. \n",
      "I tried this today before a squat workout and was blown away this is stim free!\n",
      "Intense focus and overall a solid pre workout.\n",
      "Hopefully we get some more flavors soon.\n",
      "The taste was on point. The best flavored pre I have ever had. It mixed really well with no clumps. I really enjoyed the focus from this product. I enjoy that this is stim-free since I tend to workout a few hours right before bed. \n",
      "The taste is on point.  I also like that it doesn't have caffeine and I can mix it in if and when I need it.   \n",
      "I really enjoyed the taste and loved the focus I got from this product.  Layne is a great, honest guy, I am not surprised his supplement is awesome.\n",
      "Loved the flavor of these bars. Definitely more like a candy bar than a health food! I would consider this more of a fat source than a protein source which provides even better energy! \n",
      "Tastes like an almond joy candy bar! a little sweet for my taste. unfortunately i wish it had more source of protein. otherwise its a god tasting protein bar\n",
      "I was so surprised by how great the taste and texture of this jerky is. Usually I'm a beef jerky girl, but this chicken jerky may have me converted. \n",
      "This is AWESOME jerky. The macros are great, and the flavor (especially Chipotle Honey) is on point. I liked the Chipotle more than the Buffalo Style. The only thing that's weird is that they're formed into sticks. I like jerky that still kinda looks like the meat, like most Turkey and Beef Jerky. But other than that, great product and great snack option.\n",
      "Great jerky, I like the bbq and buffalo flavor.  It's hard to find jerky with little to no added sugar.  This has less than zero to 1 gram carb, and it is all natural.  You Can't Beat This stuff!!!!!\n",
      "I like that it's not too chewy (it's chewy but not tough of the teeth). The taste is eh, okay- a little on the dog food side.\n",
      "Product works fine and very strong. Just for information if you have a case on your phone like I do which is the otter box around my samsung galaxy you need to remove your protective case so it will stick to the phone itself. It will not suction to the Otterbox case.\n",
      "Awesome pre-workout that I ever had. great taste. Best results while workouts, pumping muscles and giving lots of energy during workout..\n",
      "I've been working out for a few years and I never taken a pre-workout before. This gives me a bit of an energy boost but not strong enough to make a huge difference but it does work. I eventually started doing 1.5 -2 scoops. The taste is amazing doesn't have chunks or and after taste. \n",
      "i have to say that this is the best pre-workout supplement, taste is great and how i feel at the gym is awesome, it  keeps me motivated throughout my work out.  thank you cellucor\n",
      "What a joke! This has the same amount of caffeine as a soda or a coffee. This did absolutely nothing for me but keep me up at night. No energy whatsoever. Used it for two days and was hospitalized for a stomach ulcer caused by c4.\n",
      "This is a great pre workout I get a boost of energy that lasts about 45 minutes With 2 scoops I was able to do more reps and lift more but I do wish it was more intense of a feeling but still does the job.. the blue Razz flavor tasted like poison to me I had a tough time chugging it.. but the fruit punch flavor tastes really good it tastes like fruit punch kool aid.. But if your a morning workout person this might be a problem for some people because it Made me crash during work Pretty hard I felt like sleeping for most of my shift..\n",
      "Perfect for my early morning work outs.  I generally do 1.5 scoops in 25 oz of water and start drinking 30 minutes before and into the first 15 minutes of my workout.  Gives me great focus and the extra push I need, especially for the heavy days!\n",
      "Great Pre-workout,  definitely feel the tingle and affects within 5 minutes of consumption.  Gives a great pump during workout as well.  I would highly recommend this if you are looking into adding Pre-workout to your supplement regimen.\n",
      "Great product overall.  Sometimes I would get some tingling, probably from the beta-alanine.  The Blue Razz is the best tasting!  The Lemonade tastes very strong.  Same with the fruit punch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product, flavor is a little too strong but I add more water to it for a balance. Great pump and energy. No jitters. Great product for the money. \n",
      "I've been using C4 since it's 3rd generation and I still love it! I cycle on and off and still manage to get that beta alanine itch from just one scoop. My workouts are noticeably more fun and overall better after taking C4. I love all Cellucor products, mainly because they taste amazing, but this one is my favorite due to its' effectiveness. Highly recommend the green apple (if getting 30 servings) and the blue razz (if getting 60 servings).\n",
      "Been using this product for almost 6 months. Fantastic taste, easy to mix, and gives excellent pumps. What more can I ask for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "best pre workout product! its delicious, no jitters, and just the right amount of everything you need for a good workout. I've been using it for about a year and tried different products but haven't found anything close to this one. I am 25 and work out 6-7 times a week. \n",
      "Gives a good boost and tastes decent too. The fruit punch is very strong but not bad, the dreamsicle is more tame tasting but has same effect.\n",
      "Great pre workout take it in the morning and usually works pretty well. I like it because after the two hours at the gym it's dead. But I do wish there was something a little stronger \n",
      "Tried blue raz, flavor was great, was able to drink without having to chug it. Did not upset my stomach. Got some good pumps in on this\n",
      "i love this pre workout, favorite flavor green apple. Some people hate the tingling sensation, I already got used to it and I actually like that. It gives me that extra pump I need when needing to give the extra mile to complete my workouts. \n",
      "Effective yet tasteful pre-workout!\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you been looking for a quick, energizing caffeine boost before lifting? If you have, Cellucor C4 Pre-workout is right for you! Cellucor’s unique blend of ingredients is perfect for a variety of lifters whether you’re just starting out in the gym, or you compete in bodybuilding competitions. Despite the fact that I’m an avid coffee drinker, Cellucor C4 always gives me an incredible surge of energy before my lifts as well as a better muscle pump. While I have tried other pre-workouts, I always come back to Cellucor C4 due to the wide variety of unique flavors, the effectiveness and the high quality product I always receive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste:\n",
      "One of my favorite aspects of this pre-workout is the taste. Cellucor offers their pre-workout in 12 different flavors, my favorite being the pink lemonade. Some of the more unique flavors they offer include: green apple, orange dreamsicle and strawberry margarita. With so many different options to choose from, there is a flavor out there for everyone and it takes a while to get bored of the brand. Not only is the taste very good, the blend of ingredients used is designed to not leave any sort of “sandy” or “gritty” flavor in your mouth or the bottom of your shaker cup. I have tried other, less expensive pre-workouts that have not been as successful in coming up with that sort of ingredient blend; taking those pre-workouts seems more like a chore than doing something to help me have an intense workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Effectiveness:\n",
      "The main ingredient in this pre-workout is beta-alaine which helps to delay muscle fatigue. Therefore, while this product is not used for long, cardio endurance training, it is great for interval and high resistance training! It also contains creatine nitrate, something not all pre-workouts contain, so it makes this product unique. Creatine helps increase muscle strength and size, while the nitrate helps to dissolve product, so there’s no grittiness at the bottom of your shaker bottle. Another important ingredient is arginine alphaketoglutarate (AKG) that works well with the nitrate to help blood flow to the muscles. A final marketed aspect of this product is the energy-boosting blend. This blend contains 150 mg of caffeine per serving and since I often take 2 servings (2 scoops), I’m able to get 300 mg of caffeine before my workout. While some people may not like the “feeling of bees under the skin” after taking this pre-workout, I don’t mind it because it gets my pumped and gives me the motivation to get through my entire workout. \n",
      "\n",
      " Quality:\n",
      "A downfall to this pre-workout is the price; each serving costs around $1. Since I sometimes require two scoops before my lift, this ends up costing me $2 per workout. I have found other pre-workouts on the market that cost anywhere between $0.65-$0.85 per serving, a significantly lower price. However, these products do not contain as high quality ingredients as those found in Cellucor’s C4, resulting in not feeling as much of a surge in energy. Cellucor offers the ability to order a 5-serving “trial” of any flavor, which is great if you want to try a new flavor but not ready to commit to 30 or 60 servings. \n",
      "\n",
      "If lifting is something you’re passionate about, I would definitely recommend Cellucor’s C4 Pre-workout! While the cost is on the higher end, it is definitely worth it, in my opinion. With Cellucor’s C4 Pre-workout, you’ll get a great tasting, effective and high quality source of quick energy to help you push through your workout.\n",
      "The best pre-workout I have tried so far. Doesn't make your stomach upset. I feel like I go harder and longer. When I take C4 I have to kick myself out of the gym. You won't be disappointed. Flavor is on point too. I don't have to slam it while holding my breath. 2 scoops in a tall glass of water. \n",
      "Really disappointed with the 30 serving option.  I received a 5 serving sample, and I loved it all 5 times I took it pre-workout.  My workouts were more intense, and I felt pumped.  I haven't felt the that sensation from any workout since I got the 30-serving canister.  Even double-servings don't do it.  I am going to with something else.\n",
      "Product works but need two scoops to feel it. \n",
      "Gives me energy before my workout for sure. It works \n",
      "good product great taste .my only downfall is it takes me two scoops to feel anything  but overall a good product\n",
      "I have used C4 in the past and had great results, but this recipe tasted chalky and sour.  I didn't get the same pumped up, ready to workout feeling like the past samples. I heard they had changed the recipe a couple years ago. If that's true and the old fruit punch was available I'd try it again, otherwise I couldn't get over the taste and lack of performance.\n",

      "I love C4.  I dont currently use it because there are pre work outs that have a better profile of ingredients out there.  But, nothing gives me a pump like C4.  I purchase it once in a while and use it on arm day.  \n",

      "Pre Work out that does what is promised, energy, strength and the flavor in this case was just perfect, I add one scoop to 8 OZ of cold water in my shaker mix ability is perfect no residues at the bottom of the shaker cup.\n",
      "Strawberry Margarita flavor was excellent, bit of creaminess to round out the flavor, so it's not overly tart. I've been looking around for pre-workout supps that do NOT include Niacin. After purchasing this product, I watched Dr. Jim Stoppani's video on why Niacin is included in pre-workouts: basically there's zero need for it, and actually, companies put it in their pre-workout products to make the consumer think that it's actually doing something by giving you that skin-burning sensation (which I hate anyway). Beta-alanine does this also, and it's very uncomfortable. So far I've found that Muscletech Anarchy is Niacin free (but there's no anti-caking agent in the product and it's very hygroscopic, so it arrived as large clumps with about 5% loose powder), as well as Pre-Jym of course.\n",

      "Body building.  I kinda of feel like my review won't be that good because the only other pre work out I have ever used is jacked.  With that being said I love c4.  This specific product has helped me so much with motivation in the gym and loving what I'm doing in the gym.  Of course I got watermelon because it is just my favorite flavor. Hope my personal positive stamp of this product helps.\n",

      "I love how well it mixes, you don't have to use a shaker bottle or anything. I like the taste ,sweet but not too sweet, with other pre-workouts I would have to chug it down because they would have that chemical taste to it. This one is far from it, I can just sip it  like it is a juice. Also,  I did not have any jitters after drinking it. I would highly recommencement it \n",

      "Flavor: 10/10. I absolutely love the berry bomb flavor. I dont know that it's a true berry flavor but it tastes delicious either way. Goes down smooth with no after taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability: 10/10. I mix it in a shaker cup with 10-12 ounces of water, recommended is 6 ounces. Whether I mix it in 6 or 12 it mixes easily and leaves no grit in the bottom of my cup. \n",

      "Energy: 10/10. I take 1.5 servings and it really gets me going for even the toughest workouts.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is my first Pre workout and I love it. In the beginning days I used to get little tingles but i simply love it. I tried with two scoops I felt thats too much to understand. But I get a good work out after taking this. Thank you Cellucor for a nice genuine product.\n",
      "I love this pre workout! I have used C4 products for some time now and have always liked their line. Their product always delivers great performance. It comes in a nice heavy jar filled up with powder!\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently purchased the C4 pre-workout in Berry Bomb flavor. I have used C4 pr-workout before, so I wanted to taste the new flavor. The pre-workout mix was great, and doesn't make you feel shaky. It just gives you an awesome pump of energy. The taste is one of my favorites. It's sweet but not too sweet. I think the more supplements I try I get used to different tastes, but this was a pleasant taste right off the bat. I recommend this product for both taste and effectiveness. Cheers to my lifters!\n",
      "This is one of my favorite preworkouts to use. Doesn't make my face/head itch like some others. Berry bomb is a great flavor, watermelon was a little too sour for my liking. But overall really enjoy this product and will continue to use!\n",
      "I got this product a week ago, and having been using it while training the last 5 days. It is awesome, the flavor is great, not too sweet or syrupy, and the energy and focus are exactly what you'd expect from a Cellucor product. I have thoroughly enjoyed using it and can't wait to continue.\n",
      "C4 has been a regular in my Preworkout rotation for ever it seems like, great energy for me even at 1 scoop and gets me thru every workout, have to go with an 8 just because the new Ripped and Neuro options are soooo great! I will still buy the original from time to time though I'm sure.\n",
      "This new flavor is amazing!!! I've taken it a few times now and it was hard to put my finger on it but I think it tastes like pop rocks or a certain kind of double bubble, bubble gum. Either way, it is very enjoyable. It mixes pretty well. Just like the other flavors of C4. It's a good addition to the family!!\n",
      "This pre-workout is great! While it is a tad lower stimmed, I enjoyed taste, lasting energy, and killer pumps I was still able to obtain!  I trained arms and shoulders today and the pumps were legit/10!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was intrigued to try this flavor of their new pre-workout as I have yet to try any pre-workout with a \"berry\" flavor included! That and it's Cellucor- we all know they only put out the best of the best products!\n",
      "\n",
      "While I did not get a full \"berry\" taste, I did taste some sort of a fruit and maybe a little punch taste in it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I simply mixed two scoops (YOLO) in 12oz of water and it was nice and sweet! Not overly sweet, but the kind that is tolerable where you can sip, or chug it and still want more!\n",
      "Green apple exclusive flavor isn't listed but that is by far my favorite flavor. This has been by my go-to preworkout, I have had trouble finding one I like until now. The beta-alanine gives a little added tingle which sometimes I think I need more for my head because I don't always feel a huge pump. Just knowing it's there and feeling the tingle helps liven me up and get me going sometimes even if the added burst isn't always there. But all in all though this remains my top choice, all others still haven't come close. I also like the watermelon and blue razz flavors. Have yet to try any others. (First few sips will taste super artificial but it quickly grows on you.)\n",
      "Nothing too crazy, I've had better.\n",
      "This a great pre-workout especially if you have a long after work..\n",
      "This is by far the best pre-workout I have tried. I get the energy I need without jitters. It last through my whole workout, keeping me pumped up the whole way through. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great pre-workout.\n",
      "Ok...I use to be a Jackd3d fan but they changed the formula and it was not nearly as potent as before.   I bought some C4 because I really like Cellucor products.    I love this stuff.  It does not make you to jittery but gives you the boost you need.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent pre workout. The stuff really works. I can go through all of my workout routines at two scoops, without any issues. Love that Orange!! \n",
      "I used to take this a lot during my Olympic weightlifting days as a pre workout. It is a solid pre workout that will not waste your money, it will give you solid steady energy throughout the training session. C4 was great due to it being not to strong and just good enough some pre workouts make you feel to stimulated and like crap. This stuff also has done great ingredients in it as well. Overall a solid pre workout gives you a good pump energy focus. \n",
      "If you're looking for an efficient yet very tasteful preworkout, C4 is for you!  It has the correct dosage of caffeine, beta-alanine, citrulline, and creatine nitrate to take your workout to the next level.  I never have to take more than two scoops of it and this is coming from somebody who is very stim-tolerant.  The effects last well until the end of my hour and 15 minute average workouts.  The mixability is excellent inside of a shaker cup and remains good amongst additions you may add.  Taste is excellent from watermelon, to strawberry margarita, and then the fruit punch flavor.  My favorite would have to be the watermelon followed by strawberry margarita.  It tastes just like a cocktail!  One of the best and most popular in the market for good reason!\n",
      "C4 is my number one go to pre-workout.  I thought that the pineapple flavor was good. This product always gives me a solid energy boost and pump in the gym, definitely a recommended buy.   \n",
      "I really enjoy C4 by cellucor, its one of my favorites I always keep this in my house\n",
      "Great product and taste. Same results as all other pre-work outs for energy.\n",
      "Holy heck, green apple taste like a liquid jolly rancher. It's so good! \n",
      "\n",
      "This pre-workout has been fueling my workouts all week. After being disappointed with a different brand, a friend suggested that I use Cellucor. Totally worth the purchase. It's great. I also use this with Cellucor Alpha Aminos intra workout. Great combo and definitely the best stack I've used.\n",
      "C4 is a great buy! Several brands out there make me feel sick to my stomach- C4 does not. It tastes great and has just the right amount of Beta-Alanine and caffeine to get me going and keep me going.  Many negative reviews say it is a \"weak\" preworkout, but I feel it is its subtleness that makes it such a great product.  I love the gym and don't need to get hit by a freight train of caffeine and whatever else to challenge myself. I also don't want to feel like I need to crawl out of my skin due to itching, or puke from preworkout overload. With C4, I get that rush of energy that sustains me through my pump. I also get all the benefits of Beta-Alanine with only mild itchiness (it goes aways once I start my warm-up). I enjoy these benefits without the side effects usually felt from other types of preworkout. C4 has great flavors as well as mixability. When I work out in the early morning, I can mix it in with whey, or take it on an empty stomach.  It helps me stay focused and reach various PRs and I leave the gym feeling great.  If you need an \"extreme\" preworkout that \"f-s you up\"- this product isn't for you. If you want a product that tastes great, wakes you up (physically and mentally) and doesn't turn you into a preworkout meme, C4 is the best possible buy for your money.\n",
      "This is a pretty good pre workout. I like that it only has 150mg of caffeine because I work out in the evening and it doesn't keep me awake all night. The taste is exactly that of a granny smith apple but when you're at the bottom of the cup with some powder that didn't mix the taste is extremely sour. I'd prefer if they put 2g of creatine instead of 1 but it does the job of getting me motivated to lift. Overall a good pre workout for the price.\n",
      "I started to use C4 when I first started working out, but since I'm a big guy even two large scoops didn't have much of an affect on me after about two weeks of using it. If you need something strong I would not recommend this, but if you're on the smaller side this is probably good for you.\n",
      "First time pre-workout user and all i can say is...wow.  I take it as i'm leaving work and by the time i get to the gym i feel like i can flip over a car.   I have no real basis of comparison to competing products,  but this definitely does the trick.  \n",
      "Tastes like a watermelon jolly rancher and gets you in the mood to crush a workout! \n",
      "great product by cellucor. as just a product to get the blood pumping and help get the mindset to destroy in the gym this product does very well. some don't like the tingly sensations it gives but i like to feel it. the taste of the ones i have tried have all been nothing short but amazing, mixes very well. i would like to see more quality ingredients added into this product as i feel they could do better to prepare the body for the workout. overall 9/10 for me\n",
      "I have been though a single 30 serving tub and a few sample packs. Strawberry Kiwi, watermelon and fruit punch all tastes fine to me. Don't love them, but they are tolerable. I use about 10 - 12 oz of water to 1 scoop and shake vigoursly in a Nalgene bottle. Mixes well enough, although there is some residue in the bottom of the bottle after finishing it off. I simply refill the bottle and drink it while at the gym. All is gone by the time I do this. \n",
      "\n",
      "It does not make me feel jittery! This is big to me because I put off prework out drinks because some I have tried in the past did. Plus, no headaches throughout the day, which is another bonus. I do get a bit of a tingly feeling on big pushes, usually in my face, and on occasion at the location of the muscle I am working, but not often. Most importantly, since I get up at 4 am for my workouts, I can tell this gets me going, but without that tunnel vision type of focus, which for me is what I want.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like this product for my pre work out drinks and will continue to drink them. I am about to start the green apple flavor!\n",
      "The best tasting pre work out out there and definitely gets you amped and ready to lift everything in your path. \n",
      "it's ****ght, i'd need like 3 scoops to get a feel though\n",
      "Reputation speaks for itself. Everything it claims to be. Watermelon tastes exactly like a watermelon jolly rancher.\n",
      "I like the fact its quick and easy to make, and you can drink it quick as opposed to other pre workouts. I have always had a great workout when this is my pre-workout.\n",
      "The beta alanine and caffeine content gave me a nice buzz, but it mixed horribly. There is always (what appears to be) pre-workout at the bottom of my glass/mixer after drinking it. After trying a variety of other pre-workouts, this red flags me the contents are not good quality.   \n",
      "I can barely gag this flavor down. It's absolutely terrible. I used to buy the Pineapple flavor and REALLY enjoyed it, along with the great energy and pump I'd get from working out using it. I still get the itchies that motivate me to lift harder, but honestly, the flavor is so off-putting that I wish I'd never ordered it. Bring back the pineapple, ffs!\n",
      "Can't go wrong with c4!\n",
      "I tried the blue razz flavor and it tasted great. C4 gives you all the extra energy you need for a great workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "I like the pre-workout but the orange dreamsicle flavor is gross. I am not even going to finish this 30 servings.\n",
      "This is the third flavor of C4 that I have tried, and even though it tasted absolutely wonderful, it was more chalky than the green apple or fruit punch variety. \n",
      "C4 is a great pre-workout.  The only reason it does not get a 10 is due to the fact that after a week you have to up the dosage to get the same effects.  But that could just be due to the fact that I have used it many time before.\n",
      "LOVE THE EFFECTS ,,,,, JUST ONE QUESTION WHY IS THE SCOOP SO SHORT?  LOL\n",
      "I drink coffee and energy drinks about 3-5 times a YEAR so my caffeine tolerance isn't that high. One scoop definitely gets me pumped and the watermelon flavored C4 tastes so good; I tried buying Blue Razz but they were out of stock at the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal favorite preworkout! I can always feel when it kicks in, and it's great. It's nothing that makes me jittery or feel like I'm going crazy, I just feel the need to move and do more. I have seen improvements in my running training. There has been sometimes where I do get the tingly feeling that they warn about, it is not bad, but just odd at times. I would recommend this to anyone who asks about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gives you that lovely face buzz and has your neck tingling. I find it gives me a really good boost in the gym. This is only the 3rd PWO that I've tried and I've now ordered 3 tubs of this. It could mix a little better but it's nowhere near as gritty as the Grenade 50 Cal stuff. The Fruit Punch is a bit of an odd flavour, it couldn't be described as a pleasurable beverage to drink. Just neck it and think of England.\n",
      "Stop looking, I tried all those pre-workouts who claim they are number one. But C4 always remains my all time favorite! Explosive workout with this one!\n",
      "I LOVE the tingling effect it gives, so if you don't like that, you might want to stay away from this product. \n",
      "Not a big fan of the taste, it's OK. But its not an important thing when you witness the impressive effects when you use C4.\n",
      "I have tried many pre-workout sups,and what works best for me is cellucor C4. It gives me just the right amount of boost and energy and focus to begin my workout. I love it.\n",
      "Great pre-workout, Provided you pick a flavor that isn't hard to choke back.  The Strawberry Margarita flavor will be my go to pre-workout for the foreseeable future.  Orange Dreamsicle?  Not so much.  Beyond the flavors though, there is a great boost to energy without feeling \"stimmed out of my gourd.\"  Strong Beta-Alanine effect, but I can never tell if that's just how I react to that substance or not.  Good pump, and boost to the workout in general, and keeps me going hard the whole time.  Will definitely buy again. \n",
      "Took C4 for a really long time. Great pre-workout. Like any of them though, you need to come off and on of it otherwise your body gets to used to it. That or alternate between different pre-workouts. One of my favorites!\n",
      "Been using it for a long time. It works for me. Sometimes I get the tingles 20 minutes after drinking it, which I like. Nothing negative to say about it really. I usually take a little less than 1 dose. Never use it more than 4 times in a week. When I run out of pre-workout I use that time to cycle off of it for 2-4 weeks until I buy by next one.\n",
      "Flavor isn't bad, but does nothing for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried a few pre-workouts but nothing tasted good to me until I tried the green apple C4. I love this preworkout. It mixes well with water. I mix one scoop with 15 g of a non flavored whey and one scoop of Xtend BCAA Green Apple. It really is my favorite. I hope they make this flavor for their other C4 products. \n",
      "Great Product, flavor is Good and results are Great! When I want a good workout I use this product! \n",
      "I love this pre workout.  It was the first one I've tried that I've had success with. Others I've tried always make me feel jittery, but this one did not. It gave me just the boost I needed to get through tough workouts.\n",
      "This pre work out is awesome. It helps get my emery pumped up and ready for a workout. It does make my body tingle some but once I get started in my workout it seems to vanish. I love love love this stuff. The razz is my favorite. I tried the strawberry margarita and it's okay but not as good as blue razz\n",
      "Great flavor, mixes well in the blender bottle, and gives you that tingly feeling every time you use it so you know it's working and you will be able to push through your workout. If you weren't motivated to go and complete your workout, this will definitely help you out with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have used a few different pre-workout supplements, and I do find that this one helps me to have additional energy for my workout. My only complaint is that when it kicks in, to me, it feels a little like a hyper caffeine high. I personally prefer a pre-workout that is less aggressive up front but that helps me to push through a hard workout. Realizing that everyone is different, I would recommend trying this, to form your own opinion.\n",
      "This is as good as it gets when it comes to pre-workout. The flavor is excellent and the tingle from the beta alanine is un-matched. This is the easiest go-to, and I highly recommend this product. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Wal-Mart \"sport\" edition has nothing on the original C4; spend the extra ten bucks for the real deal. \n",
      "I have used c4 for over a year now and it seems to do the job.\n",
      "I'm a little immune to caffeine and drinking coffee and redbull and such never really got me going.\n",
      "I've tried couple other pre work outs but this one seems to work the best.\n",
      "I get a little good boost and get amped up. Not too much that i'm going crazy and beast mode (which i do like to transform at times haha)\n",
      "Taste better than any other pre work outs too... I hated working out and started burping and tasted the god awful pre work outs as i was working out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dont always use it for my workouts but 75% of my work outs i use it. 1 scoop is all you need. 2 and you are ready to murder the weights. (and your body is murdered in return the next day)\n",
      "\n",
      "This preworkout was overall not the worst but not my favorite as well. I did feel more focused and energized but I will not purchase this again because this preworkout made me extremely itchy. It did go away once I started to workout. The taste was not bad, it was easily tolerable, considering most preworkouts taste like vomit. The texture was gritty near the bottom of my drink but that doesn't bother me the slightest. An overall good product.\n",
      "First time taking a pre workout, and C4 was awesome. Mixes very well with water, taste very good, and over all very satisfied with the results. Hits me in ten minuets, and pushes me to get that extra rep in. Will continue to purchase, and surely refer my friends.\n",
      "I have had MP before and this one. I am absolutely not a pro lifter. I feel great if I stay an hour at the gym. That being said, I lift to my max always. When I had MP, I had to mix it with a lot of water and drinking that before the workout always left me feel bloated during workout. It gave me a great initial boost though. It did not last long and after workout I was totally trashed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I prefer C4 over MP from now on. C4 does not give me as much as the initial boost I got from MP but it lasts all the way through my workout. I am about to order again after a three month break from it. I tried to push myself without it but no way. I did not think it mattered that much to be honest but now that I have not had more than 3 months, I am convinced that I am wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "C4 can also mix with a smaller amount of water. Usually the 12/16oz bottles you get from anywhere is enough to mix a serving. I like that a lot because I feel more at ease when I start working out. Watermelon tastes great. Does not leave after taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are the type who spends 2+ hours at the gym because you wanna bend the metal and you feel you are never big enough, you may look for something else / stronger. If you are like me, who just wants to let steam off and does not necessarily need to get huge but dont mind it if you do, you want this. That being said, I am 6'3'' 245lbs and I do 400lbs shoulder shrugs. I am definitely not small. I am trying to say that I think I fell more into the general gym member category and I think this product fits me perfect. \n",
      "Not what I expected, but not disappointed.   Decent pre-workout that doesn't leave you with a crash afterwards. I've had better but also a lot worse. Gives a good pump and fair amount energy during your workout. Recommend to moderate or beginning lifters.\n",
      "Taste is great & extra pump you get is even better. The only downside is the itchies I get from taking it. I had not taken a pre-workout in a few years so I am sure the itchiness and tingles will go away after a few more uses when my body gets use to the product. Highly recommend!\n",
      "\n",
      "I like C4 Pre-Workout because it gives me that extra boost I need right before I hit the gym. I mix one scoop with about 12oz of water and chug it before I start my warmup. The experience for me, is kind of like drinking a very strong coffee beverage from Starbucks. My heart beat rises, I am able to warm my muscles up quickly, and begin lifting weights until I reach failure. It's great! I recommend this product to anyone like me who is JUST BEGINNING or GETTING BACK INTO THE GYM AFTER SEVERAL YEARS. \n",
      "What's to say...it's C4. It'll work for awhile, take a month off then use it again. It's my go to whenever I run out of Kill It or don't want over 9,000 milli's of caffeine a day. \n",
      "BTW watermelon tastes awesome like a jolly rancher. \n",
      "Taste is great if you use the recommend amount of water. It also mixes well with other cellucor products. \n",
      "The best pre-workout supplement - I've tried many but for the price/ value per scoop, I always return to C4. Great pump, sweat - you'll need to stay hydrated to make this work. \n",
      "Alright, since I tolerate caffeine to a high degree, my first dose was 2 scoops, I had it with 250ML water, added dmaa and 10g citrulline; citrulline I believe gave most of the pumps, not many pumping agents in the pre workout but it still added overall. As for pumps I would go and say 7/10, don't take my word for it though, it's probably an estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Warning] When taking 2 scoops with 250ml water started to give me an acdic burn, but do as I did to counter the effect by drinking water after that, disappears in a hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effects:\n",
      "\n",
      "Felt like the first time I have ever taken I pre workout, it was amazing, tried assault but this is much better, in my opinion. Altough i added my own dmaa, i've done it with other pre-workouts and i must say this pre workout hit me amazingly, I was screaming C4!! And other things and deadlifted like mad, my bench was instantaneously better. I would go as far to say \"best pre-workout I have tried\". This stuff is no joke, I was hyped as hell and again felt like it was my first time taking pre workout that's because of the teacor! I recommed to everyone, I'm going back to 1scoop to save servings and it's not necessary taking 2 scoops unless you're doing your 1rep max days! good good I would have give a 9.8 out of 10 but im just rounding it off.\n",
      "Old faithful. I like to rotate preworkouts and always seem to come back to C4. Nice focus, and motivation. If you havent had C4 you probably live under a rock, LOL.\n",
      "C4 was the best prework I have ever bought! I will continue to keep purchasing this. I absolutely  love the feeling it gives you, Overall very good product. \n",
      "One of the best pre workouts hands down. Just like any other pre workout, I took this empty stomach and it has never disappointed me. Suppressed my appetite, pumps were great and I had energy all day long. I hate it when I don't take this product as I tend to avoid any type of caffeine for 3-4 weeks before starting again.\n",
      "This is a great product. It taste great and mixes well. I am a 5am lifter and it definitely gives my workouts a pick me up.\n",
      "To date, and after trying several different varieties, this remains my favorite pre-workout. Within minutes I feel it starting to take effect, and by the time I've driven the 10-15 minutes to my gym I feel like there's nothing I can't lift. A lot of people complain about the \"itching\" feeling, or as I call it \"Face Tinglies\" as that's generally where I feel it, but to me it's a motivator. If I don't get in the gym and start pushing myself hard soon enough I'll just keep feeling them. They give a sensation of excitement and just add to the overall pre-workout experience. This is always my go to and fall back PWO and I'd recommend it to anybody.\n",
      "Does the NEW C4 live up to the hype?! I would say it is not hype, but the improvements made to the formula are certainly noticeable. This isn’t a NEW product in the sense that it is a completely new product in terms of formula, taste, effect, rather, it is an IMPROVED product than its predecessor. Personally, I would need more time to really test the boundaries of my “tolerance” to the product in order to assess the effectiveness of the TeaCor that was added to the formula. I LOVED the sustained energy that it gave me, the flavor and taste that quenched me, and the pumps that were very much felt with every workout. The new strawberry kiwi flavor is off the charts! Reminds me of some kind of candy I have had before; my new favorite flavor!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great explosive energy and it really feels true to its name. It didn't provide me much in the endurance aspect, however, and it also made me pee like crazy. I've only tried Green Apple so far and this flavor is on point!\n",
      "Man was the Strawberry Kiwi amazing. This has to be the best one I have tried. If anyone is wanting to get a great tasting C4 this one has to be on your list. Cellucor nailed the flavor\n",
      "I thought C4 is a good option compared to other pres. It was at a better price for me too compared to other pres. The only bad side was if you are taking pres before or another similar brand of them then you may need more than the recommended scoop to get a good feeling going. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've always been a big fan of C4. Great flavor, great ingredient profile, and relatively low stim. It's always the one I s****est for people when they don't really know what they're looking for.\n",
      "Love the green apple flavour.  Good pre workout but I have stopped using them daily.  Maybe once a week now because I work out at night.  \n",
      "Been a year or more since I've tried c4. Decided to give it a go again. The flavor isn't like I remember it. Definitely not as good as it used to be. I get some kind of gum tasting aftertaste. \n",
      "  I don't think the new blend has that same energy feeling like the old one. It's not bad but I have definitely tried better. Wish I got a different flavor that's for sure. \n",
      "C4 is my go to pre workout and green apple is definitely my flavor of choice. Some preworkouts taste like cough medicine so u just gotta down then, with c4 i enjoy every sip as its very smooth. The green apple taste just like a jolly rancher\n",
      "Best pre workout that I have encountered, I've been using it for 2 years (cycling on and off appropriately) and I have found no side effects whatsoever. Excellent product!!\n",
      "I have used Cellucor pre-workouts for the last few years, and, until now, I have been very pleased with the results.  Taste rating for Green Apple: 10.  Taste rating for Orange Dreamsicle: 5.  Previous generations of c4 have been stronger, and providing a different type of feeling and energy.  They literally had an \"I want to work out NOW!\" quality to them, leaving me with a good feeling before, during, and after my workout.  Not any more.  Now I feel like there is an underlying energy, but nothing that motivates me in the gym, especially when I am lacking in motivation already.  Too bad really.  c4 (previous generations along with NO extreme) used to be better than great product. \n",
      "Best pre-workout I have tried yet. Love the early morning boost. After a week you learn how much your body can handle. For me, I learned a scoop and a pinch is perfect. 1 heavy scoop gets you super pumped. 2 scoops provides a tingle. Fruit Punch tastes great. \n",
      "Best pre workout ever . it gives u the pump u expect. Price is good not like jym prework out although jym is amazing but its a bit expensive and only 20 serving. The only thing about it that after three mo th use u will stop getting the same effect so i tend to rest a week and reuse it again\n",
      "I have used C4 alot in the past and its definitely a good preworkout and all the flavors are pretty good. I absolutely love the green apple and I cant wait to try some of the new cellucer preworkouts \n",
      "I use to really like this supplement.  It was a great tasting preworkout that included creatine and a healthy dose of caffeine.  Recently this supplement changed!  From an ingredient stand point it is very similar to the old version but the taste has changed drastically!  It really tastes nasty, like very chemical like!  Maybe the other flavors are better but I wouldn't bet on it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Will always use C4. No jitters. Only Pump and Energy needed to do that 1 rep Max\n",
      "\n",
      "First time trying preworkout\n",
      "Not a fan of pink lemonade, looking to try something different next time - the after taste is not good, i feel like I'm choking it down.\n",
      "I get a slight tingly feeling the first five-15 minutes and it goes away, and I cannot quite tell if it helps my energy throughout a workout yet. Will need to test that out more! \n",
      "Best pre-workout! All the flavors except mojito were wonderful! After trying to use it a couple of times, I just gave the mojito tub away. Watermelon is by far the best flavor in my opinion! Almost as good as a jolly rancher. \n",
      "Hands down the best PW out there. Every person I've recommended this to has loved it. It will get you going. If you are new to this, I recommend only one scoop. Two will make you jittery and start to itch. Like anything else, if you keep taking this for a while, it will start to lose it's effect. After a year of taking it almost everyday, it had the opposite effect and I started getting tired and struggling with energy and sleepy in the gym. But again, as far as what's on the market, I'll pick this one every time.  \n",
      "As a past user of C4 I learn two things from my recent purchase.  1) the C4 formula has changed. Cellucor has reduced the niacin level. Personally, I favor the \"tingling\" niacin gives as it lets me know when C4 is in my bloodstream.  \n",
      "2) The original orange flavor was no longer available so I thought the orange dreamsicle flavor would be the closest compromise.  I was wrong.  Though it smelled like orange dreamsicle, it tasted like the way vomit smells (seriously).  I don't recommend this flavor!\n",
      "Great stuff, really gives me a boost for a intense workout\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, I have tried A LOT of pre workouts... I like to switch them up often.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all this is the smoothest, best tasting pre workout drink I've ever tasted, it's freakin' delicious. BUT personally, I needed to take 2-3 scoops of this feel much effect from it (& I'm only 5.7\", 150lbs). At 2-3 scoops it's just very economical for me. **UPDATE**  About halfway through my container I found C4 put me in quite a depressive state of mind when I would take it, and not motivated at all to actually workout. So that may be a note of caution for some. \n",
      "\n",
      "To this day I haven't found a pre-workout as effective as Craze (The old formula), classic craze's scoop was smaller, but got you jacked & in the mood to try to stop a moving train. \n",
      "\n",
      "7/10\n",
      "Excellent taste and pumps me up in the AM for my morning WOD.  \n",
      "Great job Cellucor!\n",
      "I got C4 as a gift. Absolutely ordinary pre-workout. Has nothing in it but beta-alanin, caffeine, creatine (only 1 gram) and Arginine (only 1 gram again). Even with 2 scoops this product is obviously really weak and every supplement user who knows at least a little bit about substances and pre-workouts must see that this is not worth of price. People are sheeps. They follow. Don't be one of them and use your own brain!\n",
      "This is a great product and I've used it for the past year (off and on). But, I think the packaging should be better. The first time I ordered this product, I ordered 2. The first one solidified pretty quickly, and when I went to unwrap and open the container, it was already a solid. If the product (container) wasn't affected by humid weather, I'd definitely rate this product a 10.\n",
      "I'm a lemonade addict, but the Strawberry Margarita beats the Pink Lemonade by a landslide when it comes to taste, but I also love sweet things, so those of you who don't might want to try another one. It does its job, no complaints, but \"explosive\" energy is not how I would describe it. It's steady, if not on the weak side. Those of you more used to preworkout than me will probably need more than one scoop.\n",
      "Best pre-workout energy I've found. Surprises me every time.\n",
      "Seems to do what it's supposed to. I'm pretty new to the gym but it definitely gets me tingly if I don't start doing something by about the 20-25 minute mark after consumption. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the strawberry margarita flavor and I'll just say that if it were kool-aid I'd have a big cup or two, tastes great.\n",
      "I love this pre-workout, give me the pump I need for my workout and taste is amazing.\n",
      "Finally I tried C4 and I was pretty impressed...it's definitely a solid pre-workout that gets you going when you need it to...Blue Razz is very good as well.  I will still be on the lookout to see if there is anything better on the market however, but if not I'll be back for more C4 or the new C4 Ripped.\n",
      "Did not find this product helped ME, much at all. Even once tried taking double the amount, but to no extra benefit. \n",
      "Have started taking a different pre workout, which is soooooo much better.\n",
      "Will write a review about it after I have finished.\n",
      "I loved this pre workout! Didn't get jittery but I was able to lift heavier and for longer periods of time. The flavor of the strawberry margarita took me a little bit to get used to it but it was great! \n",
      "Intense bump up :)\n",
      "got high off it. It did a medicore pump. The product was used up waaaaay to quick. Go spend your hard earned money on JYM Pre-JYM, or Kage Muscle Pre-Kaged. If pre-workouts are placebos then the better placebos are pre-jym and pre kaged. \n",
      "The flavor is great, yet it doesn't give the energy that one expects! This is the third period of time I buy C4 to test out their new ingredients, but it still is weak and fails put out! \n",
      "\n",
      "This gives me the pump I need for a great workout every time also bodybuilding.com has a very fast shipping and its 100 times better then overpriced retailers. I will be ordering from them from now on. \n",
      "I usually take 2 scoops around 10-15 minutes before my workout and the pump is fantastic, I have built somewhat of a tolerance for the preworkout but I still get the tingly feeling and always feel pumped before lifting. Has me sweating more than normal as well, overll an amazing product and the icy blue razz is a nice flavour, not too sweet either.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using the same preworkout for almost 2 years now, occasional breaks in between.\n",
      "The best pre workout I have used hands down. I have tried other brands, but nothing compares to C4 - The blue razz is the best flavour - The fruit punch is a little sweet for me. Gives great energy. This is always in my cupboard. \n",
      "So let me start off by saying i'm a HUGE cellucor fan, & an avid C4 user. However, the new formula of C4 does absolutely nothing for me. I even weened myself off for over a month between my last batch (which was the old formula) and my new one. So the fact that i had to use 2 & a half scoops and still feel nothing makes me really disappointed. I bought strawberry margarita & fruit punch. I figured it was maybe the flavor but nope, both had no effect on me.\n",
      "C4 is definitely effective in providing a quick energy boost for my workouts. After long days of classes and working in a lab, it provides a nice mental jolt to my usually fried brain. I take it about 15 minutes before my workout, at this point 2 scoops with water (I built up a tolerance pretty quickly, even though it's my only source of caffeine). However, I can't say that it gets me through my workouts. It does the job in getting me in the mindset for the gym, but usually once I'm there it's effects have mostly worn off. For that reason, I'll give it a 7; it does what I bought it for, but nothing more. I may try a different pre workout next, or just stay away from them altogether.\n",
      "This has been my go to pre workout.  I tried to make the switch to no xplode and that didn't work for me.  I must say that I do have to take almost two scoops to get my pump, but that is still within the recommended guidelines.   Like everybody else, there are days in which I don't have the energy to go to the gym.  Taking c4 helps with that feeling and gets my butt up.\n",
      "Amazing. Tastes awesome, mixes well, and does what it's expected to. Repeat buyer and love this product. \n",
      "This is my go to preworkout, the standard which I compare all others to. If I'm going to suggest a preworkout to a first time user I send them to C4. It gives me a good amount of energy and focus that lasts through most of my workout, maybe and hour to an hour and a half. It makes me a little jittery at first, but it's not nearly as bad as some others I've taken. I have to take 2 scoops of C4 to get the desired effect I want. Overall very pleased with C4, blue razz in particular. \n",
      "First time buying this product and it works great. I don't get any crash at the end, and one of things that i think is most important is that i did not get any jitters after consuming this product. Strongly recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best tasting and best preworkout out there!  I love the Niacin, and Beta Alanine flush, and effects!!!  I can tell a difference when I do cardio, as well as assistance with the all-important last few/extra reps!\n",
      "As a first-time user, I thought C4 worked very well. I did not think the recommended serving was too intense or anything like that. Definitly got in a few more reps and made some gains! Pink Lemonade is pretty good!\n",
      "Best tasting pre-workout drink I've had yet (Icy Blue Razz flavor), which is why I keep coming back.  It's not the most potent, kick-in-the-pants type of drink, but 1.5 scoops does help me get through workouts with focus.  No jitters, no crashes either.  Wouldn't mind if it was a little bit stronger.\n",
      "I was pleased with this product, first couple sessions with this was good, wasn't getting the pumps I thought I would, now I have to take almost two scoops to get a good pump and sustained workout focus / energy. the ba itch is enough for meand once I start hitting the weights it really kicks in I was able to push a couple more reps out on each set, I would buy this again and will cycle this in and out with Pre-gro.\n",
      "It does what its made for! It helps you get ready for working out. It gives you energy to get through the workouts and if you get the right flavor it tastes great.  In my opinion the watermelon is the best. You can't go wrong with fruit punch either. Stay away from the Orange dreamsicle and the pineapple.\n",
      "I take this product at least half an hour before work out. It does not give me the jitters as with Jack 3D and I get to push through my work out with lots of energy. I definitely recommend this product. \n",
      "At first was a little skeptical of buying this based off of some of the reviews, which were negative. First off, I will say that I have tried the Jacked 3D which came out 4 years ago when I first started weight training in HS and remember how much energy that stuff gave me which was, TOO MUCH! I will say that C4 works great! It is a very balanced product which gives me plenty of energy without a ton of caffeine and sugar, which isn't good for you at all. I took two scoops and I felt like Superman, it gave me tons of strength and energy to kill my workout. I believe that this product is good for burning fat as well. Regardless of what people say about it, it really works great for me! It also tastes AMAZING where as JACKED 3D tastes like a bunch of chemicals.\n",
      "I have to admit I was sceptical when the new 4th gen came out ..... I was in love with the 3rd gen. but the new formula is fantastic !! 2 scoops definitely needed for max stim power , I throw one scoop into my mouth, chase it with water ( the flavor is awesomely potent that way ) then 10-15min later throw down the 2nd scoop then ZING it's doing something , anything time !! workouts are definitely longer and more intense and trail runs more powerful. combine this product with a phat shaker full of Alpha Aminos and you've got an amazing pump and endurance ahead of you !!! the veins in my shoulders bust out with this combo. definitely my favorite pre-workout by far !!!\n",
      "C4 was the first pre-workout I have ever tried, because I've always heard good reviews. I bought the watermelon flavor at first. I couldn't stand to drink it.. SOOOOO sweet! However, I did purchase the pink lemonade and that didn't taste too terrible. But I didn't really feel an energy kick from this preworkout. I switched brands. \n",
      "Don't know if it was just me but it  was a waste of money. Could work better if you stacked if with some other pre workout \n",
      "Decent pre-workout, but lost it's effectiveness after a few weeks. No issues with shakes or trembles though, the energy was definitely good energy.\n",
      "This product has changed my life. Best taste and best results I've ever had. Both flavors taste great, but the orange just doesn't give me quite the same rush as the icy blue razz. Nonetheless a great product. \n",
      "Best tasting pre-workout i have ever had. No after taste like some other pre-workouts. Get me going for my workout which usually takes place after a 12 to 13 hour day of work. \n",
      "My friend convinced me to break from my normal fruit punch to strawberry margarita and I literally wish everything I drank tasted the way it does! I had no troubles getting it to dissolve, as  I never have. And yes it does make your skin tingle if it works effectively for the user but nothing like pins stabbing me. Definitely gets me going at the gym\n",
      "Been using C4 as my preworkout of choice for about two years, honestly. Have always loved it. Had great energy, love the tingle in my face, great stamina, all that stuff. But once I got my hands on the new formula, I really felt a downgrade in the product. Not sure what it was. Maybe less stimulants, maybe my tolerance went up, but I don't think it's a coincidence that as soon as the new bottle came out, the effectiveness went down for me. I even gave my gf a scoop and 1/2 of the new C4 (she's never taken a pre-workout, but drinks coffee a lot) and she said she literally didn't feel a thing. \n",
      "Been trying new preworkouts now, have used DyNo by RSP and ENGN by EVLution and both have been WAY better than C4 in my opinion. \n",
      "\n",
      "C4 to ya door, no beef no more. \n",
      "c4 does all that it promises, it gave me a lot of energy and i experienced much less fatigue. (and less importantly, i had a nice pump) also, It tasted pretty good and had great mixability, (barely had to shake it.)  overall this is a great product and i would highly recommend trying it.\n",
      "This stuff is AWESOME. A ton of energy that keeps me going throughout my entire workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upgrading from my typical Dunkin Donuts hazelnut iced coffee to this was an awesome choice. This is a great pre workout I would recommend to anyone who needs a little extra oomph and energy before their workout. The pink lemonade was yummy! I can't wait to try the strawberry margarita. \n",
      "\n",
      "LOVE C4 and have used it for about 2 years. I have to say that the new formula has definitely messed with the flavors. I religiously use the Pink Lemonade and Watermelon and just got the new versions last week. It almost has that weird \"diet soda\" taste vs. the original Jolly Rancher taste. I'm very disappointed that they changed it. The pump feels the same but I miss the old taste.  Don't get me wrong - it's still better than any other PWO on the market.\n",
      "Best pre-workout I have found so far. The pink lemonade flavor is amazing. C4 brought the pump and focus to help push myself harder during my workout. \n",
      "Edit: Extremely disappointed with the orange dreamsicle flavor. You soiled it. Soiled it! Regardless, still one of the best preworkouts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good product! I dont get the same pump as when I first started using this, but its still there. Pink lemonade is my favorite flavor and strawberry margarita was my least favorite. The mixeability was overall good with the exception of the grainy part left in the bottom, its still not anything detrimental. Overall great and a definite \"Buy Again\" product.\n",
      "I recently purchased Cellucor's C4 pre-workout in the Pink Lemonade flavor. I like the flavor a lot and how it mixes. I get a great pump from taking it as well. One thing I have noticed is I don't get that adrenaline rush-type feeling I get when taking other pre-workouts, which isn't always a bad thing. I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to others. I am hoping to try the C4 ripped next!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first preworkout I have ever purchased or tried. I LOVE it! the flavor is something like crystal light pink lemonade. I noticed an immediate improvement in my workouts - I lifted heavier on more exercises for a longer workout!  This will be essential to my workouts in the next coming weeks\n",
      "On the jar is says that harmless tingling might occur.... it felt like bee stings all over my face, hands, and feet.... pretty intense... it doesnt happen every time which is nice but even with that said this product is amazing if your looking for energy. It is like crack in a jar. When using before my workouts I'm able to last longer and accomplish what I need to. I love this product and the watermelon is to die for!\n",
      "This helped me to give more to my work out.  Also, the flavor was actually really good!  \n",
      "I've tried plenty of PWO's over the years and I've always come back to Cellucor C4 because of it's great taste, it quality ingredients and the clean, consistent energy that I feel after taking it. \n",
      "The flavor was great and I felt pretty good while using this product.  I prefer the C4 Extreme though.\n",
      "i didn't notice much difference while i lift............. the taste of watermelon is acceptable \n",
      "Flavor wasn't great but I loved the tingly feeling it gave me. It got me pumped up! The downside is that it contains creative. I would go with a pre-workout without creatine next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've used C4 on two different training cycles and this is a great pre-workout.  I only use 1 scoop and can notice better neural stimulation from the caffeine.  I like being able to use a creatine supplement that doesn't have a loading phase.  Many of my friends use 2-3 scoops.  When I've tried 2 scoops I ended up with a headache later in the day.  \n",
      "I was using Muscletech's Neurocore for a long time. I liked it because I could take it late at night and workout and still be able to sleep after. Not long ago I ran out and needed more, went to the store and they were all out, ordered up some C4.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've almost used up a 30 serving. I love this stuff. I get more of a boost from C4 than Neurocore. I like that it has more creatine. It doesn't really matter to me about the itch, but if it does to you, I get little to no itch with C4 compared to Neurocore. With Neurocore it feels like I'm squeezing needles out of my pores haha.\n",
      "This was my first time using any cellucor product and the pre-workout is pretty popular so I had to try it. I received the supplement in a timely manner so that was awesome! I took it 30 min prior to working out and the flavor was very strong and it was not nasty just not what I was expecting. I about 10 min after taking it I felt extremely pumped and energized/ slightly itchy. It lasted for a good 45 min to 1 hour into my workout and was satisfied with the results. However, next time I would probably try and different flavor. \n",
      "Pink lemonade tastes like crap, do not even try to taste it. Blue raspberry is okay, just mix with a couple more ounces of water because it is really sweet. Fruit punch is my favorite, also mix with a couple more ounces of water. C4 gives a great pump and energy flow throughout the workout. \n",
      "Tastes great, but something in it made me itch. And it was not pleasant. Probably won't order again until they reformulate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first pre workout ever and to make it short it was crap. It did not deliver anything. No pump, no extra energy, no focus and not even the beta alanine tingling that usually people dislike. The flavor tastes exactly like a regular pink lemonade so nothing too special about it. Overall, I wont buy this again and wont recommend it to anyone unless you take at least 2 scoops\n",
      "It's my first time trying a pre-workout product so I don't know much about other stuff, but this one work. I only take 1/2 serving and skip breakfast to try out (I do my lifting in the morning) and end up having too much force that I can't believe myself.\n",
      "Probably my favorite pre-workout out there. Great stimulants, and good ratios. Cellucor always has great pre-workouts and the new generation are just as good. Easy to mix, starts to kick in about 15-20 minutes after taking it. don't really notice a crash unless you exceed 2 hours of hard lifting.\n",
      "I've used several of the C4 flavors.  They aren't my favorite in flavor but one of my favorites for performance.  They never fail to get me pumped for my workout.  Never jittery but can definitely feel the tingle and blood flow with great pump after a serious workout.  There will always be a canister in my cupboard.\n",
      "I'm on the fence with pre-workouts, to be honest. In any case, it's nice to have something tasty to drink, before hitting the gym in the morning. I'm not sure if the other ingredients (besides caffeine) really do much, but I figure they can't hurt. I just wanted to review this product because I LOVE the flavor- it really does taste like orange dreamsicle, and I appreciate the fact that companies have moved beyond cherry, grape, and orange. I'm looking forward to trying the strawberry margarita flavor that I also ordered :) \n",
      "This product is AWESOME for a kick in the pants energy boost.  Our workout time is after a long day of dealing with teenagers (both high school teachers), and by the time we hit the gym our kids have drained the energy about as low as it can go both mentally and physically.  When we first looked at purchasing C4, we were warned that it was too strong for females...  so we went with a lesser product.  That product did not give us the boost we needed.  Once we tried C4, we were hooked.  It gives us the first RUSH that we need to get going, and stays strong through a full two-hour workout.  The best flavor is the \"Sweat Tea\", but I think it has been discontinued.\n",
      "Flavors are great, but overall formula is merely just another Pre workout, typical 150 mg of caffeine, 1.6 g beta alanine.  Nothing new or revolutionary but not a bad product, I only get if I get a protein stack and it's basically free, prob wouldn't buy myself but not bad either.\n",
      "I had never used a pre-workout before but this one came recommended and I certainly had a good experience with it.  I felt some light tingling but it wasn't bad and otherwise it felt like it provided a clean, non-jittery boost to my energy and focus.  Definitely helped get me over the hump on days when I really didn't feel like working out.  I felt like it helped give some better pumps and overall workout performance, too.  There were a few days where I took C4 but still felt pretty tired at the gym, but they were few and far between.  Pink Lemonade flavor tasted better than I expected.\n",
      "As the first pre-workout that I tried, it was a little much at first. I definitely feel the energy but the 'tingly' feeling can be a bit much. Overall it's a good product but may be not for me since I'm just starting out.\n",
      "I have used C4 for a while.  I have always been satisfied with the results, but the flavors were sometimes a little hard to swallow (for me).  Strawberry Margarita changes all of that.  It is delicious.  I have a new favorite flavor.\n",
      "Gives me the energy and focus for every rep. Keeps me going & inhibits fatigue. \n",
      "OH my word!  The Orange Dreamsicle is awesome!  I am still only using one scoop for the push and it gives me tingles usually in my legs and head (weirdly enough).   I definitely would recommend this prework for the extra energy to push out the last couple of reps.  My weight and rep count went up about one step within a week of using it (i.e. 40lbs dumbbell shoulder presses turned into 45lbs dumbbell shoulder presses).  Great product!\n",
      "\n",
      "Very Excellent taste! The Mystery flavor is very tasty.\n",
      "i put 2 scoops and i felt like a superman :)\n",
      "gave me awesome pump!!\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the new C4, with the taste of Orange Dreamsicle!\n",
      "Taste is good, it gave me an amazing PUMP! this is like magic!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I Recommend This Product On Whoever Is Looking For A Pre-Workout! It Takes 15 Minutes To Actually Feel It Working! With This Product I Honestly Can Stay At The Gym For About 2-2.5 Hours And If I Don't Take It, I Usually Last About An Hour. I Really Love The Watermelon Flavor (10 Out Of 10). Also I Bought The Strawberry Margarita And It Tastes Okay But Not Bad (8 Out Of 10).\n",
      "Watermelon flavor is awesome. Tastes like a watermelon jolly rancher melted down into a drink and yet the product doesn't have a ton of sugar, awesome!\n",
      "Gives a great boost of energy even on the worst of days where I don't get enough sleep and have worked far too long.\n",
      "If I get close to a scoop and a half in a serving I start to tingle/itch which doesn't bother me honestly because it lets me know it's working and it just pumps me up. I don't really get the jitters at all with this product.\n",
      "I would like to get some of the benefits I feel by taking a scoop and a half by only taking a scoop but it may be due to my prolonged use of pre-workout supplements for the last 10 years.\n",
      "Great product overall.\n",
      "C4 aka Consistently awesome. This stuff just works for me...better than what coffee does for me. I only need one scoop and within 10-15 minutes I find the drive after a long day of work to go work hard in the gym. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I like the fact it doesn't have a ridiculous amount of caffeine in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope this helps! \n",
      "Excellent Pre-Workout...nice energy boost and a little tingling starts right about 15minutes after taking.\n",
      "Absolutely delicious but shortly after taking for just a few days, it lost its affect and I was basically just drinking sparkling crystal lite \n",
      "The new G4 is a solid Replacement.. with the edition of some new ingredients Added TeaCor™  the latest innovation in energy. ‘ Hits   like the first time, every time.\n",
      "Just wanted to rate orange dreamsicle as it does not deserver a 9 in taste. It taste terrible.\n",
      "I have tried different pre-workouts over the last couple years and I really like C4.  The new strawberry margarita flavor is really good.  It mixes well with the recommended amount of water, you don't have to worry about the last two drinks being half undissolved powder.  It is a nice clean energy and I don't have a crash from it.  I will buy this one again.\n",
      "Like most pre-workouts this is a hit or miss both in flavor and overall boost. I had no side effects from this product, but after taking it a few times, it's effect grew rather weak. Fruit Punch tastes AMAZING, Blue Razz isn't bad at all. Over-all its a good brand/product, but there are more potent preworkouts available.\n",
      "This was my very first preworkout, probably the 3rd or 4th generation of it. This was many years ago, I did not build resistance to preworkouts as quickly as I do now and I always remember it giving me the most insane pumps. Even on days where I had early morning practices and my diet was not being monitored I could still take it in the evening and get a monster workout out of it. Fast forward to last year and it was still working its charm, the formula must have changed because it definitely was not as crazy. This past Fall I gave it a shot again in a Cellucor stack, and it really failed me. About 12 servings into it and I had to jump to 1.5 scoops, and eventually 2. I was building resistance to it, and this was after months of not using preworkout. I have yet to try the 5th generation formula mostly because I just don't trust it right now. I don't want to spend money and be disappointed to finish it within 3 weeks. Flavor wise I've always had the Blue Razz, I enjoy the taste but would love to try some of the new flavors. All in all this is my second least favorite preworkout and I do not plan on buying it in the near future.\n",
      "Flavors are good. No bad side effect when doubling the dosage. It does not give you much energy or focus compared to the last generation C4. Because of this I order the C4 extreme off of Amazon. I wish bodybuilding.com still offered the last generation on here. The change of some of the ingredients left it less potent..... There are better pre-workouts. My wife does take this though, and she is really sensitive to caffine and loves the products. She only takes it for focus and energy because she is a 1st grade teacher and loves to teach on her feet. She only takes 1/2 scooper to 3/4 and thinks it is perfect. She also prefers the older generation though.\n",
      "\n",
      "It worked really well for a few weeks but then I built up a tolerance pretty quick. My recommendation is to use it until three scoops isn't enough and then either take a few months off, or switch to a non beta-alanine preworkout until that runs its course.\n",
      "Excellent pre-workout drink! It gives me the mental focus and energy that I am looking for, the harder I work the harder it works!  I switched to C4 from Black Powder and love it!\n",
      "Tastes good and mixes well.  I don't get the pump I do with other pre-workouts and it just feels like I'm taking a lot of caffeine.  I got a good boost of energy for about a half hour followed by a big crash.  This is a pretty cheap PWO but I feel you get what you pay for.  I won't be buying this again.\n",
      "I mixed 2 scoops of fruit punch gen 4 c4 with 16 oz water on lifting days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixibility: I feel as though with previous generations of c4 some product would always clump at the bottom of my shaker cup. This new formulation is a much finer powder and mixed up perfectly in a glass with a spoon, no shaker needed\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste:In previous versions of c4 they have always tasted great to me, a little on the sweet side and most were pretty tart. Fruit punch tastes sweet, minus the usual tart. I like to mix some extra water and enjoy sipping on it once my workout begins since it tastes so good. Almost identical to fruit punch Hi-c\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy & Focus: This product has always given me tremendous energy & focus. I was skeptical that a better formula could be mad\n",
      "I have to train at 5:30am and with this stuff I get an energized and focussed workout in no matter how I'm feeling beforehand.\n",
      "If I was a beginner and had never had another per workout this would be a good product, but having said that I have since tried multiple others. C4 will not be re purchased. After a week or two I felt close to zero effects even when I went  on from one scoop to two. The taste was really good but, I think I will stick with my other options.\n",
      "\n",
      "As always the taste of the C4 was on point, Cellucor never fails to deliver when it comes to taste factor and how well it mixes, I take mine with a little OJ to keep my glucose levels a little higher during training.  However thats where the fun ended for me with the new formula.  I don't  feel like I am getting the same kick as I did with the previous C4, Almost like they watered this one down (even the scoop size is a lot larger than previous) to promote their c4 50x or something.  Sadly I will be finding a new PWO as for my left over containers I will be giving them to my friends who are more stim sensitive because I can feel almost nothing when I take this.  I don't think they had to fix what wasn't broken.\n",
      "I've used my fair share of different kinds of pre-workout, Cellucor c4 was on a level of its own. It doesn't take very long to take effect and lasts a while, the flavors are great and not overpowering. I started using this when my brother came home for leave from the marines, and have been loyal since, and I would happily recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "took this product for 4 weeks during workouts,first few weeks it was all good, felt the tingles\n",
      "and now after awhile i feel nothing. leaves me wondering where the kick went to and if its coming back? i got 3 tubs of it . it is just juice powder now???\n",
      "Ever since the new formula it has been really easy for the focus and energy to wear off after a few days. After five days of taking it I can't feel a single burst of energy/focus which sucks because I have an extra tub that I haven't even used yet..\n",
      "Awesomee!!!!\n",
      "New product is delicious -definitely a fan of the new line. Flavor is gtg. \n",
      "Tastes great, new formula works BETTER than the old one but still isn't the most effective pre workout out there. Probably the most tasty, however. \n",
      "This did seem to help increase my energy during my workout, but it also made me itch very bad the first few weeks. \n",
      "This product gives great energy! The Creatine Nitrate is fast absorbing and better than monohydrate in my opinion. The Arginine gives a nice pump but I do supplement with an additional gram. You can feel the beta Alanine working with the slight tingling sensation which occurs shortly after taking. This is the first preworkout I have ever taken. I tried a few others since starting C4 to compare and I am confident it is the best of all of them! \n",
      "This is definitely a decent preworkout supplement, but still leaves a bit to be desired.  I definitely feel the \"tingle\" that they mention on the label, and it's not a bad feeling at all.  The pumps aren't bad, but could be better.  As far as energy, it could be better, but I stack with a caffeine pill which is dirt cheap, so that's not a big deal.  My main thing that I am searching for with this product is the focus.  I don't feel it as much as I had hoped for.  Stack this with glycergrow (which is also very cheap for it's performance) and your pumps will definitely improve.  I am really missing SuperPump 250, which was a beast on focus, pump, energy, and an additional benefit of giving \"everything\" a pump.  SuperPump Max fell short and I have just been looking for a suitable replacement for my workouts.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a good product, and better than most I have tried.  I would put it on par with Jack3d.  I will be trying a different product after I finish these.  Not to say that I won't be coming back though.  Taste is pretty good, mixability great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great flavor, great pre-workout. I recommend this.\n",
      "The old formula didn't work at all. The new formula kinda has a kick to it. I got a it for free so I'll use it but wouldn't buy it.\n",
      "Well, i get some energy after drinking it, but it's not that much energy... i'm taking 1 and a half scoop and i'm not so impressed. Overall it's a good product, but i don't know why this product has so much hype about it.\n",
      "Flavor was pretty good, but almost too much - kind of overpowering. I also didn't feel the effects as much as I have with other pre-workouts. Maybe I just need to take another scoop. \n",
      "The NEW 4th gen C4 is 2 times stronger than the previous 3rd gen. I liked the old C4, but i had to take 2 scoops to feel something. This time i took 2 scoops of a new C4, and i hit me in 10 minutes, i thought i'm gonna destroy my GYM. I had insane focus, power and pump ! It felt amazing, i couldn't stop lifting !  Man that new formula is amazing, i'd say best PWO supp i've ever tried, even better than the old Jack3D ! \n",
      "I've been taking c4 for a few weeks now and I've noticed a difference in my workouts. I know the beta-alanine kicks in because I can feel the tingle. I get a good pump during my workouts, and I'm able to push out another set or another rep than usual. There's a good amount of caffeine in here too, so after a long day of work, I'm still able to go at it. I give it a 9/10, because it does everything it says it will, but the difference doesn't impress me to the point of being a perfect 10/10. \n",
      "I love this product.  I was a big fan of the regular C4 to begin with so I was excited to try the new G4 C4.  I only used half a scoop (I'm very stim sensitive) and that worked out perfectly for me.  With gym sessions early in the am (5 or 6 depending on the day) I need all the help I can get-I am NOT a morning person and have a hard time crawling out of bed.  On gym days I skipped my coffee and went straight for the G4 C4.  I sipped it on the way to the gym (about a 30 min drive)  finished it up about halfway there and followed with water the rest of the drive.  It gave me enough of a push to get through my entire workout (about an hour) and 30-45 min cardio after, and was awake and in good spirits the rest of the day.  I didn't experience any type of crash at all-which is a huge selling point for me.  The energy I got from half a scoop was clean-no jitters, no nausea, and my focus was great.  I was able to push through some reps I normally really struggle with (I usually have to stop around 8 or 10 and take a breath or 2 to get to 12 or 15) and it felt good to be able to do that.  Mixability is great, no big chunks left in the bottom of the shaker cup only a few small ones but a good swirl made sure I got all the product in my belly!  Taste was off the chain-I LOVE the Pink lemonade.  I will definitely use this product again and I highly recommend it.  \n",
      "Great product great taste!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not one of those super chalky drinks. has a smooth taste and goes down easy. First couple of weeks I was using 1 scoop and that was sufficient. Had lots of muscle pump and seemed to be pretty focused. Then it seemed like I was getting used to the effect so I started using 2 scoop and the pump and focus is back. Been using it for about 2 months. \n",
      "Want an explosive kick to your workouts? Look no further than C4, this pre-workout supplement has some serious kick, and will help any athlete power through even the toughest session. Not only does it provide a noticeable boost in performance, but it lasts for quite a while as well, and winds down nicely with little of the 'crash' effect. If you need an energy boost, this is the product to put on your wish list. Pretty sweet, but not overpowering, and mixes pretty well too.\n",
      "As a loyal user of C4 I have always loved this pre-workout, taste and energy always on point, but with the new formula they have ruined the taste big time. The energy level in the gym is still as good as ever but I can no longer say I look forward to the taste like I used to. Please oh please change the flavor back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not like the taste for this pre workout at all but I found myself ch****ing it down because it worked. This new version of c4 has 150mg of caffeine per scoop which if you're a double scooper like me adds up to 300mg. 300mg of caffeine is amazing for people like that work and go to school full time, strong but won't give me jitters through my workout or for the rest of the day. Overall, this new c4 is amazing but I would not recommend the watermelon flavor. \n",
      "I would like to thank Cellucor for giving me the opportunity to try and review their product.  I've used C4 pre-workout for about 2 years now.  The new Generation 4 is better than ever!  I get the same 'pump' and focus but to me the biggest improvement is the way this product mixes.  Cellucor has always been my \"go-to\" company when it comes to taste, and when I didn't think it could get much better... Cellucor proved me wrong.  Having a good, well mixed product makes it just that much better.  Watermelon isn't my favorite, but the Generation 4 watermelon was amazing.  Thanks Cellucor for making an A+ product!\n",
      "\n",
      "First off I would like to say that I did not believe the best could get any better. Cellucor has raised the bar once again!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall quality of this products exceeds all expectations and in my opinion is the best pre workout on the market! \n",
      "\n",
      "Mix ability of this pre workout is great in that I only need 4 ounces of water per scoop which doesn't leave me full of water when I start my workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor of all C4 has always been extraordinary and the new G4 C4 lives up to the highly reputable Cellucor brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I am very pleased with every aspect of this product and will recommend it to everyone!\n",
      "Being a huge fan of C4, I was given the chance to review the new G4 series by the folks over at Cellucor. Taste-wise I think this flavor is good! (nothing outstanding though). I prefer the Icy Blue Razz. I really like the energy I get from about 1.5-2 scoops of this. The increased amount of caffeine and some other changes to their Energy Blend really helps me in the gym and studying afterwards! As a value, this stuff is pretty good! You can usually find it for a good price and usually there are a lot of deals going on with this company. I find that this product is best taken on an empty stomach about 1.5-2 hours before your workout. I think they've made great strides with this product and set the standard for pre-workouts. Worth a buy!\n",
      "The new G4 series C4 by Cellucor has taken my training to the next level! The new formula is amazing, it has a new punch to it and the pumps in the gym are more noticeable as the workout goes on! I really like how this new formula mixes very well, I use 6-8 oz. of water and within a minute the powder is dissolved. Very happy with the outcome of the product, Cellucor always has their customers in mind and makes top quality products. I would recommend the G4 Series line to anyone looking for supplements. \n",
      "Cellucor has taken a great product and made it even better. I received a bottle from Cellucor to try and review and, I must say, the new formula is a breath of fresh air.\n",
      "The new C4 retains all of the micro-molecules (Vitamin C, B-Vitamins, Calcium, etc) has an increased beta-alanine amount of 100mg and an entirely new, and more concise, energy blend. \n",
      "I've now taken C4 for about 2 weeks and I can say with certainty that I have felt no short-term or long-term adverse effects. C4 give a clean, noticeable increase in focus and endurance that many other pre's don't deliver on. I would highly recommend C4 to anyone looking to get serious about weight lifting and maximising workout potential.    \n",
      "If you're looking for a good kick start for the gym, C4 is definitely the way to go. I've been using C4 pretty consistently since 2012 and it gives me the energy I need to destroy my workout after a 12hr day at work.\n",
      "I got the Watermelon flavor of C4 and I loved it. It was one of my favorite flavors previously and all of their products taste fantastic, so I had no doubt it would still be great. It didn't disappoint. I mixed it for the first time after cycling off preworkout for 2 weeks. The pump and focus I had from C4 was awesome. It took about 15-20 minutes to kick in on an empty stomach. I began feeling tingling in my hands and feet. I also noticed an increase in vascularity while using the product and there was no insane crash where I felt weak. I really liked the updated formula! Will continue to use! \n",
      "I'd like to thank Cellular, and Cory for sending me this pre workout to review!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a fan of the old C4 but I could only use it maybe once a week, it just never hit me like other pre workouts did.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability: 10/10\n",
      "No left overs in the water bottle like some others I've tried, makes me feel good about the product knowing I'm absorbing everything that's in the product!\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: 10/10\n",
      "Let me start off by saying I absolutely HATE fruit punch flavor pre workouts, I've never had one that tasted like \"fruit punch\"!! When I saw the package I thought to myself great... 30 servings of fruit punch... lol\n",
      "100% better than any other fruit punch I've tasted, tastes like real fruit punch. Reminded me of my child hood which was kind of cool they could make something taste this amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy/Focus: 10/10\n",
      "I usually have a 20-30 min drive to the gym and have my pre workout ready in the car. 10 minutes on the way to the gym I actually feel the beta alanine working! The old C4 never made me feel like this. I've been growing more this month with this and pushing out more reps than ever before. 1-2 hour workouts? No problem, leg sessions I don't get tired anymore at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pumps/Vascularity: 10/10\n",
      "This is a big one for me since I've never gotten a real good pump from any pre workout, even Hemavol didn't do anything for me mixed with the old c4.\n",
      "Doing Bicep curls my veins are bigger and popping out like never before, I've never really dedicated days to doing just arms but this is kind of addicting...\n",
      "\n",
      "I've finished the whole tub of G4 C4 and absolutely love it, I went ahead and bought Blue Razz, Orange Dream and Strawberry Margarita. This new formula with TeaCor really works!! Never any crash after the workout from the caffeine and the pumps last hours after the gym. Thank you again for letting me test this product, nothing but good things to say about it.\n",
      "I just recently tried this because quite often when I don't have the energy after a long day at work I just don't workout. I took this and it gave me an incredible pump... its not instantaneous it takes about 20-30 minutes but it comes on slowly it doesnt just rush at me. and  it gives me a great energy boost. Only downside taken later at night it makes it harder for me to go to sleep. It needs to be made right before you take it or it won't have the same effect.\n",
      "Blue Razz is my favorite but Strawberry margarita is... ok to me. Green apple is the next flavor i'm trying. Green apple is my new go go flavor. I love it\n",
      "***UPDATE *** man I tasted the new c4 formula and man does it give me a pump. Pink lemonade is tasty too. I take it like a shot.\n",
      "I was taking C4 pink lemonade flavored for as long as I can remember. When I came across this new formula I was excited, and as soon as I took the icy blue razz flavor I was jaw dropped by how amazing the flavor and the effects it had on  my workout. So in a recap Just AMAZING\n",
      "If you’re a fan of C4 the G4 series will blow you away! As I say, consistency is key and with C4 consistency is what you get through and through. I’ve yet to build up a tolerance or haven’t even begun to feel that I’m building a tolerance and I’m a little over two weeks in and this makes me very happy. Obviously time will tell if TeaCor works as it’s supposed to but I’ve been using 1 scoop for the most part and haven’t felt the need to bump up to two yet. If I get in between 20-25 servings from the 30 serving tub it’s well worth the money in my opinion.  If I can consistently use 1 scoop it’s more than worth it to me! In my opinion C4 is a great pwo for beginning up to advanced lifters; it’s not overly heavy on the stimulants or too heavy in any other area that would scare off a first time user. Cellucor did a great job with the G4 C4 and I’m really happy with how it turned out as a consumer.\n",
      "Gives you that extra boost you need for a killer workout., with zero adverse effects. Great product and Great Service! I have tried a few different pre-work outs and hands down this one is my favourite.\n",
      "\n",
      "This review is based on G4. I was sent a 30 serving tub from cellucor to test out the new formula and see how I liked it. I will start off by saying I was very impressed, as usual. The increase in caffeine was just enough so that it wasn't making me crawl out of my skin, but you still feel that boost in energy that really lasts and helps you power through a tough workout. The Teacor is also a great additive to the new formula. I feel like it really added to the increase in energy compared to the older formula, and maybe the pumps as well because the pumps i get are skin tearing. It's awesome. As far as taste is concerned, same great taste as always; icy blue razz is the best. Over all: great boost, great pumps, great taste. Thanks guys!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the worderful opportunity to try the new C4 pre-workout thanks to Cory and the @cellucor crew\n",
      "\n",
      "I always mix my preworkout with 8oz of water in a shaker cup\n",
      "This product mixes extremely well and i have never experienced grains or clumps in my cup.\n",
      "The taste is ....WOW \n",
      "Its not to sweet and not to sour, its very satisfying to the sweet tooth\n",
      "My energy levels with the Cellucor C4 is always threw the roof, i always feel extra confident and excited to workout!\n",
      "My mind is more clear and focused on a better workout\n",
      "I enjoy that i dont get the jitters or a crash with this product and it pulls me all the way threw a great workout\n",
      "If your looking for a great tasteing, yet very affective preworkout...you will LOVE the new Cellucor C4 \n",
      "\n",
      "Huge shout-out to the folks @ cellucor for letting me try out the new C4 preworkout formula. Came home to a cellucor box on my doorstep with a FULL tub of C4 gen 4 watermelon to give a go!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've used the original C4 formula in the past and was my go-to for quite some time and enjoyed many, if not all the flavors. With that being said, I had high hopes in the flavoring and ingredients department and expected it to only get better with the generation 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability- 10/10 No problems here at all, no clumps or chalky taste. Have mixed with 8+ oz of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor profile- 11/10! *Watermelon* I would not say flavoring is a huge deal to me when using a product, although a nice addition if on point. This watermelon flavor was amazing, not too sweet & not too sour, juuuust right. This is an easy mixing flavor and whether you like a stronger or more watered down taste, it can easily suit to anyone's taste buds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredient Profile 8/10 The new C4 gen4 profile isn't too much different than the og formula, yet I still think its a solid profile and will give you the energy & focus when looking for a preworkout. The b-alanine is a tad underdosed and the nitrates are a nice added bonus. With 150mg of caffeine per scoop, this is a great dosing for someone who may be a bit stim sensitive, yet versatile that you can take 2 scoops and get a full dosing of all ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I have tried 1 scoop, 1.5 scoop, & 2 full scoop dosing. I am very pleased with everything about this product and have noticed a very clean energy boost, unbelieveable focus, and some nice pumps as well. My personal go-to is the 2 scoop as a preworkout with 300 mg of caffeine as my sweet spot. I would highly recommend this product to any lifter whether novice or experienced. Great job cellucor, a reputable company! \n",
      "I've been using C4 for over a year now. Tastes great and mixes really well with water. I haven't truly noticed a difference between the last generation vs the current generation but the pump is still the same for me. I've been doing 2 months on and 1 months off pre-workout. Definitely my go-to pre-workout. Shoutout to Cellucor for the samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean I loved it and all, got a good pump, focus and tastes the best out of any other pre work out. i felt as if mine were a little old when it arrived though as it was very clumpy and stuff. i would like to try to 60x soon.\n",
      "Amazing pre-workout, one of the only ones that has yet to actually give me a headache.\n",

      "This product is great! Mixes easy and has a great taste!! In my opinion c4 is the best preworkout for all your needs in the gym\n",
      "Thank you Cory and Cellucor for allowing me to test this product. I have been a fan of C4 for over a year now so I was very excited when I heard they were releasing a new formula. I wanted to test this product for a couple weeks to ensure consistency. I must say I am highly impressed with this new formula. It dissolved even better than the original C4, not grittiness left at the bottom of my shaker cup. The taste is wonderful, I tested the Fruit Punch flavor. What I like most about this product is the level of energy it gave me and how fast it worked. I could feel the product kicking in while I was still driving. My energy level was consistent throughout my workout. LOVE it!\n",
      "I just finished my first tub of the New C4 Formula and I was thoroughly impressed with the new formula.  I had the Icy Blue Razz flavor and it tastes just like the blue Popsicle we all grew up eating and loving.  My energy level were great throughout my workout or anytime I needed a pick me up at the office.  Pumps were great and I actually looked forward to drinking it each day.  Below are my ratings 1 to 10 on the areas most might find helpful.\n",

      "Overall I loved the new formula.  My only request would be a creatine-free version!  Thanks Cellucor! Keep up the Good work!\n",
      "-Nick B\n",
      "The old c4 formula was one of my favorite pre-workout but it was beginning to be less effective for me. Once I heard about the new formula I was super excited because I know Cellucor always comes out with quality supplements. I used to use 2-3 scoops of the original formula and still not feel much. I took a 1 month break from pwos and then I tried 1 scoop of the new formula and its crazy effective! I feel like the old formula used to hit you all at once with the energy but the new formula gets you progressively more focus throughout your work out. I never need to use more than 1 scoop now and it still works amazing for me!\n",
      "    I got this in today it is the new #cellucore #c4 #g4  pink lemonade pre workout I want to let you know I took one scoop and the mixability inside my cup within a few seconds everything was dissolved.the natural beet coloring was very light not very much color and has a very good the taste very close to the original pink lemonade. the effects of the product were very satisfying within the first 5 minutes I could feel the 1.6 grams of beta alanine and the 150 mg of caffeine per scoop was just right for me plus after my workout I was still very energized afterwards and it definitely helped me through my workouts this whole past week and I just want to give a huge shout out to the company @cellucore for giving me the free product to sample.\n",
      "This is now my best pre-workout supplement.  I have used MP Assault in the past (also a good choice), but C4 is explosive when it comes to getting that extra set in.  Blue Razz and Watermelon tastes excellent - very easy to drink.\n",
      "C4 lasts much longer in my workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I received a tub of the Gen 4 C4 to try for free from Cellucor. I was already looking forward to trying the new formula as C4 has always been my pre-workout of choice. I was sent the Fruit Punch flavor, it was my first time trying fruit punch as I usually used Strawberry Margarita in the previous gen C4. Fruit punch was very tasty and was very similar to the flavor of Hawaiian Punch. It wasn't too strong tasting though which was nice. I take my pre-workout about 30 mins before I start my sets. I only took one scoop to test the potency of the new formula. After about 20 mins I could feel my ears and hands tingling pretty strongly. I had plenty of sustained energy throughout my workout, instead of a just blast of energy at first.\n",
      "Really like this stuff. Taste is really good, especially the green apple. Only downside is I have to take a week or so off of it every couple months or I stop responding. \n",
      "\n",
      "My #1 prewokout love the effects,flavor,focus and energy this products gives.   Its a must try\n",
      "C-4 is by far the best product on the market at this time. The flavors are unbeatable and have no nasty aftertaste. Within a half an hour of taking this product you will get a surge of energy that will last completely through your workout. This product mixes extremely quickly and has no grit. After your first use of C-4 you will be dying to try all of the flavors on the market.\n",
      "Cellucor sent me the new G4 Series to try out and review! \n",
      "\n",
      "First off, TASTE: I received Pink Lemonade. Overall, it's not my favorite flavor so far from Cellucor. It doesn't really remind me of lemonade as its more sweet and not tart enough. I was expecting something like Crystal Light lemonade or something. If it had more of a \"bite\" like a good tart lemonade does, it would be A-Plus. While it is a good flavor, it is definitely not my fave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, MIXABILITY: Classic C4 mixability. No problems whatsoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, EFFECTIVENESS: I really didn't notice a huge difference between this new G4 series and the last version. That was...until yesterday. I don't know what I did, but my workout was insane. Much more than usual. Don't know if it was the C4 or if it was just my mental state. But if it was the C4...****!! \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, OVERALL: I love C4 and I love what it does for my workout. However, the only thing I'm marking down for was just the taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good job anyway Cellucor!\n",
      "This pre-work is very good! and recommend it to every one to try it out! gives me a good pump at the gym!! Makes me feel like a Beast!\n",
      "This stuff is unreal. My workouts have gone to a whole new level. It's like maricuru if u know what I mean. Total focus and Energy. Locked in. In a zone\n",
      "Cellucor sent me a free 30 serving jar to test out and review. I was happy because I had gone a couple of months without pre-workout and the last pre-workout I took was their last generation C-4. So this new generation is like the old C-4 but improved. It feels and looks more powdery. It still has a great taste and if you don't have a shaker or spoon then there's no need to worry since it mixes well by just shaking the bottle. After I'm done with my current pre-workout I'm buying this. \n",
      "Cellucor C4 is PWO of the year for 2013 and 2014 for a reason! And just when you think it couldn't get any better, they revamp the formula. Here's whats new;\n",
      "\n",
      "-Caffeine upped to 150mg from 135mg\n",
      "-TEA-COR: Structurally similar to caffeine but hits HARDER, stays LONGER, and has little to no tolerance build-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently went on a 3 month stim break and this stuff hits me good now! I'm cutting and just last week I hit a PR on almost every lift, and I'm cutting. Let's not forget about the pump either, it's absurd. I take my C4 right before I life and I mix 1 scoop in 8 oz of water. My favorite flavors are pineapple, green apple, and watermelon. I wouldn't be surprised if Cellular pulls a 3peat for PWO of the year\n",
      "I originally thought that C4 couldn't get any better but this new formula takes it to a whole new level! I had been using the old C4 for awhile and the new stuff took my workouts to an even higher level. I usually mixed 2 scoops with 12 oz. of water before weight training and 1 scoop with 6 oz. of water before cardio and both dosages provided a strong, sustained energy throughout my workouts. I didn't even bother dirtying a blender bottle with this, I just funneled it into a normal water bottle and shook it for ~10 seconds and it mixed perfectly. No grit, no powder at the bottom that you have to choke down, just smooth, delicious pink lemonade. I think the new formula's best part is the focus it provides. I was in the zone my whole workout \n",
      "I use this with my Army Physical Training in the morning to get the day started and once again in the afternoons. Great taste and easy to get down. following the instructions on the label and i have had no issues. I am taking 2 servings per workout/PT session and i have no problems getting in a solid 45-60 min work out and feeling/showing progress each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: While seeing results all over the board i have noticed the following. A bloated feeling car occur when you consume this all at one time quickly before a workout session. I would feel a flushed feeling after about 15-25 mins after taking the product. One big thing i have noticed with the product is if you like to do some intense running/sprints even drinking the recommended amount of water will cause cotton/dry mouth. Due to this i will be looking for a new product to try out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor was great!!!!  With 1.5 scoops, the energy is consistent throughout the workout.  Pumps/ vascularity was descent.  Overall, I would recommend!!!\n",
      "MIXABILITY = 10/10 - This was fairly straightforward. Tossed a scoop into about 8 oz of water and it mixed up perfectly. TASTE = 9/10 - The flavor with 8 oz. of water is the only reason I gave this a 9/10. I put a bit too much water in, but even so it held flavor pretty nicely. Creamy flavored(not textured) orange taste. Thoroughly enjoyed this. ENERGY = 8.5/10 - I'm used to bigger stim hits prior to working out (225-300), so I came in knowing that this would be a little bit smaller of a stimmed out energy than those would be. Steady and solid energy. PROFILE = 9/10 - Solid profile. Creatine nitrate, BA, solid caffeine amount and the L-Dopa for mood. Really enjoyed it. Felt calm but amped up during my workout. Pumps great too.\n",
      "I received a sample of C4 G4 Pink Lemonade from Cellucor.  This new formula is better than the old.  I normally would use 2 scoops of the old formula, but this time I tried one scoop with 10oz of water.  The pre-workout dissolved right away and there was no undissolved particles.  It took less than 20 minutes to kick in.  I noticed I was just as focused and energized with 1 scoop of the new formula vs. 2 scoops of the old.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking to try it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It has now been a week since I started using the 4th generation of C4. I've been very pleased with the older generation of this product and was anxious to see the difference. As always, the mixability of the product was great. Cellucor rarely has an issue with this. the taste of the Blue Raz is tolerable but not great. Sadly this seems to be the norm with most preworkouts. Already understanding my tolerance levels, I have been using two scoops for my workouts and have been very pleased with the energy and focus it gives me. It's with little difficulty going for a couple of hours in the gym and still feeling like going for one more.  As with many Cellucor products I feel that they have met the expectations that I have for this product. \n",
      "initial thoughts\n",
      " I always liked Cellucors labeling and packaging. Nice clean and intriguing look. Nothing over the top and not making HUGE false claims on the cover. For example saying theres \"x\" amount much creatine, then finding out its actually per 2 servings.\n",
      "\n",
      "flavor\n",
      " C4 has always been one of my favorite tasting Pre workouts. After drinking C4 it makes me wonder why so many other PREs taste like something you find under your kitchen sink. And the fourth gen Fruit punch is no different. \n",
      "\n",
      "Effects\n",
      " I'm a pretty stim tolerant person so I went with 1.5 scoops. Got those nice tingle feeling on my way to gym. Felt good through out my workout. Felt a bit increase in my stamina, actually added another exercise to end of my workout. Energy you get from taking this product is nice and clean. You shouldn't feel all jittery and want to run around like a wild man.\n",
      "\n",
      "overall\n",
      " So at the end of the day I would recommend this to anybody wanting a pre work out or anybody who enjoyed the last formula of C4. I used 2 full scoops of the formula but felt 1.5 of this product should be enough. If your not stim tolerant I would recommend just starting with 1 scoop or even half, if you havnt taken many pres before.\n",
      "\n",
      " Once again thanks for letting me try this product! Cellucor does not disappoint!! \n",
      "II got a tub of the New C4 G4 to try out thanks to Cellucor and it is quite the improvement over the last formula.  The new formula isnt drastically different but the right changes were made and the addition of Teacor apparently was another good choice. The effects of the new formula is much great than the last. More endurance, mental focus and the delay of lactic acid build up. The flavoring is still awesome. So for people that liked the last formula and or stim sensitive this is definitely worth a try. \n",
      "This preworkout tastes amazing. This is the first ever preworkout that I have taken. The first week that I took it I was flying off the handle with focus and intensity. However, I have been taking up to two scoops per workout and I feel almost nothing. Your body adjusts to this supplement very quickly. However, I do feel that it pushes me through those extra reps.\n",
      "Old faithful right here.  One of the best preworkouts around with some truly great flavoring.  Really easy to dose to your liking with the relatively transparent label, though of course full transparency is preferred.  Two to three scoops gives me nice pumps and great focus and a lot of people will probably need less.  C4 also has one of the best Fruit Punches and they absolutely nailed it with Mojito.  Looking forward to trying the other few flavors I haven't gotten my hands on yet!\n",
      "This stuff is great. I can be tired from a day of work, but after I drink this all I can say is wow. I'm ready to get focused and hit the gym. It mixes well and tastes great.\n",
      "Improved formula without a doubt in my mind. The tingle felt by Beta-Alanine is still present in the new formula, just not as extreme. This new formula, instead, gives a great tingle, amazing focus and the perfect amount of pump that one wants to achieve with every workout. The flavor  is spectacular. I have with me the Pink Lemonade version; its taste instantly reminded me of crystal light which is a delicious no-cal beverage commonly consumed by Mom's (lol)\n",
      "\n",
      "Where this pre-workout lacks is in its tolerance speed. After 5 consecutive workouts, you will notice the tingle start to fade more and more as expected when your body adjusts to a supp. The one positive to this is the fact the new formula takes longer to become less effective. Also, more nutrients could be added to this product, this is basically a stimulate pre-workout. The only benefit one gets from this product is the feeling of alertness, no actual benefit for muscle growth and recovery other than some creatine in it which does aid in recovery and growth. \n",
      "Before I start my review on this product, I would like to let everyone know that Cory and the Cellucor team reached out to me and gave me this gift to be able to try out the new formula of C4.  Knowing this, I will be as honest and upfront about my review as I can be.  I was very eager to try the new formula and thank you Cory and the Cellucor team for letting me have this opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability (10/10):  I have only used one scoop so far as I just reintroducted stimulated pre-workouts into my regime.  I used 6-8oz of water in my shaker.  As expected, and just like the last formula, it mixed very well without effort and there was no residue or grains at the bottom of my shaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste (10/10):  I have tried the original formula of Pink Lemonade and I believe this time they really nailed it.  I even forgot that for a moment that I was drinking this as a pre-workout and would even contemplate having this on a hot summer day with some ice.  Depending on how much water you use, you can have it watered down or more of a potent flavor.  I found 8 oz. of water to be the sweet spot but if you like it stronger, feel free to use less water and vice versa,  \n",
      "\n",
      "Energy and Focus (8/10):  I may not have given this category a 10 but by no means should this new formula of C4 be taken lightly.  It is still very potent and does a great job of getting you worked up for the gym.  I gave this an 8 because I have tried many different pre-workouts and there are some out there that deliver a much larger punch of caffeine per scoop such as 300 mg.  Now of course, if you are looking for a greater burst of energy, you can always have 2 scoops or try their new product C4 50X which is more potent.  The focus was on point and as expected by the Cellucor team.  The new ingredient Teacor felt great as I feel this formula does an even better job of keeping you focused and wanting more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stength (10/10):  This category is where I felt that this product greatly succeeded.  I have set a few personal records since being on this product and have felt that I have been able to lift heavier without compromising form.  I also have noticed higher reps with heavier sets as well.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Pumps (7/10):  The muscle pumps have been great but I haven't noticed much of a difference from other great pre-workouts.  I did feel more full and noticed a great tightening of my arms when lifting on arm day but I still feel that they could incorporate more ingredients that help give an even fuller and more potent pump.  I have had other products that do a good job of this and feel this formula could up it a bit in that category.  You could pair with with other products of theirs but I would also like to see it increased in this as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vascularity (10/10):  Vascularity has always come more naturally to me when it comes to lifting but I did still feel that this product did a great job of bringing out more veins on my arms and legs.  Of course, there are many factors that contribute to this but I would still agree that this product did nothing but help that process.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Formula (10/10):  When I first heard that Cellucor was releasing a new formula of C4, I was very excited to try it because C4 is what I started with a few years back.  During that time, I tried all of the flavors and swore by it for many months.  This formula does not disappoint and I feel that the up in caffeine and their new ingredient Teacor really gives you a great bang for your buck.  It may not give you an insane amount of energy like some products out there, but it does give you the right amount.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone is different and some people respond differently to different stimulants.  In saying that, I think that the new C4 formula really is great step up from their original great product and I can't wait to try other flavors and their more potent form of it as well.  The new G4 line looks great and this is something I would not pass up.  Cellucor has exceeded my expectations for this new formula and even though I think they could add a few other ingredients, it is still an amazing product and great for lifting or any person that is seeking an active lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my third time taking C4 and I think it's one of the top pre workouts out there. This is the only non MusclePharm product I will use. Every flavor I've had is amazing and it mixes very well. This gave me great energy to get though my early morn workouts and the pumps I have gotten are incredible. I love the ingredients in this product and will buy again!\n",
      "I've been using this new formula of C4 for a little over 2 weeks now, and has really done a great job for me. I have had no problems mixing this with a blender of bottle or with just a spoon and glass. Typically I use 1.5 scoops in around 6-16oz of water to play around with the taste. I am not a big fan of blue razz products in general, hence the lower rating, but it is one of the best I have tasted. The energy I had with this product was really nice, no fatigue half way through my workouts, and even gave me enough to hit some cardio after the weights. Now my favorite thing about this C4 was the pumps and vascularity. If you are a fan of super setting and drop sets during arm day, be ready for an insane pump. Brought out some veins I haven't seen in a while which was also really nice. My focus in the gym wasn't as good as the last version, which may be due to me dieting but was still a definite increase. With the competitive price, and deals that are always going on I will definitely continue to use this product, maybe watermelon next time!\n",
      "The new formula C4 Dreamsicle was the bomb! As soon as I opened the bottle and saw how the powder was smooth and not gritty, I knew it was going to mix so much better than the old formula. The taste was smooth and tasty, not overpowering at all. My workout was 45 minutes later after taking it but 20 minutes after drinking it I felt pumped and ready to destroy the gym! I noticed that I was more determined to hit 15 reps in my sets rather than the normal 10. two thumbs up on the new formula!\n",
      "I really loved the updated version on the original c4. The taste was amazing. I had watermelon and it tastes just like a watermelon jolly rancher.  It mixed well with water.  Gave me great focus and the extra caffeine that was added made it great as well! Would definitely recommend this to everyone!  Great product!\n",
      "Holy crap! Let me start with that...  So I normally take 2 scoops (of course) of your typical pre-workout even the old C4.  So did that this morning and took 2 scoops let me tell you I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin, it had me super pumped physically and mentally.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely recommend (start with 1 scoop though)\n",
      "I received a free sample tub of the new, Generation 4 Cellucor C4 pre workout powder to try (watermelon). I mix one scoop with 4 ounces of water, 20 minutes before my morning workout. It mixes very easily with a spoon. I LOVE the taste of the watermelon and wish I could drink it all day. I lift weights and since using this product, I have noticed an increase in my strength. This is exciting since I had stalled. I think that could be a result of the TeaCor that is in the new formula. With the additional caffeine, I do notice my energy has also increased. Cellucor's C4 is the only preworkout powder I will take (unless I need caffeine-free). The new 4th generation is impressive; I could tell it positively affected my performance.\n",
      "Just like it claims, I felt like I was taking this for the first time! I love the new formula! You get the same great taste and mix as before, but I had energy throughout my entire workout. This is definitely a must have! \n",
      "I actually have two flavors of this, one that isn't listed which is green apple. Both Icy blue razz and green apple are the best flavors I have ever purchased. This product is by far the best pre workout. I've been taking it for almost a year now and its amazing. I've seen great progress and It helps me through my workout. I've tried other pre workouts but stopped using them because the flavor is just bad, but this is the best. I recommend this to anyone who wants an amazing pre workout. This company has the best products. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the pre-workouts I have tried in the past, C4 is by far my favorite one.  It mixes well, tastes great, and it gets me amped up and ready to go for my workouts.  My energy and strength levels are through the roof when I take C4.  I highly, highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a horrible tasting pwo in both flavors i'v tried.  The pump is pretty good but it only has 135mg caffeine so you might be finding yourself doubling up on ur scoops.  Focus isn't bad, pump is good, and it doesn't last that long.  I recently switched to Gaspari's Superdrive and it's pretty intense in terms of focus and I don't dare go over one scoop lol.  \n",
      "So didn't know what to think of the new c4 G4 line but man was I glad I tried it! I think the taste is better ( not overly sweet) not to much beta, and had me crazy focused! \n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucor does it again with C4. Great all around product with a diverse profile. I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried it!\n",
      "I recently got a tub of Cellucor's G4 C4.  Ive been excited to try this since the announcement.  Upon receiving it I noticed the packing had a facelift and it looked pretty nifty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went on to check out the back and see what exactly had changed.  I first noticed the Caffeine was bumped up 120mg to 150mg.  They had also added Teacor (Theacrine), which I had read about before receiving my tub.  Teacor is suppose to be similar to Caffeine, but last longer, hit harder and have less of a tolerance buildup.  So hopefully we can get away from the 2 scoops, maybe 3 today cause this stuff isnt hitting that hard that some people have issues with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mixability is just as you would expect from C4, a few shakes and youre all good to go.  Ive never had issues with it not mixing, and Ive done very little water to lots of water with my shakes. Definately rate it a  10/10.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is just as good, I had Fruit Punch.  Not overpowering like some brands Ive had with fruit punch or a tropical flavor.  Easy to drink and down. Id give it a 9/10, simply because Green Apple is my preferred and go to flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I take this stuff about 20 minutes before getting to the gym and have had a nice steady flow of energy throughout my workout.  It doesnt hit me as hard all at once like the previous formula, which I actually like better that it doesnt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good pre-workout or anyone that asks me I always recommend this stuff.  Cant go wrong with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I finally got a chance to try out Cellucor's g4 version of c4. This is a great pre workout. There are a few differences. They bumped up the caffeine from 120mg to 150. They removed the synephrine and added teacore.\n",
      "\n",
      "TeaCor™ Tetramethyluric acid (Theacrine)\n",
      "\n",
      "it behaves similarly to caffeine, yet has way less tolerance issues, so these tubs will make you feel great all the way through.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucor’s hope is that complaints like “two scoops isn’t doing it for me anymore” should be a thing of the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the science and origin, Theacrine is an alkaloid that is naturally synthesized from caffeine in certain plants, such as certain Kucha plants(Kucha tea is actually quite popular in some parts of the world).\n",

      "Taste - now we all know cellucor is always top notch with taste and they did not disappoint again. I used the watermelon and I believe the taste is even more a jolly rancher taste.\n",
      "I took this pre-workout with 4oz of water it was extremely strong flavoring. when I used it  with 12oz of water the taste was very subtle\n",

      "Now before we get into the rest let me explain how I am working out right now. I am currently getting ready for a muay thai. so my first workout in the morning is 1hr worth of circuit training. 1hr of muay thai techinque and 1hr sparring. my night training is 5mile run and 45min of strength training.\n",
      "This training is 6days a week which is very strenious on my body. my night training I use alpha amino pre workout and intra.\n",
      "\n",
      "endurance - with my workouts I would tend to start slowing down mid way through the morning workout and really start dragging through the  sparring sessions. with using c4 I was able to last a lot longer before I started getting tired. The thing with this c4 is it creeps up on you and doesn't slam you all at once.  I was having a lot more energy going into my sparring sessions and wasn't almost collapsing at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "with my night training I would be tired going into my strength training do to the 5 mile run. with using the c4 before the run I was not tired going into my strength training.\n",

      "final thoughts - g4 c4 did not disappoint in anyway. everything cellucor bosted about this product was true. this product will give you the energy and endurance to withstand any workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "cost wise this very affordable and worth the money due to what it is going to do for your workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "overall rating 9/10\n",
      "The NEW G4 C4 extreme is legit. Seriously works so awesome and gives me the energy I need to kill my workouts. As soon as I take the first drink I can feel it start working and the tingling begins. So many great improvements!! Would recommend to anyone wanting to kill their workouts. \n",
      "I Prefer this C4 over the previous version. I think its a little stronger. C4 is a slightly weaker pre workout per serving while only 150mg of caffeine however the dosage at two servings makes me feel better than any other one serving preworkout. I really love this product. Flavor is good, a little sour. Blue razz will always be my favorite. I would recommend this product to anyone. \n",
      "I LOVE C4! it may not be the strongest preworkout, and it may not make u wannna rip ur skin off. but it does get the job done. gets u focused and gives u a little umphh. i mean it should come mostly from you the drive to workout, but this just helps you go beastmode! love it. favorite preworkout. loyal customer tothis product!\n",
      "Flavor is great! but everything else is kinda ehhh\n",
      "This preworkout has been the best I have tried so far.  It makes me feel much more energized for workouts after a long day of work without making me feel anxious or overcaffeinated. The watermelon flavor also tastes great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do only take approximately 1/2 to 2/3 of the recommended serving size because of my weight, and it works great.\n",
      "Good pre-workout for those who lift late and are sensitive to caffeine.\n",
      "This was the first pre work out i tried ever and im so glad it was. I didn't have any caffeine in my diet prior to trying this the first time and i was so scared from all the horror pre workout reviews ive read on many products. It kicks in a good amount of time 15-20 ish for me and its light but strong. It doesn't make you feel like you want to crawl out of your skin or feel like you heart is going to explode. Just the right amount of \"umph\" to get your butt into gear!!!!\n",
      "10/10\n",
      "and the pink lemonade tastes just like pink lemonade its freaking delicious!\n",
      "This is the first pre-workout supplement that i ever used and it has done wonders for me. I hit the gym after work, so i'm usually drained from the day. A scoop and a half of C4 and I'm ready to go! I feel a little tingly/itchy when it first kicks but that goes away. This stuff definitely helps me get through my work out. This stuff mixes well and the flavor is great!\n",
      "\n",
      "i have used this product twice before and now waiting for the 3rd to arrive\n",
      "its very good pre-workout with amazing flavor, my favorite is strawberry margarita, i have tried watermelon as well which is awesome \n",
      "\n",
      "mojito wasnt my fav taste,but still not bad, better than others\n",
      "Unbelievable power , strength and speed  .. I felt like i dun wanna leave the gym .. Big pushing up at the weights but it would be perfect with little pumps .\n",
      "One scoop gave me more energy and drive than two scoops of my other PWO. I'm new to sups like this, but I don't usually seem to be too sensitive to stims, but this was nuts. I LOVE tingles, and I have never felt them as strong as I did with this. Sweated my butt off and benched without a spotter (which is usually necessary for me!) I always push hard mentally, this just gave me the energy to push physically. Recommended for newbies. \n",
      "One of, if not the best, pre-workout I have tried yet. Tastes great, mixes well, and the pumps are awesome! I would definitely recommend this to anyone trying to go hard in the gym.\n",
      "I'm a huge fan of the Strawberry Margarita flavor, it is absolutely amazing. The pump is great, it does comes on pretty smooth and does not leave me to crash 45 minutes into a long workout like a few other supplements do. \n",
      "I love this stuff.  It takes about 20 minutes for it to really hit me, but when it does, I can tell a huge difference.  If I forget to take it I can tell for sure.  It gives me extra energy for about an hour.  No jitters or any side effects.\n",
      "Watermelon tastes great! It honestly tastes like a watermelon jolly rancher. In my opinion this stuff is pretty potent as well, despite what others have said. I take about 1.5-2 scoops before working out and I don't get tired....at all during my workouts. I'm certainly not sensitive to caffeine, and this isn't my first pre-workout either, so good stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only minor complaint is you know on the side of the bottle where it says \"settling may occur\"? Yeah, this stuff settled A LOT. When I opened the bottle for the first time, it was about half empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will agree with others that the price per serving is a little high, but it definitely gives you that \"push\" in the weight room. I personally don't take this stuff every time I workout, so that kind of helps it last longer and is probably healthier for you anyways.\n",
      "Okay but 1 scoop is too weak. 2 scoops / servings kills the price/serving.\n",
      "Overall, it gave me great energy and solid workouts. Nothing  bad to say about it. Occasionally maybe it did give me pretty bad beta alanine tingles but overall solid.\n",
      "taste is spot on and no bad aftertaste. i like that fact that i am trying c4 again without the bad aftertaste and jitters, increased heart rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEW Update- thank you for the free bag and c4 products, it is def a change in the product because it seem a little tone down but def still better\n",
      "It's an okay pre workout after all, gives additional pump but not like Extreme Shock gives me, okay flavor and endurance due to beta alanine I just must have fast carbs with it or else I go dizzy..\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my favorite pre-workout supplement so far. I have tried Arnold's Iron Pump which was great the first day, but nothing after that. I used to use Amino Energy, it gave decent energy, but the scoop recommendation for a workout was like 6 scoops or something crazy, and the mixture was terrible. I usually use 1 1/2-2 scoops of my pre workout toget the full effect. I mix it with about 4-6 ounces of water, it mixes good enough for me to chug it down fast without much residue. It starts to kick in in about 30 minutes for me. I get great pumps and forearm vascularity. Not much of a tingle effect until i take 2 scoops, although the tingle has never bothered me. I have great energy for the hour, hour and a half I am at the gym. Overall best preworkout I have tried yet. Each flavor I have tried with the exception of the mystery flavor has been very good. But the mystery flavor is TERRIBLE. It still gives me the same effect though.\n",
      "This is a go-to pre workout. Not the strongest, but would recommend to anyone just getting into the pre-workout scene. I really like the Creatine Nitrate, a nice feature. I do however have to take 1.5 scoops if not two. Mixes great and every flavor I've tried I love. It gives you that Beta-Alanine tingle that says...\"It's time to lift!\". I alternate this with my EVL ENGN, and sometimes get crazy and mix the two (not for the weak!) \n",
      "\n",
      "This is for sure one of those products that felt and worked great. For about a week.  After that I felt no different before/after taking it.  I wouldn't really recommend this one. \n",
      "Not strong enough at all, had to take multiple scoops to feel anything. Good introductory pre-workout for those new to pwo supps.\n",
      "Worked fantasticly for a while, stuff made me want to bench press cars. Now it just seems to be enough to give me a little more than usual.\n",
      "taste is ok, but what is real thing, that it WORKS! With no some weird kicks in, just easy,drink half hour before gym, and your training goes as you've planed. and after 2 weeks of using C4, I've increased in body mass and in weight i push. Great product! \n",
      "C4 Extreme is absolutely amazing! I've tried several pre-workouts and none compare to this. It provides the initial boost to get in the gym and the extra endurance to stay in the gym! I can feel the blood flow throughout my body which makes the pump so much more intense! Flavors aren't bad either. Orange tastes like a giant vitamin C shot! Definitely recommend this product to all lifters beginning to experienced!\n",
      "I love love love the C4 Extreme. It gets me pumped for my workouts with just the right amount of beta-alanine that makes me not want to stretch my face off, but aids me with the recovery that I need to push it in the gym. All the flavors I have tried taste great and I would definitely recommend them. \n",
      "I have been using Cellucor C4 extreme for about 5 months now. Honestly, I haven't tried many other PWO products because this one works so well for me. I get the mental clarity, the focused energy, decreased fatigue, and the B-A tingles that I love. There is a reason that this is an extremely well-known product, as well as being the 3rd best seller on this site. I was waiting for the Sweet Tea flavor to arrive on bb.com, and I purchased it as soon as it did. The flavor is great. Maybe not a Crystal Light or Lipton sweet tea flavor, but a very nice departure from the regular overdone fruit flavors. Icy Blue Razz is also delicious, as confirmed by the many positive reviews. I can't wait to try some other C4 flavors in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am full on addicted to C4 I will take it every day of the week. The taste is delicious and it won't bother your stomach like other pre workouts. Theres a ton of great flavors so I never get bored of it. Gets me to where I need to go for my workouts. I also created the C4Loko which I'm sure those of you who are 21+ can figure that out\n",
      "C4 didn't really do anything for my workout (I could feel a little caffein, but no better pumps). It seems like a good basic pre workout, but it instead of giving me explosive workouts, it gave me explosive diarrhea.\n",
      "Stuff works great.  But I do have to use 2 scoops.\n",
      "Best overall preworkout I have come across, less dropoff after initial wave. etc.\n",
      "For a pre-workout supplement C-4 is my main go to. It has never failed to give me the energy, pump, and focus I need during my workouts. I tend to enjoy the fruit punch, more than the watermelon. Simply due to the watermelon tasting a bit more like cotton candy than anything else. \n",
      "I think it is the best of all the pre workout supplements that I have tried.\n",
      "Tried a lot of them.\n",
      "I use it for 4 weeks and stay off for 2.\n",
      "Works for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another great product by Cellucor, I take this preworkout on the days I need that extra kick in the booty! Love all the new flavors they have came out with, C4 gives me that extra rep and I never crash after taking cellucor like other pre works. C4 is gentle on my stomach and the fact that they list all the ingredients of the back of the bottle, is another reason I love it. No fillers on this stuff. Great product. Try all the flavors.\n",
      "Excellent product!!! I love the taste and the feeling it gives me all throughout workout!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "great product. tastes well and gives good endurance and pump!\n",
      "One of the more popular pre-workouts and when it went on sale I couldn't resist. Mixes quick and easy, 12  oz of water and no issues. Orange dreamsicle didn't fit its name, just seemed like plain orange to me, but it was still decent. Watermelon and fruit punch were good and lived up to their billing, but watermelon lingered in my shaker long after it was gone. It says wait 20 minutes for the work-out to kick in and that was about right. I normally felt some energy set in at 15-20 minutes depending on how lethargic I had been. I got a pretty good rush from the product nothing extreme, but it made me amped to lift. The energy didn't last long from me about 30 minutes into my workout I would start to burnout. I like the product, but only for shorter (30~45 min) workouts.\n",
      "I have become a big fan of several Cellucor products, so when looking for another pre-workout supplement I decided to try a sample pack of this. I have been using my husband's **** (vitamin shoppe brand) pre-workout powder, & I like the way it works, but it tastes awful. I REALLY wish this C4 worked- it mixes easily, the Strawberry Margarita tastes absolutely amazing, but 1 1/2 scoops of this did nothing for me. Their BCAA supplement does more for me. I got no energy, no pump, no tingle, nothing from taking this. And I'm a 130b female, so I could imagine guys wouldn't get anything out of this. I normally get away with cutting serving sizes of some supplements in half because of my size, but doing more than 1 scoop had no effect on me.\n",
      "Mixed perfectly, there was no foam unlike any NO products. Used for leg day and the pump i got was unreal, however gave me serious rot-gut and burps. Im not sure if it does this every time but hell the pump was worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stick to prejym because of transparent dosing and the science behind it. But C4 is a very good preworkout. You get what you need out of it, mixes great as well. And the mojito flavor was very refreshing\n",
      "Gets the job done. Not that great on Pump, I've used NO3 and no pump there. Gives moderate energy. I've been on strong pre-workout beforeaand this somewhere in the middle with energy and pump. Lots of focus if you have a long day ahead of you. \n",
      "C4!!! This stuff is pretty awesome. It has just the right amount of punch to wake me up and keep me focused. With every product there is has its pros and cons but believe me the con of this product isn't something unusual its just something I didnt like personally about the product. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Extreme Focus\n",
      "Loads of Energy\n",
      "Great Pump\n",
      "Just the right amount of Beta Alanine and Arginine\n",
      "\n",
      "This is exactly what I look for in a product when I am using it for strength. Every time I know I am doing something heavy you better believe Im reaching in my bag for 2 scoops of C4. \n",
      "\n",
      "It taste amazing, the Pineapple taste almost like pineapple juice with a slight supplement/sucralose flavor but it isnt anything disgusting like some of the other preworkouts out there. No joke cellucor prides themselves on their flavor profiles and they do an awesome job with this product amongst others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mojito flavor isn't the best in my opinion. It taste nothing like a mojito with or without alcohol, kinda feels like a lime taste with a very slight hint of mint. either way i still drink it. \n",
      "\n",
      "To be completely honest the powder taste so good you could literally just scoop it into your mouth and swish around some water for extreme results. \n",
      "\n",
      "It blends great, no blender bottle needed, heck no bottle needed if your'e in a rush. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: \n",
      "Gnarly Bloating\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldnt ever suggest anyone to use this product when they are focusing on cardio, this stuff makes your heart beat and beat fast.... I mean you may feel like the energizer bunny for a moment but shortly after someone will have to grab the D-fib unit and try to sync your heart back into rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isnt the first or last time I use C4 for strength training, but the bloat gets annoying sometimes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Either way bloat or not... no product ive used compares to this... its just right \n",
      "This stuff tastes just like watermelon with no nasty aftertaste, I also love the help it gives with workouts, extra energy, with just a little tingling as I am sensitive to niacin. I would recommend anyone to try this product.\n",
      "when i first started working out i bought muscletech neurocore, and wasnt that impressed with it and a buddy told me to try C4, well i tried it and loved it and havnt used anything since, but i have been wanting to try n.o-xplode for awhile now, the same friend that got me onto C4 also recommended it  \n",
      "With C4 I have had some of the best workouts weather its to just give me that extra motivation on this days to get me to the gym or on those days which I need that extra set. Flavor is important to me, because if it doesn't taste good that will have a direct correlation with my entire workout. \n",
      "Great product. I love using C4 before cardio sessions or even before playing basketball.\n",
      "The first few times I took C4 Extreme, I used one scoop and didn't notice a difference at all. However, the second scoop made a huge difference for me and I definitely felt more focused and energized. As far as endurance goes, I can't say for sure that this will boost it, but it certainly does give you a nice and ready feeling. \n",
      "Also, the product mixes very well and tastes delicious. I did not incur any digestive problems or irritating tingly feelings from it either. \n",
      "great pre-workout. gives me the pump and the energy i need to be in the gym doing more reps \n",
      "One of my favorite pre-workouts on the market. It gives you good energy and a surreal pump. Only downside is that more than one scoop is needed for me.  \n",
      "It's hard to believe, but the green apple flavor tastes like candy' almost like a jolly rancher. \n",
      "Sweet Tea and Strawberry Margarita are spot on! I love C4 in general, but they really nailed it with these two. Great pump and good energy.\n",
      "Provides more energy and great focus.  And mixes well, too!!  \n",
      "I would give this product a 10 if it didn't make my face and front of my entire body itch and have this creepy/crawly feeling. Yes, I have tried different concentrations (powder vs water ratios) but I still get the same effect. It definitely gives me energy and makes me go longer, but that is then inhibited by me constantly touching my face and body because I am so itchy. It feels like bugs crawling all over me and that is super distracting. I had to switch to Beast Sports Beast Mode pre workout because I couldn't take it anymore.\n",
      "This flavor is in my top 3 flavors because it reminds me of orange hi-c and its a great alternative flavor when you're also drinking Icy blue raspberry and mojito.\n",
      "Tried a lot of pre-workouts out there and C4 is by far the best.  Gives me the most energy and the best pump.\n",
      "Great Pre-workout! I feel energized and focused and this doesn't leave me jittery. I've done some of my best workouts while taking this.  Great flavors, expect watermelon it was weak and kinda gross. Mojito, Pink Lemonade and Strawberry Margarita were very good. Same results with all flavors\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to wind up damning C4 with faint praise.  Yes, the caffeine helps with focus, the creatine helps with recovery, but  bottom line - C4 works neither better or worse than other pre-workout product.  Biggest downside is that I had to double up on the serving size to get any effect at all; that makes this a pretty expensive choice.  Flavors are not exceptional (I expected better from other reviews) but certainly tolerable.\n",
      "Flavor was pretty good.  This thing just gave me the jitters preworkout and caused some nausea.  The nausea of course made my workouts harder so I stopped taking it. \n",
      "I always looking for a little extra kick for my workouts and I love this product! I would find myself doing sprints upon sprints without getting tired as fast as I would without using it. Great flavors too, I love icy blue razz and watermelon but watermelon is my favorite because it tastes just like a watermelon jolly rancher! But I've noticed my body gets immune to it after using it for awhile and find myself using 3-4 scoops (whoops), so it's a good idea to stop using it for awhile and then get back to using it. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's tasty, despity be very sweet. It makes a good effect in the beging, but it disappears with time, hence you need to elevate de dosage which is not good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It does help with the energy level. Been using it for a few weeks now. I would recommend the Icy Blue Razz flavor. \n",
      "Took one scoop for the first use, and did absolutely nothing.  Next day did two scoops and felt very focused, not so much energy after a long day of work.  Was very vascular/pumped after the workout from the dose of no3.  Pre workouts in general are very mind oriented in my opinion, but works if you need a boost.  \n",
      "The flavors are amazing! The Orange Dreamsicle tastes just like an Orange Julious smoothie...and the orange flavor is more of a natural flavor and not artificial. The product (no matter the flavor) is intense and I love that it makes me work harder and I have been seeing results because of the way I have been pushing myself every day in the gym.\n",
      "Great product. Really gives me a good pump and helps me get those extra reps in.\n",
      "This in my opinion is the best pre-workout available. Keeps you pumped through you whole workout. Can't go wrong with C4, especially pink lemonade!\n",
      "Great flavor and mixes well.  Gives me good focus, but after about 2 weeks I needed to up the serving size.  I plan on getting more when I run out.\n",
      "This product is amazing! It gives me a lot of energy and it makes you feel great during the workout. I swim a couple times a week and I really see a difference in my lap times, but I also use it before my spinning and TRX classes. When I take it I feel like I can achieve so much more! I have just re-ordered it in Strawberry Margarita and Mojito. Really great product!\n",
      "\n",
      "btter than most other pre workouts ive tried 1000 times better than no xplode    \n",
      "and I definetly would recomend\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Could feel this preworkout start kicking in after only 10 minutes. One of the best I've had, even better than jack3d! definitely recommend this to everybody!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is excellent, a bit sour - which I love. I'm very sensitive to caffeine, but this stuff does not make me jittery. Instead give me a burning tingly feeling that I can only compare to no flush Niacin, but not nearly as extreme. My only gripe is the punch doesn't last very long.\n",
      "Pre workouts never give me a ton of energy but this takes the edge off after a long work day. Also for a pre workout dosnt taste bad.\n",
      "Great product! Can't go wrong with C4 if you're new to pre workouts and lookin for somethin good. I've tried several including Jack3d, Mr. Hyde, X fit trainer, Iron Pump, N. O. Explode, and Super Pump Max. Not that these are bad products. C4 is just my personal favorite. Love the Orange Dreamsicle!!! \n",
      "I'm the guy that goes to the gym and never completes a workout because I usually run out of energy and quit while I'm ahead, just to return the next day and repeat. This is actually the first pre workout supplement I've tried other than muscle milk pre mixed protein shakes. And I gotta say it works! I was a bit skeptical about creatine because of the water gains, but a trainer at the gym recommended I try c4. Just a 5 serving to see how it works. Well, I just bought a 30 serving tub. I like the energy it gives me and I've never been so focused and it tastes great. Might not use it for the full eight week limit, due to my skepticism about water gains, but I like it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked this pre-workout and the flavor was great. I found myself having to take about 1.5 servings to get the necessary pump I was looking for during my workout, but still would rate this product high in comparison to other pre-workouts I have tried.\n",
      "One of my favorite pre-workout choices. Unlike other pre-workouts, it never gets old;  you always feel the energy and the pump. And you can't beat the deals on BB.com where you can get about 3 of them for the price of 1.5 of them.\n",
      "Great flavor and have seen some decent results\n",
      "I love the variety of flavors that C4 has, definitely gives us a nice selection of supplements to use prior to workout that we can enjoy. The Fruit Punch and Blue Razz are by far my favorite of their line of pre-workout, the mojito and margarita ones have a very strong flavor that I didn't like, but were easily still pretty good. Overall, if you're looking for a nice pre-workout supplement that gives a great kick and has an awesome taste for the right price, I'd recommend C4 all the way.\n",
      "I can't say I feel any extra energy during my workout if I take it right before the gym. The creatin does give you a quick noticeable muscle increase, probably filling your muscles up with extra water.\n",
      "Not a huge energy boost, but it gave me a slight tingle and a little extra pep in my step and increased mental alertness without any jitters. It also provided for some extra pumps in the target muscles during the workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this product.  I mix one scoop with a small amount of water and drink right when I get up in the morning.  By the time I change clothes, brush teeth and prep my breakfast, I am ready to workout!! BAM!\n",
      "The first day I tried this I felt like all the hairs on my body were screaming.  That feeling subsided and now I just feel energy, so don't freak out the first time you try it!  Ha!\n",
      "I get an excellent pump from this product.  On C4 I sweat more and my energy levels stay high through the duration of my workout.  I am a regular coffee drinker, so I have a high caffeine tolerance. Despite this, I still get great results from this product.  I have never experienced any shakes or jitteriness from using it (even when taking a generous 2 scoops).  I have never had difficulty sleeping either.  I have a preference for tartness so the green apple, icy blue razz, and watermelon are right up my alley.\n",
      "One of the best tasting products i have ever had. Better than BPI's -  1.M.R., better than NOExplode, better than BSN - Amino X.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the product worked better than Force Factor and 1MR. Within a half hour I could feel the pump in my muscles and my energy level was up. I felt my muscles were gorged with water after my workouts. What a pump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Energy and pump\n",
      "WOW! I'm stimulant sensitive so taking a pre-workout was nerve racking for me because I had no clue how I'd react. C4 was the ticket. Within 15 minutes of the first time I took it, I had great clean energy and was ready to throw some weights around. The difference in my workouts in just the first week alone have been incredible.. far less fatigue, able to increase my weight on just about every exercise, and no nasty crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're stimulant sensitive, start with C4 first. This has worked for me, and I have no regrets in taking it. Now a permanent part of my stack. I suggest taking with Cellucor's Alpha Amino to really see the true benefits of Cellucor's lineup here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strawberry Margarita is so **** good, I love it! Great flavor. I could drink this stuff on the daily! \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried Cellucor for the first time this month and I have to say that this product is great. I have to use 2 scoops because one scoop does nothing for me. Since using this product I am able to make it through my workouts successfully.I also have great energy for the rest of the day.  I didn't experience jitters or a crash in my system at all after taking cellucor. I have tried other pre-workout products in the past, but this is by far the best and longer lasting suppliment by far. \n",
      "C4 is an amazing product! great pump! (Secret: one serving of C4 and then add two servings of NOW Beta-Alanine Powder and you'll be killing it in the gym! plus it'll save you so much money not having to use two scoops) \n",
      "C4 is the best pre-workout I have ever taken. I've tried other products (NOxplode) and none of them were as effective as C4. The Fruit Punch is my favorite flavor because it tastes like Kool-Aid with a edgy sour after taste. I don't recommend taking more than 2 scoops at a time because 3+ scoops always upsets my stomach. \n",
      "Best pre-workout on the market to me. It may not be the best in each area but overall it is the best, hands down. Dat Blue Razz Tho!!!\n",
      "Love this pre workout. Tastes great and works even better. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tasted very good. NO ENERGY OR PUMP THOUGH!!!!\n",
      "Tastes like orange kolaid and hasn't lost any of its punch after continued use! AAA product and I've already recommended to all of my lifter friends ,\n",
      "This prodcut isn't working for me. First time I felt kind of a nasty \"tingling\" which began to hurt badly during workout, mostly in those parts of the body which were more under tension/stress duringf workout. NO strength gain or better focus whatsoever. The second day same story, I didn't feel any benefit from it but I kept using it for a week or so thinking my body would adapt to it... Worst product I've ever tried in my life!\n",
      "So the taste is not too bad, tastes like a watermelon jolly rancher candy it is tart, but ok. as far as working...I never felt the \"tingling\" even with a  2 scoop dosage. The first couple times I took it I did notice the energy level was sustained throughout my workout 1 1/2 hour time frame. Now after taking another product, C4 has no effect no me now, my last workout with C4 I felt tired and unmotivated. \n",
      "Pretty good pump on an empty stomach generally takes me two servings and sometimes it a really good one other times it doesnt hit me a lot. The pink lemonade flavors really good!\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes great and get's me up for a workout like nothing else.  I've tried other products and they don't come close.\n",
      "I've been using this pre-workout drink for about 3 months now, and it's one of the best that I've used. It really gives you a great energy boost before heading to the gym, and the Icy Blue Razz flavor tastes great! \n",
      "This is by far my favorite Pre-Workout, always does the trick. I can take this and it still gives me enough energy to work a full 12 hr shift lifting tires all night (Graveyard shift) without being at all tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a solid preworkout.  Not my top pre but definitely a great budget option due to the sales Cellucor runs on here as well the numerous stacks available.  I have gone through numerous flavors over the years and although I haven't used it in a while I got the opportunity to from a promo offered on the forums and really enjoyed this new flavor.  Great taste, pumps, energy, and value, you really can't go wrong.\n",
      "Really like this.  Gives me a great energy boost at the beginning of my work out.  So far orange is my favourite flavour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the flavor! I usually prefer fruity flavors and with so many options of C4 flavors, I decided to venture beyond my usual.  Not overly tart (or use less water if you prefer it that way!) but still sweet.  I use it before my lifting sessions and appreciate the added pump I get--especially doing my pullups and pushups!! \n",
      "It's not a one-scoop product and its formula isn't perfect, but C4 delivers some uncommon benefits that make it a really effective preworkout once you find your dose. With 135mg caffeine and ~321mg nitrates per scoop, all but the most substance-na�ve will quickly be looking to the top end of C4's dosage recommendations to achieve the full benefits; the inclusion of arginine over something like citrulline is a bit disappointing, but nitrates more than make up for this. The inclusion of tyrosine gives a little extra edge to the mental component, as well: C4 will deliver nicely on energy, focus, endurance and recovery. The Pineapple flavor is fantastic, but not super sweet like you might expect--closer to real pineapple juice with tartness.\n",
      "Cellucor's C4 is one of the best, if not the best pre-workout supplement on the market. The surge of energy is fast with no crashing side-effect. This product is definitely my go to pre-workout. I would recommend it to both beginners and seasoned athletes. The flavor is outstanding too. I haven't tried a bad one yet. Pineapple is my favorite and tastes very close to eating an actual pineapple. If you haven't tried C4 you are definitely missing out on a great product that you are guaranteed to love.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Did one scoop into a 8oz bottle of water. I didn't feel the extra kick or tingling censation as i did with the Fruit Punch flavor (same dosing). Not sure if its this specific flavor. Will do 1 1/2 scoops to see if anything changes.\n",
      "----Mixing --10/10----\n",
      "Mixing was great in 6oz of water and it dissolved easy. \n",
      "----Taste -- 9/10----\n",
      "The Mojito has a distinct Lime/Mint flavor; I mixed 1 scoop in 6oz. of water. The flavor is great, I liked the Mint Flavor as it goes down smooth and has no aftertaste. \n",
      "----Energy -- 9/10----\n",
      "I used 20 minutes before workout, after drinking it only took about 15 minutes for me to start feeling the energy. The energy started smooth and intensified and continued until after I finished workout. \n",
      "----Focus -- 9/10----\n",
      "Focus was sharp, I felt completely focused and kept moving to my next exercise as if I didn't see anything but the weights. \n",
      "----Strength -- 10/10----\n",
      "The strength was great, I added a couple of sets to bench press and no problem adding more pull-ups. \n",
      "----Overall -- 9/10----\n",
      "The strength, focus and energy were great. No stomach issues with a great profile make this a great pre-workout with no crashing after. C4 is a great pre-workout supplement. It will give you great energy, great pumps and focus. I recommend others to try C4 Extreme for an intense, focused workout. If you like Lime/Mint definitely gives Mojito a try!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is your favorite product, you're a victim of mainstream marketing and national brand. There are literally 10-15 other superior pre-workout products. It has lots of caffeine and beta-alanine per scoop, so it will supply plenty of tingles and plenty of energy... that's all. If you want a product that combines these features as well as makes you stronger, more focused, and provides b etter pumps, look elsewhere. \n",
      "Cellucor C4 is a great all around pre-workout supplement.  It supplies good pumps, great energy, and dem Beta Alanine tingles mane.   I mixed one scoop in 3-4 ounces of water, then shot it down. Taken 10-15 minutes before workout.\n",
      "i tried all the flavors they where all good and did give me energy and gave me the pump i needed\n",
      "I tried for the first time today one of the free samples i got, flavor watermelon. It was the most disgusting thing i've ever tasted, for real. The packaging was violated so maybe it was bad, dunno how can people like so much this flavor, its horrible. The effects are ok, but nothing much, i think i need a higher dose cause one scoop didnt do very much. I hope the other flavors are better, cause this watermelon free sample its going to the trash, no doubt!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the best pre-workout drinks I have tried. It gives me that boost that I need to get those extra reps in every single time. The icy blue razz is a great tasting powder.\n",
      "This product definitely exceeded my expectations! The Lemon Lime flavor tastes exactly like Yellow Gatorade and it is outstanding! I love how C4 provides long lasting energy and definitely helps me with morning workouts. I would definitely give this a 10/10!!\n",
      "It does give you something extra than a pure workout but nothing special!\n",
      "Awesome taste. Sometimes a bit clumpy if you do not use a shaker cup but otherwise it mixes well. Best pre-workout I have taken since the original Jack 3d. I still get a slight itchy feeling with this but it is not as intense as other pre-workouts. However, it does allow me to get through my cardio and stay at the gym a hour or two longer. \n",
      "This is the best preworkout I have ever had. It has creatine in it though so make sure to read the label. Gives me the energy to get through my normal grueling workouts. Without this product I would never be where I am today. Favorite flavor is pinapple but they all taste good.\n",
      "Love it! Easy to drink and mix and it works!\n",
      "\n",
      " I've also tried adding some dextrose and ice chips and it tastes like a sno-cone!\n",
      "\n",
      " The workouts are about the same as the rest of the C4 extreme, obviously a good pump and loads of immediate energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Green Apple taste great. I get great energy and pumps. Mixes well. \n",
      "Best pre workout so far love it good product keep 3 on hand at all times\n",
      "\n",
      "I love C4... I take this for about a month to 2 months at a time and it definitely ignites my energy levels before a workout. It also gives me a noticeable amount of focus and the added bonus of a boost of strength in late reps. My body does adapt to in afar 3-4weeks though and while most benefits remain, the energy seems to taper off, so I recommend taking it in cycles and be sure to go without it for a couple weeks between orders. \n",
      "Strawberry Margarita is offensively delicious... Mojito is good, but a little too minty for my tastes. I was totally over it about halfway through my tub. Not entirely bad tho. \n",
      "Fruit Punch is also insanely good...\n",
      "I need to try Icy Blue Razz & Orange next.\n",
      "Great pre workout drink, definitely one of my favorite. Great energy and focus throughout entire workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me first say that I've tried a few pre workouts over the years and I've been prone to side effects, such as getting lightheaded, jittery, and overall just didn't feel right after I took them.  I have had not one negative side effect from C4.  It gives me a decent boost when I first take it, but the aspect where it shines the most for me is how focused it keeps me and how I can keep the intensity up for the entire workout.  It makes me workout longer and harder.  For instance, I find myself completing an entire workout and feel that I can keep going.  I'll hit up abs, cardio, or calves afterwards just because I feel I'm not ready to leave.  Overall, I cannot find one negative aspect of this product.  I've preached to several of my friends to how good it  is and none of them were disappointed.  You will build a tolerance to it so I recommend 4-6 weeks on and about 2 weeks off.  \n",
      "Used as a replacement for Craze DS. Don't get the same feeling of intense focus as with Craze, however, feel good and pumped nonetheless. In addition to weights, I do a lot of cardio with runs up to half-marathon distance. Have found C4 Extreme to be much gentler on my stomach than Craze DS (which always resulted in a pre-workout 'purge') and tolerate it better over long workout sessions. That said, doesn't give me that same feeling of invicibility and endless endurance that I felt with Craze.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great tasting, very effective for someone new to using a pwo. However, not powerful enough for me personally. I got used to the effects within a couple weeks and had to move up to two scoops.\n",
      "Before I used this, I would always hear positive feedbacks in my gym especially the G.I's. So I gave it a try, after my Fina Flex Stimul8 ran out. I could say this product isnt all hype and taste really good. Flavor and solubility was no problem. The effect is very good, meets my standard but didnt beat my Stimul8 feeling. This beats the tingly sensation of stimul8(too strong) and MusclePharm Assault(very long reaction or no effect). \n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: Worth trying. Take it and follow directions/cautions. Stock up on this\n",
      "I have never used a pre workout anything before, but me and my friend have been training hard with a personal trainer and his work outs were brutal. I could barley walk when I was done. My friend drank C4 before we went on a run one day and he smoked me!!! So I thought what the heck and gave it a try! OMG, what a difference!! I used once scoop and killed my workout and was ready for more!! I am normally sensitive to caffeine however I did not get jittery or crash with this product! I also felt in a better mood during and after my workout. I will always have this stuff on hand.\n",
      "Really like this product. Using 2 spoons 20-30 minutes prior to my training. Gives me additional power and pumping\n",
      "This is by far my go to pre-workout sup.  On top of that bodybuilding.com has the fastest shipping compared to any other site.  I have tried other places offering free shipping or freebies thrown in and NOBODY compares to bodybuilding.com\n",
      "Best pre-workout I have tried yet..  Awesome energy without the jitters, great ingredient profile,  and the fruit punch flavor kicks ***! I highly recommend this stuff! \n",
      "Just switched from NO X-plode and I seriously am obsessed with Cullucor C4 Extreme. It tastes smooth and goes down wonderfully. Super concentrated and provides serious energy!! \n",
      "By far one of the best tasting pre-workout drinks I've had . Great work out with it and don't have a severe crash afterwards\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product from Cellucor, everyone knows pre workouts are great.. but this one is awesome! It helps me stay focused at the gym and typically my first few big exercises I am able to kill it with this product. The flavors are great too.. the watermelon & apple smell like jolly ranchers and taste really good, blue raz is good too. The only flavor I've tried I haven't liked it Fruit Punch. \n",
      "\n",
      "The nice thing about this pre workout is I can drink it with 8-10 oz of water and its diluted enough, its not going to give you a bittery taste like xplode 2.0 or evl nutrition ENGN\n",
      "I was looking for a pre-workout that provided...well all of the things you want from a pre-workout - energy, pump, maybe even some tinglyness - C4 Extreem didn't really only made me feel a little tingly and weird. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also feel a little bloaty after taking it - not sure but a few reviews said that might be the type of creatine they use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus after I thought I got a good deal with the buy one get one deal I looked on Amazon and could have bought the 60 serving at full price and gotten a better deal (more servings) than on BB.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had used pre workouts in the past and didn't like how they made me feel. C4 extreme gives me energy but doesn't make me feel \"tweaked out\". I love it. I guess that's obvious by how many flavors I have!\n",
      "I don't feel this product\n",
      "it didn't effect me at all. i started with 1 scoop the first day as s****ested and nothing happened until i started using 3 scoops and still nothing. it looks like its a scam to me. \n",
      "This is extremely sugary tasting.  DO NOT TAKE ON EMPTY STOMACH.  It gives me a weird feeling if I do.  Otherwise the product operates as advertised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first pre workout i have ever tried, just didn't seem to work for me. No beta alanine tingles, or focus/energy. Didnt notice much a pump either. Taste is a 10/10 though. Switched to mr. Hyde and its great, works perfectly for me.\n",
      "C4 is a great product for cutting. I get a good deal of added intensity in the gym, however, the small amount Creatine nitrate does not really affect how heavy you can lift like pure creatine might. That said, it won't give you any water bloat like pure Creatine either.\n",
      "By far my favorite PWO. The flavor is awesome and it gets me through every workout. Whether it's cardio or lifting, it helps me tremendously. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.\n",
      "This worked very well for me and the first time I started taking two scoops it was incredible, but then I started to gain a tolerance for it. So I'm planning on moving on to something else and then coming back to it in a month and see if it will give me the same energy it had given me before.\n",
      "THIS IS THE BEST PRE WORK OUT EVER.... I SIMPLY LOVE IT..\n",
      "IT HELPS ME TO FINISH THOSE REPS I KNOW I COULDNT FINISH WITHOUT IT...\n",
      "Use with caution! Extreme energy results! This stuff will make you dance! \n",
      "I love this product! Makes me really pumped! And makes me workout for at least 2 hours! LOOVVVEEE\n",
      "I have been using this product for the last 2 months in 3 different flavors. I purchased the Pink Lemonade, Icy Blue Razz, and Mojito. The Pink Lemonade is my favorite. The Icy Blue Razz is like any other Blue Razz flavor. The Mojito is enjoyable but it can be a little chalky tasting aftertaste. All in all I like the product. Get the nice tingle about 20 mins after taking it. Easy to figure out how long ago I took it cause the tingling is pretty consistent in timing for me.  \n",
      "Great taste! And starts working after about 20-30 mins. \n",
      "I hardly used pre-workout supplements but wanted to try C4 out. It is a great product. The taste of Strawberry Margarita is outstanding and it mixes well with water.  I have only been taking it for a week but it gives me energy throughout my workouts and makes me want to push harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Watermelon flavor is outstanding\n",
      "The Pink Lemonade taste AMAZING! the best tasting PWS I have bought. Didnt feel much of a change but lifted more weight with more reps. Great product.\n",
      "This product does work! Gives you a real good burn while you are working out. I tend to sweat much more and have more intensity when using this product pre-workout. Doesn't taste bad. I mix with full bottle of water. Starts working faster than 30min as instructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "C4 is my favorite Pre its the only pre I have taken more then once because I have gotten amazing workout in while taken this product. C4 makes it possible to keep pushing myself till I felt my workout was complete. I never had a bad reaction to C4 except for being itchy once in awhile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Was great the firs time I used it. Now I hardly get a PUMP from it anymore... This product is all taste no results.... Guess its more suitable for entry level female athletes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Im not even using it anymore. using the pre workout I got as a special with another product I bought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "C4 might not be the most amazing preworkout I've used but it certainly gets the job done and is good value for money. Definitely get that tingly pump/prework beta alanine rush that get's me jacked before my lifts. Like all Cellucor products I've used the flavors are nothing short of amazing. Only complaint I might have is that tolerance is increasing meaning I have to use more scoops. Great product overall. Mojito flavor is a party in my mouth. Strawberry Marg is good but very sweet. Pink Lemonade is also a winner. \n",
      "\n",
      "Will absolutely be buying again, can't wait to try all the flavors!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is pretty effective booster for me. However, I did build a tolerance to it rather quickly but using 2 scoops instead of 1 cleared that right up. \n",
      "I bought a sample of this when it was recommended buy a golds gym employee, and didn't notice any difference in my workout with one scoop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did i notice a difference with two scoops....\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this supposed to make you feel pumped? \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not going to buy this again.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it tastes great...witch is useless because it didn't do anything or affect me in any way. i was disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the best pre-w I've tried!\n",
      "I love this product! It has increase workout's intensity and duration. It really helps get in a great workout after a long day at work. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried samples of quite a few of these pre's and C4 is the one I chose.  I have a high tolerance for stimulants so it doesn't really kick me into high gear to start...but it makes me not want to quit.  I used to be able to get my workouts done in 45-60 minutes but now even after 60 minutes i feel like i have so much more to give.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the wife said the same thing when she tried it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't get much of a pump out of it, but the beta alanine tingles are pretty cool and \"the burn\" feeling at the end of a set is definitely buffered.  Recovery between sets is also much better after taking C4 than it is when i dont take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best Pre i've tried for pumps was PumpHD.  Next on my list to try is MP Assault.\n",
      "Mojito flavor is gross.  Comparable to someone else's toothpaste spit.  Glad I did the multiple-flavor sample pack (BB.com's best idea EVER) and didn't buy a whole tub.  Product performance is still the best, love me some C4... but stay away from the mojito....\n",
      "Good Product.\n",
      "The 30 servings container of this stuff could literally be half the size and it would still fit all the powder just fine.  Seriously, what a waste of space.\n",
      "This is a pretty good preworkout. The flavors are usually great and it has a good amount of caffein to get me going. The only issue I've had has been with mix ability and I usually get clumps at the bottom which taste horrible. This preworkout is up there with assault being my current favorite but because of the stack that is offered here (3 proteins and preworkout) it is hard to pass it up. \n",
      "C4 has a great taste, it's similar to Kool-aid. This is my fav pre. My roommates had used Assault and Jacked before so I told them to try C4 and now they would never use anything but C4.  Just the right amount of energy to keep me pumped through my workout but no jitters or crash. Highly recommend\n",
      "I've tried a variety of pre-workouts and the one I keep coming back to is Cellucor's C4 Extreme.  My favorite flavor, orange, is to die for.  C4 Extreme gives me the additional \"get up and go\" I need to power through workouts without any of the tingles or strange feelings some pre-workouts can give.  The cost is comparable and competitive with other workouts but the taste and its effectiveness make it a home-run.  \n",
      "I definitely like C4 if for nothing else but the taste and price. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's look at price. The number of servings one gets for the amount paid make this product one of the most competitive in the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, C4 has some truly awesome flavors. The Watermelon, Strawberry Margarita (I would rate it 11 out of 10 if I could), & Mojito are probably the three best tasting pre-workout supplements I have ever tried. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, not everything I have to say about C4 is positive. I have three observations relative to other products. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. The thermogenic effect is lacking compared to Jack3D. \n",
      "2. My pumps are better w/NO XPLODE. Every single one of my friends says that I am lying when I make this statement, but I speak the truth. \n",
      "3. I quickly had to start dosing up. After 1 week, I was already on 1.5-2 scoops. With any other product, months would pass before I would need to up my dosage. Dosing up so quickly changes the cost basis for buying C4, which I cite as one of the main 2 reasons why I like the product. \n",
      "\n",
      "All-in-all, a quality product from a company that is really making a name for itself. If for nothing else other than price and taste, this product is a must have.  \n",
      "Tastes great! BUT probably my least favorite of pre workouts I have had as far as performance. I didnt get a great pump, and my energy wasnt as high as I thought other pre's had done. \n",
      "I love C4 :) Always gives me a great pump and makes me feel stronger every time I work out. Taking a full scoop for me, makes me SO tingly, but I like that because it lets me know it's kicking in! \n",
      "I LOVE this stuff! I can feel it when it kicks in. I notice a difference in my workouts when I forget to drink it. I've tried other brands and this is my favorite so far!\n",
      "My use of this product started when I got it on sale at a local bulk store. It was a hit in my supplementing from the first scoop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have slowly increased my scoops up to 2 and very rarely 2 1/2. It works great no matter how much. Depending on the workout I will adjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife also enjoys the product and especially the Watermelon. She says that it tastes like Jolly Rancher candy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will continue to buy it. Keep the buy 2 get the 3rd free specials!\n",
      "Pineapple was ****ght. It had this tangy sweet flavor that was good, but wasn't my favorite. It still provided the kick that I needed for the workouts. If you like pineapple, this flavor is definitely worth the try. I've tried various flavors, and they all provide the same amount of potency that a preworkout needs. \n",
      "Very good pre-workout. I've tried several that have been recommended to me, and I just love the whole Cellucor line-up. It mixes well, and doesn't leave me feeling jittery after my workout like some others have. I would highly recommend this pre-workout. When taking it I generally stack it with Cellucor's P6. \n",
      "C4 is my second favorite preworkout, but Icy Blue Razz is hands down the best tasting preworkout I've ever tasted. By leaps and bounds. I'm one of those people that loves getting the burn from preworkout and C4 does it, but I feel like I get used to C4 real quick, so I usually only buy 30 serving tubs and switch to something else then come back to C4 later. Great preworkout\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like my C4. I'm very focused and energetic, and I don't get the jitters! I like that it doesn't upset my stomach or make me feel weird either. I like the Icy Blue Raz n just ordered the watermelon so when it comes in I'll write a review for that. I would recommend C4 to anyone!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Strawberry Margarita is a better tasting mix, overall I was not very impressed.  I heard alot of hype for this and maybe was expecting more. I feel in love with Alarm pwo and haven't found much that hit me the same. I was up to 2 scoops in the 1st few days. I did get some needed energy and felt alive walking into the gym but that did not last. I normally put in about 2 hrs and felt as if this was wearing off 45 min in. I have not tried to go for more than 2 scoops and I dont think you should need to.  I have 1/2 jar out of 2 left and I use it maybe for cardio days. It might hit you differently, the price was good at by one get one 50 off. \n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased this after speaking with an absolutely amazing guy who works for bodyduilding.com. He said the Watermelon flavor tastes just like a Watermelon Jolly Rancher and he was dead on for that. While I'm not a huge fan of the super tingling I get in my hands and face I do notice I dominate my workouts so much better now, making new PRs each week. It also comes in handy on non training days when I am chasing my 3 kids around. Gives great energy! \n",
      "\n",
      "Pink lemonade is the bomb.com!! Especially come summertime it's so yummy to drink on the way to the gym on a hot day :) gives me a tingle in my hands but not too much that I fear moving heavy weights haha\n",
      "I've taken C4 for at least a year. It's the best pre-workout sup that I've tried, and I've tried a lot. I'm always looking for something better.  I read ratings and reviews trying to find the magic.  If anyone knows one that is better. Let me hear it. I'm always open to try a new up and coming pre-workout product. But for now C4 is the shizz.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best pre workout supplements. The ingredients are amazing and probably the best combo on the market. Beta alanine, creatine and caffeine (there are others but those are main ones ). . It is simple but does the trick. I usually work out at 0500 every morning, and this helps me get from the bed to the gym with a boost of energy.  Mixes well tastes great. Highly recommend. \n",
      "In general I like pre-workouts with creatine in them, this product however has creatine nitrate in. This is definitely one of my favorites ever, do give me a good swell in the gym, great tasting and gives one that tingling feeling after you consumed it. Must say this product works best for me on a empty stomach and even if i drink it a few hours after small meal the effects aren't as good, so I opt to avoid meals before and rather grab a few bananas right before I go to the gym. Overall love it and will buy it again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Favorite. Pre workout. Ever. Great taste and works every time, I have nothing other to say but TRY IT I'm not sure how anyone could be disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The icy blue razz tasted like a blue jolly rancher, which was a pretty good taste. I tried one scoop the first time like the directions says to, then tried two scoops my next workout. However, I didn't notice a change. It did however make me extremely itchy and irritable. As for concentration and helping me through my workout, I can't say it did a whole lot for me. I gave it four tries before finally realizing it just wasn't working for me.. honestly I couldn't stand how itchy it made me anyways.\n",
      "Tastes awesome like Strawberry KoolAid. Provides energy. Will keep buying. \n",
      "Bought this at a local store. Selaed and original product and did not a single thing for me. Horrible crash after only 30 mins. :/. Wouldnt buy again. \n",
      "Honestly, I didn't feel like it did anything at all. I waited to take the entire bottle before writing this review. Tastes great, but never felt a single effect. I don't like that \"cracked-out\" feeling you get on some of them, so I was geared toward this, but I felt as if it wasn't doing anything at all. Will not be re-ordering. I don't recommend this product if you want any energy, focus, quality creatine, etc. in a pre workout. \n",
      "This is my first time using C-4 and I love it great energy the flavor is good and I can lift more when I take it\n",
      "\n",
      "C4 has been and still is top notch!  It has yet to let me down. My recommendation for first-time users is to try the green apple. The flavor is one of the best I've tasted out of any product.\n",
      "\n",
      "The icy blue razz tastes amazing. No complaint about that. This was the first PWO I've used, and it worked well for the first couple weeks but since then it hasn't had much of an effect. Will probably try something else after I finish this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this stuff. Feel great after drinking it and the flavors are amazingly delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "best pre-workout by far\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a good product. I get the tingly feeling in my face when I first started using it but it wears off over time. I only use one heaping scoop as of right now but I may go to two scoops in future. It also helps me get to the gym on days where I don't feel like working out. If your still skeptically buy the 5 serving first like I did to try it out. I recommend this product....it's a good buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty awesome, I didn't want to try this initially because everybody uses it and I don't really like \"popular\" products that much, but I'm pleasantly surprised.  Nice little niacin flush, good amount of caffeine, AKG, betaine, bit of creatine.  Awesome pumps, solid pre workout all around.  Also tastes AMAZING, especially with juice.\n",
      "I have used about every pre workout on the market and nothing compares to C4. Great flavors, the pump i get is amazing. Small serving size is key to not having any stomach issues after taking.  Great product. Thanks cellucor team\n",
      "I've tried almost every flavor and have to say Pink Lemonade is my favorite, with Watermelon coming in a close second. Mojito and Green Apple are also very good. Icy Blue Razz is also very good (try mixing it with Alpha Amino Icy Blue Razz). I'm not crazy about the Fruit Punch (it's not bad, but I will never buy it again. I tried the Orange and was not impressed, and the Pineapple was so bad I took it back for a refund. C4 is a very good PWO. I have to take 2-4 scoops (high tolerance). I actually really like C4 as an energy drink replacement too. I work night shift, and I use to go through several energy drinks and coffees a night. C4 keeps me focused and awake at work and at the gym. I like how the scoops are very small. It makes mixing a lot easier. C4 is currently my favorite PWO. My second favorite PWO is MusclePharm's Assault.\n",
      "This stuff works! I start feeling the all to familiar tingle/ich after only 15 mins and I feel kind of \"primed\" when I start my workout.  One time I decided to workout without taking the C4 just to see if there was a difference...yeah, there was a difference.  I just didnt feel up for it and my muscles felt the same.  Flavor wise, orange is the best!! Strawberry Margarita was overly sweet for me and the Mojito had an off taste to it, but both were OK. \n",
      "Love C4 so far, definitely helps with my workouts giving me a nice boost to get those extra reps and providing a good amount of energy. I usually take 1 1/2 to 2 scoops 20 minutes before my workout. Wasn't too crazy about the Icy Blue Razz flavor, but it's drinkable and I would like to try their other flavors. No negative side effects so far and feel great, I'd highly recommend it. \n",
      "I've tried just about all the flavors of c4 and I have to say I love their \n",
      "products. I would suggest that you stack it with the NO3 to get that added pump. Out of all the pre-workouts I've tried (and I've tried a ton) c4 is by far the best tasting and most effective pre-workout available. I could never find one that actually taste good AND was effective, until i found c4. If you haven't tried it yet...do it!! you'll be glad you did.\n",
      "taste good, work well.\n",
      "\n",
      "and try this fitness tracker: igg.me/at/GYMWATCHcom/x/7148303\n",
      "Been off PWO for about a few weeks now and today was my first day back on because my tub of C4 came in the mail.  The last time I took C4 was when they had a different blend of ingredients.  This new blend seemed just ok.  Took 1 scoop since it was my first day back and was looking forward to the beta alanine tingles.  However I felt nothing, only a little more focused.  Pump was nothing spectacular either.  I will try 2 scoops tomorrow.\n",
      "First review I been using c4 on and off I tried other pres but I always go back to c4 to me it's the best pre on the market. Taste is great with each flavor I tried takes about 15 mins to kick in and once it does the feeling is epic I stack it with No3 cromes for optimal results  would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great pre workout supplement \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm disappointed with cellucor. This stuff got lots of hype, but I had to take over two scoops (nearly 300 mg of caffeine) to feel anything. I didn't get pumped up, did not get tons of energy, and I felt no real difference in my training. Off to find another pre workout. To be fair, this works great for some people. I may just not respond well to the ingredients.\n",
      "Best pre I've tried aside from the original Jack3d and Craze(R.I.P.). Didn't upset stomach.\n",
      "By far best pre workout I've taken. \n",
      "It doesn't give me the insane pumped up rage feeling that I get from stuff like Jack3d, but it seems to do a better job of prolonging my heightened energy level throughout my entire workout (which often runs rather long). Also, it mixes well, and the Fruit Punch flavor tastes decent enough. \n",
      "Keeps me focused and helps with pushing out a few more reps. The fruit punch flavor is good and makes it easy to drink with minimal water.\n",
      "Excellent. Gets me hyped to workout. Just simply great. \n",
      "When I first tried c4 I was blown away at the way it made me feel (like super woman)....but I think I've developed a tolerance to it. Not to mention the flavor has turned me off. The ratings for strawberry margarita were so good/high but I was seriously disappointed. It is so sweet and artificial (chemical) tasting that I have to chug it down (and still shudder). \n",
      "\n",
      "Green apple was better. More crisp and fresh but over time ur has been leaving an after taste in my mouth that is undesirable. \n",
      "\n",
      "So far pink lemonade has lived up as truest in flavor and the one I have enjoyed the most. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do need to switch it up and try something else.....any suggestions?\n",
      "C4 is one of the best pre workout that i've tried. Good energy with great flavor.\n",
      "I've tried countless pw's and none come close. Adding C4 to my routine allows me to get that little extra outta every workout. The profile is great as it covers the beta alanine, creatine, and arginine for gains in strength and endurance. And is low on the stims with a little caffeine, among a few other ingredients. Other preworkouts that go heavy on the stims get me all jumpy and the crash is horrible.  And for the flavors, cellucor does it the best. The Strawberry Margarita is my favorite, but there's really no wrong choice, all up to you. HIGHLY recommend C4 Extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \t\n",
      "Great product, took on a heavy workout Sina and legs still lose weight and diet low in carbohydrates. This product gave strength and endurance at the end of training it was rather tired =)\n",
      "This stuff is the AK-47 of PWOs, it is hard to beat the flavor, effectiveness, cost and versatility of this PWO, It has tons of pumps, lots of energy, doesn't crash, and it is just as effective on lift day, as swimming days, or core days, or boxing days. If I try a new routine, C4 is the PWO I reach for. It is not as effective on lifting days as Iron Pump for me though.\n",
      "I have gotten a Sample pack from my order of Whey, and this tasted absolutely strange. It was like a sour patch kids in liquid form! But overall it was Creatine and completely different then Chocolate Whey. It \"did\" give me a boost when your 10 mins in your work out though. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried using many different PWO's and none of them compare to C4. The energy is unbeatable and the flavor is unmatched. Not only that but with a little bit of creatine in every scoop as well as Beta-alanine, their ingredients are top notch. Cellucor truly is the best. \n",
      "I LOVE how C4 comes in a 5g dose - that way I don't feel like I have to drink a gallon of water just to get my pre-workout down. The flavor is not overwhelming like some pre-workouts I have tried. I get a good pump and don't feel the jitters - just focus. I used N.O.xplode for years until I tried C4 - now I'll never go back! My favorite flavor is Mojito!\n",
      "GREAT product. If you're looking for a huge tingle affect i would buy some beta-alanine and mix in with it. Not a huge tingle fan so I enjoyed it. Taste is amazing, pump is awesome. There is a little tingle, just not enough for some people. Will continue to buy this product. Only downfall is theres a lot of caffeine which is a diuretic, so don't take it anytime close to bed time. You will pee all night.\n",
      "I've used the Icy Blue Razz and Majito. The product works great. Icy Blue Razz has a good taste to it but Majito is HORRIBLE and a big waste of money so don't try that flavor it;s got a high taste rating but it's bogus. I'll stick with Icy Blue Razz for now on.\n",
      "So I tried this product after using Muscle Pharm Assault for the past 18 months just to switch it up. I wasn't too excited to try a pre workout that was all about the caffeine, but I gave it a try. I did the Blue Razz and the Strawberry Margarita, both flavors are very tasty ( A little sweet for me with their suggested water serving size so I added a little bit more water). I started out with their suggested 1 scoop and I didn't feel anything at all during my workout. So next day I tried two scoops and still didn't feel any extra jolt of energy that I would expect from a pre workout supplement, especially like one that I was used to from the Assault. I feel much more of a boost of energy from a cup of coffee then I did from this product. I will be finishing off what I bought and then not using this product anymore.\n",
      "My training partner was like what the **** for the first 3 weeks then he was like what. Happen I said I don't know but I'm going back to coffee I've always been natural and I like working out like some. Like. Sex \n",
      "this product is awesome. it doesn't get you all jittery like no explode and it tastes great too....it mixes well with all liquids and really gives you a workout boost. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only pre workout mix that doesn't make my heart race and jittery. I love this stuff!\n",
      "I have tried nearly every flavor of Cellucor's C4 and very single one tastes incredible. However, taste is not as important as performance, and it does not let you down. You feel it kick in when the niacin tingles hit your face and arms and from that point on you're off to the races. It gives a great lasting boost in energy, a sense of \"tunnel vision\" on your workout from the intense focus it gives you and finally the pump which is phenomenal thanks to the NO3. This product is fantastic, the only drawback being that it costs money...\n",
      "\n",
      "Great flavor. Surprised me as to how well it tastes.  Would recommend\n",
      "I am religious about pre-workout, and the C4 fits the bill! And holy cow...the Mojito flavor is baller! If they discontinue it at any point in my lifetime I will be very sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff works great. It's great for getting energy before a work out and it mixes very easily. I've taken this compared to an off brand pre-work out, and C4 is easily superior. It seems to last longer, taste better, and as long as you mix it with enough water you won't crap your trousers. \n",
      "I love C4! The main ingredient is listed as creatine, but it has a bunch of beta alanine which is really up and coming in Sports Nutrition, so you're getting 2 for 1. Strawberry Margarita and Mojito are my favorites, but the other favors are good - they can just be a bit strong/overwhelming, but you're drinking it for the benefits not the flavor. This is an awesome product!\n",
      "nice flavor and good pump \n",
      "I've tried quite a few flavors of C4, my least favorite being the Icy Blue Razz, it was way to sweet and artificial and having bought a 60serving, it was way too much. I ordered the Mojito and it tastes like something out of a dentists office, i would not recomend. I tried pinapple before, that flavor was pretty good, tastes like a redbull. but if you are going for flavor, Watermellon and Pink Lemonaid are both amazing. Watermellon tastes like a Jolly Rancher and Pink Lemonaid is spot on. this product is a great boost of energy, I would not recomend taking it for only cardio though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gotta say, i started with 2 scoops straight away, no messing around. this is the 3rd PWO i am sampling looking for a replacement for my current one. of the 3 i have tried so far this is the best, of any i have used before this is head & shoulders above the rest. This stuff is mind blowing! But not in a abnormal way, its just like a massive energy rush, with kick *** power. The overall energy during my workout is so intense, its not just the energy to continue set after set, it is the energy to keep adding weight. Its not a pump in the traditional sense, but you just keep wanting more out of your set. This is it for me, i've seen enough! C4 Extreme consider yourself added to my stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I can say is the effect of this product is moderate. \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste go good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gives slight pump and energy..... Check my video on the product by searching for Arabian Juggernaut on youtube.\n",
      "This Is a good product, good mix and good taste. I think this taste Is like babaloo! I like too much, remember me whey i was a Child. Well, C4 give a big Pump and U can train hard whit this. I can fell My blocos become hot when i think the first time. I like a lot!\n",
      "I've tried pretty much every flavor but orange and the new mojito flavor.  Strawberry Margarita, Mystery flavor and the Green Apple are my favs.  This stuff delivers a good workout for me.  I stay focused and wanting to push through my training sessions.  I haven't really strayed from C4 in about 3 years now.  Love it!  I throw in a little agmatine or will stack with Hemavol if I want some insane pumps \n",
      "Taken 20-30 minutes prior gave me ton of energy to power through my workout. The flavor is great! If you don't like to feel the tingle then this product isn't for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Got a sample of Icy Blue Raz and product tasted okay and gave me great energy so I ordered 30 servings of the mystery flavor. I now know what it is, pineapple infused bird ****. Product still does a great job but this flavor is grueling and bitter. Get any flavor but mystery!!!\n",
      "Overall it was good at first, I felt as though I didn't want to stop lifting. Now I think I may have gotten \"used\" to it. Not much of a reaction even with 1 1/2 - 2 scoops. Mojito was best tasting flavor by far.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been taking pre-workouts for a little over 10 years, and these have (by far) been the best tasting, and the energy was great by itself (I've found I've had to stack with others to get the same effect I received from C4). I would highly recommend C4 to someone who is looking for that extra push on the weights or cardio (or both).\n",
      "I LOVE this pre-workout. It tastes SO good, a little sweet, a little sour, and I love the all-over tingling feeling I get from it. It definitely gives me a boost to get my workout started and to get through it. Highly recommend! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is great but this product is weak. I had to double up on the dose to get any effect. I take that back I felt the beta Alanine but that was it.\n",
      "By far the worst pre-workout supplement I have taken. No pump what so ever I took 1 scoop the recommended amount with 6oz. of water didn't even feel a single thing. Very disappointed in the product, I think its not worth the money at all. My friends were even wondering what my problem was usually I am killing the weights but C4 is just drinking a terrible supplement. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried several preworkouts in the past couple years and C4 is at the top of the list so far. It gives me the pump I need in a short period of time while lasting throughout my entire workout. It doesn't give me the upset stomach feeling several other preworkouts do. I also recommend stacking it with other products by this company. Keep up the good work Cellucor!\n",
      "I get a great pump from this product. I definitely notice that I feel stronger and can workout longer. Watermelon is one of the best flavors of any preworkout or other supplement that I've ever tried. \n",
      "Definitely tingly when it kicks in. Other than a little added focus and energy, I feel like I don't get too much out of this. At least the taste and mixability are there!\n",
      "So vascular! My blood flow is intense on this. The tingling a lot but, fun.  Works really well. Make sure you drink your water. \n",
      "I chose the Fruit Punch. Weird after taste but its yummy. I still look forward to it.\n",
      "My favorite preworkout so far! I have taken C4 several times and have yet to find anything that is as good. All flavors are good but fruit punch is my favorite.. Tastes exactly like kool-aid to me. Gives good energy in the gym but doesn't make me feel cracked out like some other preworkout I have taken. Overall very good product! \n",
      "I have tried a lot of different pre-workouts and this is by far my favorite! Tastes awesome and really gets you ready to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best I have tasted and it works great\n",
      "Great pre-workout. I take it stacked with P6. Within about 20 minutes I am ready to go to the gym and just start lifting everything I see. Chairs, bags, desks, smaller guys, you name it. It's almost hard to pace myself in between sets. I think I saw another guy post it as well, but as soon as Im done with a set, I just want to immediately go to the next. REST? RECOVERY? WHAT THE F IS THAT?!\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I've seen people mention they dont like the tingling feeling they get when they take it. I dont mind it, but it does start to itch my face if I start to do super sets. If you're going to take a pre-workout... expect to be feeling the effects of something that gives you extreme energy.\n",
      "The taste is exceptional and mixes smoothly. I enjoy the pump and energy it gives me... I do feel like it they have changed the product a little bit though cause the \"tingle\" isn't as bad as it use to be. That's not always bad though. I would definitely recommend this product... Toss up between C4, Assault, & Alarm Ultra as far as which is my favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry for everybody who likes c4 but i am not a fan.  Everybody is different when it comes to supps and for me c4 didnt do a **** thing.  I bought a container and tried it 3 times for 3 different workout routines and was let down every time so I went back to my favorite which is \"PRE JYM\".  Give it a try and see the difference\n",
      "\n",
      "I love using C4! Gives me that kick I need to help improve my workout. The flavors I've tried so far are all pretty good (pink lemonade, orange, watermelon). Pink lemonade is the best to me so far, the watermelon tasted like a jolly rancher but after a week I kind of got tired of that flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "By far my favorite pre. Have been taking it for years (with breaks of course) and plan to continue! \n",
      "\n",
      "This is not only the best pre-workout supplement I've ever taken, but it is the only pre-workout I'll take. I take it every session and it gives me an awesome pump, extreme energy, and it even increase my strength and endurance. If you haven't tried it, you definitely need to check it out!\n",
      "Its ok, but there are much better pre-works and cheaper.\n",
      "Well this is probably my favorite Pre-Workout ever! \n",
      "I like how it's dosed, you can either up the scoops, when you need to, or just take 1 serving on days you feel good! I can take this after school and go to the gym while still being able to sleep at night. It even helps me while studying for school since I'm more focused :D \n",
      "Then there is the flavor... this is probably the best tasting Supplement ever, my favorite Flavors are Icy Blue Razz and Mojito! \n",
      "Overall I have to say that I'm in love with this stuff! And it's from my favorite Supplement company too! Cellucor thank you for such amazing products!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dose  what it needs  to do .... totally recommend it ! \n",
      "Taste great and felt it right away. I usually have a high tolerance to caffiene so i need something with a little more punch. I used to take the old Jack3d, although this isnt as effective still pretty close. \n",
      "I've been lifting and taking supplements for 6 years now and this is the best pre workout I've ever tasted and used to pump me up and to stay motivated. \n",
      "Works almost instantly, great workouts, i take this with no3 chrome, excellent!\n",
      "gets the job done!\n",
      "I love C4, I hate to work out without it. It tastes great, and the tingle feels like electricity going through my skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orange flavor was really good. Got me energized and pumped without any crash or going over the top.  When using two topped out scoops or so in a water bottle of about 20 ounces, I felt pins and needles feeling in my lips and face. Was not a big deal really, but an odd feeling that let me know I had mixed more than enough powder in. Just ordered another can. I have begun mixing a scoop of it in with Super pump max and like that combo better than either alone. \n",
      "Waste of money. Tried C4 a while back and got nothing from it. heard the formula was improved, still nothing. I let some friends try it out, they agreed. no nothing from the product. Fool me once, shame on me. I fell for the improved version, never again.  \n",
      "\n",
      "idk what all these ppl are talking about i had to take 3 scoops just to feel anything. Maybe its just cuz im too beast need something more intense. i give this product a 5 sorry \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the first pre workout that I ever purchased.  Immediately I felt the effects of the beta alanine (tingles were insane at times) and the energy from the caffeine.  This product didn't give me much of a pump, but helped in terms of energy and endurance.  I would have to agree that this product is one of the best pre workouts on the market.\n",
      "Love C4. Tastes great, get energy from it and my workouts are noticeably better when I take it. Also love how cellucor puts everything that is in it on the label. I know how much creatine, beta alananie, arginine and caffeine I'm taking. I do 2 scoops on cardio days, 3 when I'm lifting.\n",
      "\n",
      "good product\n",
      "Pink lemonade is AMAZING, I've found Icy Blue Razz to taste too sugary for me, but that's just personal preference. I got an amazing deal and decided it was worth trying. MUST take on an empty stomach, or effects are minimal. I feel tingly and pumped up, and I'm still able to go through the rest of the day with plenty of energy. It's awesome to stroll into the \"man cave\" at my gym at school and work in with the huge football players. They're shocked when a 5'2'' girl can hold her own! \n",
      "Great Pre-workout and great taste.\n",
      "tastes like a watermelon jolly rancher, , it definitely gave me a extra pump in the gym, this is one of those jittery face all tingly type of pre workout so if your into those kind then i would recommend this product for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great flavor. Great lifts and workouts. Keeps me in a great mindset. Good product overall.\n",
      "Love this pre-workout. Gives you that kick just at the right time to keep pushing through the sets. Icy Blue Razz is defiantly my favorite flavor, it might be a little to sweet for some peoples taste though. Orange is good compared to most pre-workout flavors, but after repeated use, just like anything, it gets old. I always go back and forth between flavors so things don't get too old to fast. This product has a good kick to get the job done in the gym though, give it a try!\n",
      "Hands down my favorite pre-workout. I've been using C4 for about 6 months and I still can tell a difference in my workouts when I don't use it. Watermelon, Orange, and Icy Blue Razz taste amazing. I wouldn't recommend Strawberry Margarita; it was way too sweet, even after adding more than the recommended amount of water.\n",
      "My all-time favorite pre-workout. 15-20 minutes after ingesting, I get a serious power surge that gets me through my workout from start to finish. Best product I have used and have been using this for about a year. The only downside is that I take this later in the evening before my routine, so it's harder to go to bed within four hours of consuming. \n",
      "Best PWO I have ever used. Felt awesome at the gym, more specifically energized but not jittery. Everybody who recommended c4 to me was right, considering they felt the same about it. Pineapple flavor is awesome, too, since it is smooth and doesn't burn at all like other PWOs I have tried. Almost tastes like smarties candy. Definitely recommended to anyone wanting to either try something new or make quality strength gains.\n",
      "Awesome preworkout.  Started by taking one scoop which usually doesn't work for me with any preworkout anyways.  But then took two scoops and HOLY S@#$ I was pumped up my energy was through the roof and I didn't feel a crash afterwards.  Take it before my hockey games and I can tell I don't get as tired when I take it for my games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great pre workout, but not my favorite. In order to get the same effect as other preworkouts, you need to take two scoops. So it burns up your supply of C4 a little bit quicker making it more costly. However it's often on sale.\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed this product, it had amazing pumps energy and focus, the flavor was also awesome. The only bad thing I can say about this product is that after a week or so I found mysel needing more then one scoop to have the great effects, but at the good sale prices it balances out. I would recomend this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried about a dozen of these pre-boosters and C4 is my favorite.  As a very, very amateur fitness-minded guy, I need something to give me a good lift w/o a nasty crash afterwards.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is very good but lets face it, that's just not that important compared to performance.   If it it, well then you are in luck - this tastes great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the mild rush from this product vs. some feeling like i'm going to explode or nothing at all.  Good blood rush with C4, it helps get me pumped for a good workout and unquestionably I have great workouts with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it the 'best'?   Hell if I know, but I'll tell you that it works great, tastes good & doesn't give me any crash afterwards like some pure-caffeine pre's.  I'm hooked.\n",
      "My favorite pre-workout without a doubt. The new Watermelon is the best, takes just like a jolly rancher.\n",
      "Overall, a pretty good preworkout for me. The first two weeks were very intense, but a tolerance built up quickly. Still works well enough and still satisfied.\n",
      "I liked this product a lot for the first few weeks i was on it! best tasting preworkout i've ever tried, gave me a good pump, and got into my system fast. But after the first few weeks it lost its kick! It stopped working on me and i didnt feel that nice tingling sensation anymore\n",
      "I was told to use this product and haven't looked back.  It helps me focus on what I'm working on that day and maintain some type of energy.\n",
      "The taste of the Icy Blue Razz is amazing. However the effect I had with the C4 is a little disappointing, I've tried the product twice and both times, I felt nauseated, my heart beating extremely quickly but other than that, I didn't feel any of the pump or concentration that was promised... \n",
      "I personally am not caffeine tolerant a cup of coffee is enough to get me bouncing off the walls, perhaps that maybe an explanation for the crummy feeling I get.\n",
      "best pre workout ever i used and the taste is perfect i used watermelon and pink lemon and they are pretty awesome \n",
      "\n",
      "Pink Lemonade was surprisingly delicious if I were to recommend a flavor it would be Pink Lemonade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality of the product is quite nice Although I started to feel the pumps getting weaker over the course of the month. Still a very good product but I still trying products to find the one suited for me.\n",
      "Best pre-workout I've ever tried. I recommend it to everyone I know. It tastes great, the powder mixes up really well, and the flavors are delicious. I've had icy blue razz and pink lemonade. I only like PW's that have beta alinine, so that's a main reason I like C4. I love the tingley feeling you get when you take it. AWESOME PRODUCT!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm using this product a few weeks now and I find it very weak to my expectation. I'm already thinking of abusing the dose to see if it will really take some power into my workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome pre-workout drink.  Don't use full dose of the bat......  build to it.\n",
      "It makes my face itch, which is when I know it is working through my system. I feel like I can lift heavier weight when I drink this pre-workout. I sometimes str****le through workouts without it. I recently tried the green apple flavor - the green apple taste is very, very strong. The after taste tastes like a diaper full of urine. I'm not trying to exaggerate or be mean when I say that either. I always order Icy Blue Razz. You can never go wrong with that flavor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I've never used any other preworkout, so I can't say if there's something better out there, but this stuff does the job. I walk about one mile to get to my gym and I'll take one scoop before I leave. It's fully kicked in by the time I get into the gym. My hands and face will feel a little itchy for about 10 minutes while I'm walking there, but it goes away as soon as I arrive. No jitters either and I'm sensitive to caffeine. Decent flavor. I'll probably buy it again, but I do want to explore other brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pre-workout is definitely the best i've tried so far, I have tried others but they just don't match up to this. \n",
      "Awesome pre-workout, coffee doesn't even come close to this!!!\n",
      "Gives you amazing pumps if you know when to take it (10-20 min before), anytime after that it doesn't work. \n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I give it a 9 and not a 10 is because for real pumps you need 2 scops after using it long enough and the WORSE it doesn't ship to Canada anymore!!!! WTH!!!!\n",
      "Not a huge fan of this, compared to other preworkouts I've taken. Got pretty decent pumps, but the drive, energy and focus didn't last long at all. I'd get halfway through my workout and be burned out. I was really looking forward to it from all the good reviews. Oh well. Would take neurocore instead, wanting to try Presurge next though!\n",
      "I like the fact that it doesn't fizz up and get me bloated unlike NO-xplode.  I take about a scoop and a half with no jitters, but I really want to do stuff when I take it.  I usually take it about 15 mins before the gym, and at least 30 mins after my protein shake.  Recommend that you take it when your fully hydrated.  I took it once after a couple of  drinks the night before and that was not a good idea.  \n",
      "doesn't work for me. I prefer assault \n",
      "Strawberry margarita is a Fantastic flavor, profile is great, and energy is insane!  Focus is probably the best thing about this, it's intense at 2 scoops, which is my normal dose.  Will buy again!\n",
      "I started taking the C4 cause my wife recommended it.  I tried the fruit punch and the watermelon and they didn't work for me. The fruit punch was a little tart but ok and the watermelon tasted like a jolly rancher and I am not a fan of jolly ranchers. I got the pink lemonade for free when I got the special from Cellucor, so the price was great and the taste even better. I got to the gym in the early mornings and don't like things too strong. Great product and I would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "This was an amazing product. I took it 15-20 min before my workout and I still had energy after running 2.5 miles and doing a 30 min leg workout.  Definetly worth the money.\n",
      "One of the best pre-workouts on the market. Good pumps, Great energy, Amazing Flavor. +1 Cellucor\n",
      "\n",
      "I usually don't rate any product at a 10 but I have to for this. I take this 15 minutes before working out just as I start pumping some water and getting changed into workout clothes. I had tested it in the blue razz when I first started because I wanted to find a pre-workout that gave me the \"kick butt\" pump I need after long work days and early mornings. I had three other pre-workout testers that I worked with each at a week at a time and none came close. 10 minutes into this my lips, arms, etc are tingling. I'm usually bouncing more than walking to get into my workout. The energy last for quite awhile and the best part is you feel like doing more and bigger reps as you progress. Amazing product...!\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I've tried three of the flavors, and it tastes like candy. It's amazing. It's a joy to drink, mixes and goes down easy. But the effect is amazing. If you down the whole glass, you'll feel it in like 5 min. Once your body gets used to it, it'll take like 15 min to kick in. It gives you such a great amount of energy, it doesn't make you wanna throw up during or after your workout, and it gives you a crazy pump at those last reps that you normally wouldn't do. By far the best preworkout I've every had.\n",
      "Tastes really good, gives you great focus and good energy. The first time i tried it i used 1 scoop and i felt it in just 5minutes, was really amazed, then i build up tolerance and by the end of the bottle i was using 2 scoops and feeling little efect, eventhough its a good pre\n",
      "Ive been using this for a couple months now and its the most dependable pre that I've ever used. Its a very clean energy boost and brings a pretty decent pump. It does become less effective as you become tolerant. i would recommend this over any brand and it comes at a reasonable price. \n",
      "Tried it for 8 weeks, did 1 scoop for the first 3 weeks then 2 scoops for the remaining weeks. Product is overrated ! \n",
      "So to keep this short and sweet: Ive been using this a little more than 2 weeks now and love it. The taste is spot and it give me more than enough boost to last my workout! I would highly suggest trying this product but start slow...it works!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried many different types of pre-workouts and I can say that C4 gives me the most energy! So far Icy Blue Razz is my favorite and I have tried nearly all the flavors.\n",
      "Solid pwo. Good energy and focus. Didn't really feel the pump as much as I would have liked to, even though I was taking 2 servings. Tastes great, but taste really doesn't matter all that much to me. to be honest, I'm probly not gonna use what I have left until my tsn pump igniter is gone. \n",
      "I have tried this product out over the last month. It has been everything I could want out of a pre workout. It has a decent build up time before you start  aching to throw some weights around. The taste is kinda soft on the watermelon. But the strawberry margarita is amazing!  It also keeps you pump throughout 1 hr workouts. going to be sticking with it his product for long time\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the most effective pre-workouts I have ever taken. It taste decent and delivers incredible pumps and energy. The absolute only down side, if you'd call it that is the slight tingling sensation you experience shortly after taking C4 Extreme. The sensation doesn't last long and for me intensifies the sense of being energetic because the niacin in the product acts as a thermogenic. \n",
      "One of the best tasting products IÂ´ve ever tasted! This flavour is awesome! I also tried the Pink lemonade, and it wasÂ´t even close! As for the product effects, everytime i take it( and i do not take it on every workout), I feel this weird tingling on my face. But it kinda feels good. Get my motors running. Personally it works great for me, I never used any others pre-workouts, so I can not give a real good testimony about the effects, but as I am on a strict diet the great taste is one of the high moments of my day. \n",
      "A very good pre-workout.\n",
      "If you are a woman and are looking to try this, i would start off taking half a scoop to see how your body responds to this.  I can literally feel in my body as I'm working out which slightly freaks me out sometimes.  The taste is great but just be careful with the servings!\n",
      "\n",
      "The pump is unreal. If you want to become the Hulk for an hour here is your chance. Id give it 10/10 if your tolerance wasnt build up so quickly. But that depends on who you are. I take 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 scoops before training. Makes you tingly and pretty much makes you get off your *** and do something, which I like. Awesome pre\n",
      "This is BY FAR the best product if you want a good pre-workout boost and if you want to make great gains. It just keeps you going the entire time. I love the stuff.  Also I tend to work out late at night and it doesn't keep me awake and I do not get the shakes or jitters. That's the great thing about this product. Plus it tastes amazing. If you haven't tried this product yet, then you should. You're missing out. \n",
      "Pretty good product, only thing for me is that the pump doesnt last as long as i need it to\n",
      "My favorite pre-workout supplement, so far.  Gets the motor going, before I hit the gym door.  It does give me a pretty strong skin buzz, but not so bad as to be uncomfortable.  Good taste.  A pre-workout does not help me, if I gag just trying to gt the stuff down.  The strawberry margarita flavor is reallyquite good.  I will try others.\n",
      "Doesn't get much better when it comes to pre-workouts! I've tried quite a few and C4 is always consistently the best! \n",
      "\n",
      "This is by far one of the best pre-workouts I have ever taken.  Its always my go to.  You don't become immune to it like other pre-workouts that I have taken.  This product does not make you jittery.  Although I will say that when I take two full scoops, I do get itchy.  But it is nothing outrageous that would make me stop taking this product.  The Green Apple is amazing.  Highly recommend this product. \n",
      "I used Nano Vapor as my first preworkout when I was about 14. My friend told me to get C4 so I got it and let me just say it is amazing. I've been using it for almost 2 years and it still works. I don't get the insane energy like I use to but it still helps a lot. Basically if I don't have C4, I don't workout. BUY IT FROM BODGBUILDING.COM. My friend bought 2 60 servings from GNC and they were 70 dollars each. I buy them from here for only 47 dollars. If you want to improve your physique and have better workouts, use C4. \n",
      "Great watermelon flavor, but I don't think it actually worked for me well as a preworkout. It definitely didn't give me the pump I needed. \n",
      "Good taste and  good energy. Very experienced with pre workouts and I always come back for more C-4.\n",
      "I have been taking C4 for over a year. I have tried many other pre-workouts but none have come close to the taste or quality of C4. Green apple is by far my favorite flavor, strawberry margarita being second. I tried orange and that wasn't that great. Taste aside, I do experience a boost in energy and performance. Overall, great product\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite pre-workout by far. Tastes good and it gives you that tingly feeling. I use two scoops. Good stuff, good quality ingredients. \n",
      "This is a great pre-workout supplement. I have used this for the past month and each day no matter what mood I am prior to leaving for the gym, once I get there I know I am going get a great boost in energy and a nice pump too.\n",
      "good product! good energy! gives a feeling of fullness and good work!\n",

      "Let me start off by saying it tastes really good. With that said it isnt that great of a preworkout. I dont feel very energized or that great of a pump and it also wears off after about 30 min. This is with 2 rounded scoops keep in mind. I do not take over the s****ested serving size for any other preworkout except this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Best Preworkout out there. Ive tried many different preworkouts over the past 3 years and this is definitely my favorite. Great pumps, no complains, and you dont have to run to the bathroom after taking it like a lot of other preworkouts. Blue Razzberry by far the best flavor. \n",
      "I've been using pre-workout supps since NO-Xplode had the cyan crazy labels and MRI's No2 book was just introduced. Holistically speaking, this product is fantastic. Best taste I've encountered so far (Watermelon). In terms of pump/volume expansion during work out it's really competitive. I'd really s****est trying the 10 serving pack first if you're unsure. Only downside I see, once you make it part of the workout ritual, working out without it, will feel like you're missing your cellphone or something similar. Solid product never the less. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste of this product is heavenly! Absolutely delicious. It gives a decent pump and some energy. I think there may be better products out there that give better energy/pumps but aside from that the taste is great :)\n",
      "My ish. Love the taste and I get a good pump. Wish I had seen that they came out with Strawberry Margarita. Icy Blue Razz is my fav so far but always down to try something new.\n",
      "Good pre workout. Gives me a decent pump and motivates me to keep going.\n",
      "I've been using this product for quite awhile now. I've used countless pre-workouts, and this is my favorite by far. I haven't tried a flavor I don't like yet, pineapple being my favorite. C4 for gives you outstanding focus and energy for an intense workout. You will get the \"Tingly\" feeling that some don't like. I peronally like it. Lets me know it's working. \n",
      "The best of the best for pre workout. Works awesome taste super good, like koolaid! lol I did try others and never like it but this one is great! pump you to lift for sure and give you the energy that really need your body ! . I love it, recomended 100%\n",
      "Works like it should, I was very pleased with the pumps that I got from it, as soon as I ran out I tried \"White Flood Reborn\", it's ok but I like C4 better.\n",
      "Taste is amazing! Taste about like a green apply jolly rancher!  This stuff really works! I can definitely go longer and harder after taking C4! This stuff easily gets me thru a good workout after a long hard day at work. \n",
      "Great pre workout drink. Tastes great.  Does not give you the caffeine overload buzz.  I gave this to my wife who prefers the milder nature of this product\n",

      "\n",
      "Between the three pre-workout supplements I've tried (C-4, Fast Fuel, 4D Pump.) C-4 is the best one on the market. Gives your an almost immediate boost of energy, a little strong in flavor but tastes great and goes down easily and it doesn't slow you down later.\n",
      "Decent pre-work out I need 2 scopes which is why i rated the way i did to receive notable effects, c4 provides a good pump above average and i begin to flush at times but never to the point where i have to stop my work out i personally enjoy it, good product i plan to finish my 30 servings and may buy more later on to use on off days from other supplements\n",
      "It work. I must of ordered 4 of them during my progress. I just recently switch because I want to test something else, most likely I will come back.\n",

      "I've been using C4 since the product  came out and still feel it. I have had to up my dosage but it still gives me explosive workouts. Best pre-workout ever! Orange, Blue Razz and Fruit Punch were my favorites until I got the Green Apple..it's my new favorite! Thanks Cellucor and Bodybuilding.com!\n",
      "After using Cellucor's C4 Extreme I can honestly say that no other pre-workout works for me anymore! Every flavor tastes great & it truly works too. Believe me when I say it's worth the money!\n",
      "Very good product,excellent workout! Feel energized after 15min of taking one dose!!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my new favorite preworkout drink. Plenty of energy and focus in the gym without feeling jittery or restless. Great taste too.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing that compares to C4, this is by far the best tasting preworkout on the market. Gives me a great kick every time I use it.\n",
      "Taste incredible, soon after consuming one scoop, I start to feel the power inside pushing like a giant want to get out from me. Steady flow of energy really powered my workout from begin to the end...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good product although you should probably choose not to take 6 times a week like I did... Can develop tolerance pretty quick. Still works great. Go with strawberry margarita.\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is amazing. I mean it would boost your workout 40% better. You get the energy not just for lifting weights but for intense cardio as well. \n",
      "My first time taking a full scoop resulted in a good workout. I had good focus and endurance while it lasted. My third time taking it, I had to increase it to a scoop and a half and I didn't get anything from it. I only felt the effects of C4 for approximately 30-45 minutes and then it was gone. Any preworkout that I MUST take over the serving size isn't financially smart for me. There are other preworkouts that work much better for me and will be continuing with those. I was let down by the effectiveness of this product since the taste is very good.\n",
      "I love what this product does for me at the gym, but be warned, I live in San Diego which is fairly humid, and twice now i've ordered this product and the powder has started to clump up about 15 days into opening it. It has to be the way they make their lids because multiple other supplements i have do fine with the humidity. \n",
      "Love the flavor and the energy this product gives to help me make it through my long workout\n",
      "yeah this is nice very nice all kinds of pumps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I like\n",
      "\n",
      "NIce green apple taste, kind of like a Jolly Rancher.  I had a 2 serving sample pack, split it up, but I should have taken the full 2 servings....the energy and focus were OK, but I'm sure they would have been a lot better if I would have taken the entire pack\n",
      "You can feel it working, without any doubt. You can feel it (the rush/flushing) under your skin on initial uptake into your system.  I'm 44years old and this product, mixed with Gatorade powder in my 1st of two 500ml water bottle allows me to complete my 60 full minutes of Precor Elliptical on Interval Program with Resistance set to 13 for the 1st 30 minutes, then 12,11,10 rest of 30... w/ incline peaks of 7-to-13. BEFORE using these two together I had horrible Ammonia smell in my sweat because my body was breaking apart proteins for the needed energy.  Not much aggro \"left in the tank\" for my core & weight training afterward. Now that & vascularity!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "OK. I get VERY jittery and itchy on this stuff but most days it's worth fighting through it. Gives THE BEST initial jolt of energy I've ever had in a pre-workout and it lasts a relatively long time. I feel the new assault gives longer endurance but this is certainly more explosive. Top 2 pre for me.\n",
      "Flavor was awesome... but made my hands itch like crazy :(\n",
      "This is an amazing product. I've tried various pre-workouts and this one really gets me going. I chose Strawberry Margarita and it's a horrible flavor IMO. I'll stick to Fruit Punch since I've tried that one before and it tastes great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this stuff.  It makes me feel pumped throughout my workouts, and the itchy tingle helps me focus.  I stack this with BSN XPlode,  \n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure you drink plenty of water with this!\n",
      "This product definitely delivers on taste. I've been using it for a couple weeks and can say that I've had more than enough energy and focus to complete my workouts at a high level. I have not noticed the \"pumped\" feeling I've had with other NO PWS, but I'm mostly interested in the stimulate part of the supplement. I also haven't experienced any crashing afterwards that I've had from other PWS. This is a great product, in my opinion, and will remain as part of my routine for the foreseeable future. \n",

      "\n",
      "This is a solid preworkout supplement, consistent and provides a nice rush of energy. Been using this as a replacement to the old Jack3d with 1,3DMAA and it has been wonderful. Take this on an empty stomach for best results as with all preworkout supplements. The crash is minimal, depends on the amount you take and how hard you worked out, it's definitely nowhere as unbearable as the old jack3d crash. Purchased over 10 of these in the past two years and it's been great. \n",

      "great pre workout!! my bf and i love this\n",
      "C4 was the first product I was recommended when I started lifting to get that extra edge. First off, the taste of their products is the equivalent of drinking the actual drink, fruit punch tastes exactly like fruit punch should. The formula is solid as well, solid doses of arginine, beta-alanine, and a low caffeine dose (135mg), to give a great focus and energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only issues with C4 is for one, the body seems to become more tolerant of the product quickly, therefore losing a bit of effect, and in turn having to take an extra 1/2 scoop. Also it seems to have a thermogenic efffect, which is uncomfortable at times. C4overall has done wonders for my focus, energy, and pumps, and it's downsides are very miniscule. It's a top product for good reason\n",
      "I've been using Assault for a few years as well as Vega Sport.  Decided to try C4 after a friend told me that he loved it and got a great pump from it.  I am SO glad I gave it a go!  I use about 1.5 scoops for my workouts (usually lifting for over an hour) and for my long runs (3+ miles).  I feel it kicking it about 15 minutes after I take it, and sometimes halfway to the gym!  The flavor is also awesome- not heavy or metallic like some of the other pre-workouts I've used in the past.  \n",
      "I got this product free, so I figured I'd try it out. I was skeptical as always with pre-workouts. The first thing I noticed when I opened the tub was it smelled great, unlike most supps. I knew it had to have a great taste and I was right. I could feel energy from the product and had no sides, like jitters. The only downside of C4 is I didn't notice crazy pumps like I have with previous pre-workouts and it made me somewhat woozy on leg day. Overall I'd give C4 a 8.5, due to lack of pump. This is a great pre and I would buy again.\n",
      "Prior to beginning my 'Cor Challenge' training I visited a popular brick & mortar supplement store where I purchased a pre-workout product at the advice of an employee; I was terribly disappointed with the results.  Although I was already a couple of weeks into the COR contest, I decided to order the C-4 from Cellucor and hope that I would receive it in time to give it a try.  Not only was I amazed by the speedy shipping at BB.com (I received the product in only a few days) the product did everything that it promised - abundant energy and strong lifts. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "One of the first supps I tried when I started lifting again were the pre-workouts (seeing as I often get up at 0400 to work out before work!).  I tried quite a few different brands before I stubled upon a free sample of C4.  It just has the right mix of energy boost and NO release and great taste to boot!  Other pre-workouts either gave me jitters, did nothing at all or just plain tasted awful.  Once I started taking C4 I've never switched.  I have tried other flavors but still enjoy the fruit punch best.  \n",
      "This product is the best!\n",
      "Try on and see the results\n",
      "This product worked good for the first few weeks. I started out taking 1 scoop. After a few weeks my body got used to it and I was up to 3 scoops. Hats when I switched to something else. \n",
      "Love how C4 makes me feel before a workout. And for a guy that is out of shape and needs a big push, this is the product that will do it.\n",
      "My fave is icy blue c4 stacked w icy blue m5 all n a 20oz bottle. 30 min b4 workout. I add 1000mg l-arginine pill!!!\n",
      "I just tried the C4 Watermelon today. I absolutely love it, it gave me tons of energy at the gym and improved my workout. The rumors are true, Watermelon tastes just like jolly ranchers! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good pre-workout\n",
      "best tasting pre workout ever and great creatine source u will get an amazing pump use a little bit more then 160z of water or it may be too overwhelming\n",
      "I alway feel the NO flowing through me during the gym. Definitely wont stop taking this product!\n",
      "If you've made it to the review section on this product then you must be looking for answers. And if one of your questions is whether to try this or not, then the simple answer is YES. I've tried and sampled almost all the pre's from the big name companies and I always come crawling back to c4 and asking for forgiveness for trying something else. Recently Cellucor gave me the opportunity to try out their new strawberry margarita flavor and I gotta say, they did a pretty great job. Is it my favorite flavor? No. Is it still amazing? You bet your sweet @$$ it is! If you're looking for a great pre then this is it!\n",
      "I just got back into working out.  This product did help the first week in giving me the boost I needed to get me into the gym.  The affects wore off fast for energy but it did leave me feeling pumped with less than productive workouts.  After a week i had to double the intake to get the same feeling, and it doesn't give the same boost.  I know it is working because my ears burn when I take it.  Good for the boost and need to burn energy but doesn't keep me in the gym.  It currently just gives me the feeling that i had one to many energy drinks.\n",
      "Best pre on the market\n",
      "Probably one of the best tasting pre-workouts, it also gives me great energy and never need more then one scoop and also great pumps. Would definitely recommend this! \n",
      "Tastes great , i use this 15 mins before i Train gets me charged def recommend \n",
      "\n",
      "Gives me a good pump for my workout. have to use a serving and a half but it works. tastes good.\n",
      " It didn'd give me a great pump, however when I take it I'm able to do all my training without getting fainted. I leave the gym with the &quot;mission acomplished&quot; feeling. It's good, but not the best for me.\n",
      "Muito fraco, n?o gostei....\n",
      "Best tasting pre-workout I've ever tried. Started with the watermelon which was ok - decided to give the green apple a shot after reading some other reviews and this is for real. Stuff tastes just like a green jolly rancher. Gives me incredible workouts full of focus and energy.\n",
      "Best pre-workout ever \n",
      "Tastes really good, and gives me a boost to go lift weights.\n",
      "Taste 10/10 Energy 7/10 (lots of jitters) Focus 6/10 Pumps 7/10. Just switched to Jack3d Micro and its so much better\n",
      "Like many other people who have reviewed this product, I do not feel intense pumps or get the spiders, but I do notice that I lift more and have more focus. Having tried a couple different pre-workouts, C4 is by far the best tasting. I Highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for an effective, safe and budget friendly pre-workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "taste good but make sure to drink a lot of water after\n",
      "Awesome! This tastes like an apple Jolly Rancher candy. 1 scoop gives me a good amount of energy and focus to power through a workout, 2 scoops is even better! I pair this with Hemavol for super pumps.\n",
      "I am new to the world of PWOs and I was nervous about trying this product. My first time I used a little under 1 scoop as a test-run and definitely felt more focused and energized. At 6' and just under 200lbs I find that a little over 1 scoop is perfection for me. I feel it hitting with a tingly/itchy feeling in my arms, hands and face and within 10-15 minutes I am ready to go. I generally hit the gym for around 2 hours and find that by the time I am heading out I can feel it starting to fade off. Not major drop off -- I am always able to go into work feeling pumped from my workout and not dragged down after the effects wear off. I definitely recommend this product for newcomers.\n",
      "\n",
      "By far one of the best TASTING pre-workouts I've ever tried. Blue Razz is delicious and a little on the tangy side (almost feels like I'm drinking candy!. Gives me great focus for intense hour workouts... and then some!!!\n",
      "This is by far the best preworkout supplement I have taken. It gives me that burst at the gym when I'm trying to complete a set or get an extra rep out. Highly recommended\n",
      "I was using a simple micronized creatinie monohydrate as my pre-workout, but this changed my view (and my workout) completely. Mixes extremely well in my BodyBuilding 3-in-1 shaker, and I started to feel the effects after about 10 minutes. I felt energized, ready for a workout, and I was able to lift the same weight an extra 5-7 reps in all excercises performed. Break times between exercises were also reduced. I am very happy with this product. \n",
      "This is an amazing product!! first time i put too much and i got gittery but that was my fault. once i started measuring the amount it got way better and i am definitely improving in my physical ability. highly recommend it.\n",
      "My go to when in doubt need a pick me up to go kill it at the gym! The orange flavor is the best tasting pre workout I have ever tasted. Wakes me up, gives me a great pump, and does not up set my stomach. I usually hate the tingly feeling in the face that the Beta Alanine gives but C4 taste so **** good I don't mind.\n",
      "I usually drink one before each workout. Highly recommended!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucor gave me the opportunity to test the C4 Strawberry Margarita and EXCLUSIVE C4 Green Apple\n",
      "Flavoring. It tastes more like strawberry IMO. Solid no real complaints.\n",
      "Green Apple: Exactly like Jolly Rancher\n",
      "Ingredients: C4's Beta Aline, Creatine nitrates, and Caffeine (135mg) Give you all the Focus and PUMP for a hardcore workout without sleepless nights and jitters. \n",
      "Price: with all the bundle deals you can always find C4 for a steal and it is always worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a TOP SELLER for a REASON\n",
      "I have been using C4 for about 2 years now, and the new Strawberry Margarita flavor certainly didn't disappoint! I've tried all flavors except for the Green Apple and this comes in at a close second as my favorite right behind the Icy Blue Raz. As always, the C4 mixes effortlessly and has great taste that is unsurpassed by anyone else in the industry. The only thing I would note is that the flavor of the strawberry marg can be a bit too sweet if mixed with the recommended 4-6oz of water per scoop. I have found that diluting it with just a little more water (8oz per scoop) made the flavor perfect. Since I work out around 3:30a, I usually take 2 scoops, but if I am going to the gym after work i'll typically just stick to one scoop. This product stacks EXCELLENTLY with the NO3 Chrome as well as the P6 Black. I am currently running the C4 with the P6 Black right now and am loving the intense focus, great pump, and extra boost in strength that the combo provides.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just tried both the green apple and the strawberry margarita flavors of c4. Not only are the effects of the product fantastic, the taste is amazing too. I get great energy, pumps, and solid focus with these. The green apple flavor tastes exactly like a green apple jolly rancher, which tastes amazing. The strawberry margarita tastes like a great strawberry drink with a hint of lime (or something else). Both flavors are two of the top flavors in the market by far! Definately my go to pre workout for both the effects and the fantastic flavors offered. Can't go wrong with C4!\n",
      "Good, clean energy, and the flavor's not too bad.  A little sweet, but goes down easier than other products I've tried.  Mixes well, but not as big of a boost as I've gotten with other products either. Built a tolerance pretty fast. Overall, it's a decent  product, but if you're looking for a big energy boost I might look elsewhere.\n",
      "This stuff tastes amazing and you don't get that bloated feeling after taking it, but it just doesn't quite pack the all important punch. Energy, focus and stamina are ok, but I've taken better. Would like to see a little more beta alanine and cit malate in it, then this product would be much better. \n",
      "Just tried the watermelon C4 for my pre workout. I had 2 scoops and had such amazing mental clarity and energy. I busted out an hour on the stairmaster like a maniac! It gave me energy and also a tingly feeling, haha... I'm not sure if that's good or not but I felt great. I took 2 scoops, so perhaps on one scoop the tingling is not as noticeable. I will be buying this again and trying other flavors! \n",
      "Love Love Love this product. I've been using for about 6 months (with a few weeks break here and there) but it definitely gives me an edge and mind frame of attack when I hit the gym (be it weights or cardio). I work out early also, 5am, so I need a swift kick in the arse and something to keep me focused for the hour or 1.5 hours I spend there. Drives me, keeps me focused and always making strength gains when on it.\n",
      "Really great tasting preworkout. Cellucor is always pushing great products and this is up to par with the other c4 flavors. Really enjoyed the taste. I recommend this to all my friends and gym goers looking for an effective preworkout that has a great taste. Cannot recommend this enough. This flavor is like the sour apple candies I used to eat.\n",
      "Good product. Didn't crash after use. Didn't feel any concerning change. Just energy.\n",
      "Always been one of my goto pre-workout supps. I love the tingling feeling that i get shortly after taking it and it seems like it gives me insane pumps. The taste isn't as good as i would like but its not as sugary as some i have tried. I will always recomend this product to others.\n",
      "This is a great prework out, gives you the focus and extra energy you need to get those extra reps out. Great Product I would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "Gave me a nice pump. \n",
      "Great pump and taste! This is my preworkout staple. Not sure how I got by before without it! Although sometimes I could use a little more kick or tingle, but overall great stuff and good price!\n",
      "\n",
      "This pre-workout is the best one I've ever taken to date. The pump is unmatched to any other product. The energy is great, not as much as some of the other high energy pre-workouts but still awesome. The focus is amazing, you are glued to the weight room and just can keep going all day. The taste....It is just delicious. I could drink it all day long. It taste like liquid jolly ranchers. Overall one of the best pre-workouts on the market still.\n",
      "Incredible strength gains and tastes so good! It doesn't help me focus like Superpump Max did but a close second. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing special for me. I'm taking only 1,5 scoop. This was a free product after buying 2 B-BCAA from Cellucor, so it's ok. Before that I was taking White Flood and I felt more resistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great product! it tastes good and wakes me up for the gym every morning! I have noticed my body is getting used to this pre-workout and i have to add an extra scoop after 3 months of taking it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a great energy boost to help increase their performance. \n",
      "This pre hands down is the best tasting out there. Pink Lemonade actually tastes better than brisk pink Lemonade, and it's a Pre Workout! As far as performance goes, I am alert and energized enough to get a solid 2 hr workout in. Watermelon is right up there as far as taste too.\n",
      "I use this before every workout and I have found that this product gives better results than Jack3d or MP Assault. The Orange flavor is definitely my favorite but a lot of my coworkers love the Strawberry Margarita flavor. I get better motivation and focus while using this product and I get bigger reps by staying focused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No energy increase, and no increased pump at all. Worst pre workout supplement I have ever used. Taste is ok.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted a less calorie-intense preworkout. Got this stuff with the Cellucor protein bundle. Let me say, this is an amazing pre-workout. Not only is the Strawberry Margarita one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted, this stuff works. I feel like a beast in the gym. It gives me a complete focused feeling and allows me to just keep pushing throughout the entire workout. I'm hooked.\n",
      "This is my favorite pre-workout EVER!!! It works within like 20 mins as it says i work out for like 2 hours but it only feels like 1 because of how much energy and the pump i get.. The taste in my opinion is really good it taste exactly like what they say.. Blue Razzz taste great, Green apple taste like green apples, and those are the only ones i tried but im sure fruit punch and the others taste just like the name... Great JOB!!!\n",
      "It taste good and works withing minutes. It helps me make it through and mixes easy.\n",
      "I started off taking just one scoop but after about 2 weeks it was not getting me jacked like in the beginning I went to 1 1/2 scoops and its back to the good pumped feeling as long as I dont need more than 2 scoops I would consider this a great product. It gives you the focus and want to needed to get up every morning and work out for 1.5 hrs.\n",
      "Great product. Gave good consistent energy. I was surprised by how good this tasted a lot of the pre-workouts I've had tasted nasty but this is probably the best I've had taste wise.\n",
      "I usually hate the taste of pre-workouts, the tingle it puts in my mouth as I try to gag it down. C4 changed my mind on that however. This is by far the best tasting pre-workout I've had, EVER. It gives me great intensity during my workout, and keeps me focused throughout to get an awesome pump, and a great lift in. Would by far recommend to anyone.\n",
      "Great taste!! Mixes well. I use 1 and 3/4 scoops for each serving. I had good energy and focus. Would use again as a PWO.\n",
      "Awesome stuff\n",
      "This product is amazing. The taiste is great and it is very good for energy. I like that I don't have to drink a large glass of water before the workout like other pre-workouts so I am not bloated at all. Best pre-workout I've ever had..and thats a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's nice when you use 2 dose :D\n",
      "C4 makes your struggles a thing of the past what ever your goal is from running to lifting weight's at the gym, C4 gives me that boost, stamina and indurance it actually holds you by the hand haven't experiance nothing like it the best of all no inregular heart beat's try it you'll see what I'm talking about.\n",
      "Flavor was great and it mixed well enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate the way Beta Alanine makes my everything itch like crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even at double doses, this product did not give me much energy. I heard great things about this product and it's unfortunate that it didn't do it for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps others will have better luck.\n",
      "I am not one to like the tastes of alot of things. I am very picky and ahve been with the same pre workout for two years. Then finally I tried C4 it is amazing it tastes great and gives me a great pump. I was very skeptical but this proved me wrong! I really recommend this\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By far best pre-workout I have ever used.  Will be purchasing again.  \n",
      "This is the best PWO i have tried yet. Energy, focus, pump is all there. Not so much caffeine you are all jittery. Just perfect amount. I use 1.5 scoops and i'm a big guy. HIGHLY recommend!!\n",
      "I have taken a number of pre-workouts, and not many have the quality as well as affordability. I choose C4 of many other pre-workouts for it's superior formula. It has Creatine Nitrate, which i believe absorbs quicker. Bitter Orange, or synephrine, which helps B vitamins do their job. Also a good amount of Caffeine. No joke this will get you warm and ready before you workout. I tried Green Apple, and compared to all their other flavors, except for Orange and Margarita- which i haven't tried, I believe it is the best flavor so far. I openly recommend this Pre to all my friends.\n",
      "Hmmm....not too bad. Only problem is it took two scoops of C4 to do what one scoop of other brands can do. Wouldn't buy it again. It just took to much product to get a good affect for me.\n",
      "Tried it for the first time today and loved it - gave me a ton of energy and I felt like I could keep going forever! I was REALLY motivated to do my run (and then some!) - which doesn't happen very often. I am also sampling no explode and cardio igniter so I will be comparing as I work through each 10 serving sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very strong product! I took NO xplode and didnt like it, this pre-workout is very good and i only recommend you use it if you feel like **** and want to go to the gym. \n",
      "Awesome taste and effect.\n",
      "i can actually sleep if i use this pre workout, everything else has way to much caffeine\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor is good, a little to sweet for my taste. I just add about 2 or 3 more ounces of water to make it less sweet. This product really helps you focus, especially on those hard days when you don't feel like working out.\n",
      "I first tried this product in a 2 serving sample pack that came in with my order. This stuff impressed me right from the start. The pump was amazing! My energy sustained at a high level throughout the entire workout without crashing. I then went on to try a few other popular brands and this one stood out on top. I just ordered the bundle stack on sale from Cellucor for 69.99. (3 2lb Tubs Protien/30 serv. C-4)Great deal!\n",
      "I think I like this product more than craze but craze s good too! I get good workouts with this product. \n",
      "I had to try something out new since the new Jack3d was terrible. This stuff works awesome, not as powerful as the old Jack3d but it still works better then most of the PWO stuff. Gives me good pumps and helps with the concentration. \n",
      "First off, the orange flavor is awesome! It seems like I break pr's everytime I use this as a preworkout. I use this on every leg day and it gives me extreme energy, focus, and strength. I definitely will buy this again and highly recommend it!\n",
      "I love this stuff !!!!!\n",
      "It has changed my workouts from clock in clock out to breakout and surpass all your own limits. I can't wait to go to the gym and see how much further I can push myself, new limits new records and new mindset since I started using this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you Cellucor\n",
      "\n",
      "This has to be one the best pre workouts I have tried in sometime.. I bought it yesterday from GNC and got a great deal on for 28 bucks !! Needless to say I have been impressed with it so far tastes great and it has a great pump I was getting extra reps I normally Couldn't I would definitely recommend this product !!!!!\n",
      "Best preworkout supplement I've ever used. It tastes like watermelon Jolly Ranchers\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a few tubs of the watermelon flavor and was not disappointed, it tastes great like jolly ranchers.  I was looking for something better than coffee and energy drinks to wake me up to workout after work and this definitely works, i get an immediate clarity in my eyes and mind about 15-22 minutes after drinking not to mention the tingle it gives.  I feel more determined to exercise and there is no stop to the energy flow it seems like.  I use it before lifting/exercising and before my Brazilian jiu jitsu class and i was running faster during warmups and didn't tire out during any of the drills i normally would, and i barely had 4 hours of sleep usually id be yawning all class but not with this stuff!\n",
      "By far, thee best pre-workout product I have taking! I have taken NO-Explode, jack3d and a whole bunch of different types. I do initially get that tingly feeling throughout my body and in my ears, but I love that feeling. It is quickly gone and when I am in the gym, I just feel unstoppable, like I can lift anything. I have started recommended this to my friends and I strongly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great pre-workout booster.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has to be my favorite pre-workout.  Unlike many other pre-workouts, this one never loses its effectiveness.  The Watermelon flavor seriously tastes like a watermelon jolly rancher, which is a plus. :P  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to increase their focus and endurance in the gym.      \n",
      "it makes me feel great in the gym son!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great pre-workout. Gets the blood flowing and gets the skin tingling.\n",
      "I tried both the Icy Blue Razz and Pink Lemonade. The taste is by far the best of any pre-workout I've had thus far. I would recommend that to anyone who taste is one of the main priorities. Next, the consistency mixes fast and doesn't leave a mess. I even mixed it with some BCAA and the Cor-Series Creatine. This product has been pretty important to me in prep since energy levels are my main concern. I can feel C4 kick in a few minutes after consumption which I really like at 5:00 AM!  If I don't have a good workout or the energy to push forward, this prep would be unimaginable. \n",
      "\n",
      "The best pre-workout i've taken yet. Thats not saying alot though, (i've only taken ON PRE, HIT, Oxy-elite). Well it makes you feel good, doesnt make me itch like ON PRE did. Not sure it enhanced my abilities to lift, but I haven't tried two servings yet. Will re-review if two scoops makes a difference.\n",
      "This is a great pre-workout supplement. I used the Watermelon flavor, and I must say, it was the greatest tasting pre-workout I have ever used. I can also say that the effects were very noticeable. Towards the end of the bottle, I needed 1.5 scoops rather than the single serving dose of 1 scoop, but that was only for the last two-three weeks. Overall, the focus was great, although I don't remember it lasting longer than 45 minutes or so which worked for me, being in the gym for an hour. You can definitely feel the Beta-Alanine, more-so than some other pre-workouts I have taken. The pump was also very nice, and no stomach sickness like N.O. X-Plode 2.0 has given me. So; if you are looking for a GREAT tasting pre-workout, with above-average results, give C4 a try, you won't likely be disappointed.\n",
      "Great stuff! Works good and taste great!\n",
      "This is by far the best out there right now. I ordered Pink Lemonade and Orange, both taste great. Have been using it for about 4 months now and so far have seen great results at the gym.\n",
      "A few years back i started using NO-xplode as my preworkout, but i wasnt getting the desired results. I then switched to Jack3d, but sadly moved away from that after it was reformulated. I tried C4 based on a recommendation from a friend. It worked great for me i got the energy surge and pump i expect out of a preworkout; it didnt make me antsy. The efffect didnt fade quickly either. I am very pleased with this. \n",
      "I've used NANO Vapor and NO Xplode, but C4 Extreme has been my favorite pre-workout supplement. Gives me serious beta alanine tingles, which I actually like.\n",
      "Tried the Icy Blue Razz and the Fruit Punch flavors. Taste is pretty good considering its a pre-workout/creatine supplement. Performance wise, definitely saw an increase in energy and desire to push myself harder. However, I was not that impressed with my results. Gives a good pump, but my strength/size didnt go up at all. Overall I give the product a 7 out of 10. Not a bad choice, would definitely recommend buying it just to try it and see if your results vary.\n",
      "I LOVE THIS PRE-WORKOUT!!!!  AWESOME ENERGY & PUMP!!  DELICIOUS TASTE\n",
      "\n",
      "tasted great with one serving before hitting the gym  I had the eneregy I needed!\n",
      "great product!\n",
      "\n",
      "C4 absolutely did nothing for me in the gym. no pump, no energy, & just made my face feel itchy. glad i didn't spend full price on a tub and used a sample first.\n",
      "tried quite a few, c4 is still the best, taste the summit, drink like lemonade ....\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "C4 by Cellucor is a great Pre-Workout product. I can feel a good pump every time I go to the gym and always seem to finish strong. I never have experienced a crash or any jitters while taking this product and my body has not adapted to it either! So far this is my favorite I have tried. It has a good taste and mixes very well with water.\n",
      "Pretty good product. The only thing that sucks about this is personally, I have to take 1.5 - 2 servings to feel it. So a 30 serving container for me is good for 15 workouts. But still pretty good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I'd give this - 8/10\n",
      " I'll be ordering a few more soon, my neuroscience is almost out (it was okay) and the Jack3d didnt do anything for me except for some reason I could run for like 5 or 6 miles when i took it. Lifting sucked with the Jack3d though.\n",
      "This is my favorite pre-workout supplement. The Blue Razz tastes like sweet tart powder and is easy to drink quickly before my workout. I feel the Beta Alanine kicking in about 20 minutes after I've consumed it with about 8-10 oz of water. Good vaso-dialation and good muscle pump when I'm done. I've tried the strawberry and lemon flavors too but the Blue Razz tastes best to me. I've been using it for about 6 months and previously used NANO vapor and NO Explode. Everybody is different but this works for me!\n",
      " It is THE main staple in my supplement rotation and a great value, a MUST have for any serious lifter.\n",
      "I started using this two weeks before and I did not really feel the energy increasing. Also the strength endurance which I did not feel. \n",
      "\n",
      "a lot of people go crazy about this stuff. i would rather drink a energy drink from a gas station.\n",
      "I have taken almost all of the flavors of c4 as I have been really pleased with the effects I get a great energy boost a I love the pump it gives me my all around favorite work have to be the new strawberry margarita it has a great taste with no horrible after taste like other preworkouts out there\n",

      "\n",
      "I just tried the sample BodyBuilding.com just sent me and it made a huge difference in my workout.  I took it 30 minutes before hitting the gym, stretched, jumped on the treadmill, and felt like I could run forever.  I ran faster and longer than usual.  Then I hit the weights and ended up maxing out on the cable machine.  All in all, I think it works really well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The low score on the taste is just me, I hate fruity flavors and I'm not a big candy person.  It smells like cotton candy and I had to drink it down fast, because I just generally hate that crap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After trying a variety of NO products (Shotgun, Assault, Xpand, Fast Twitch) and settling with MP Assault for the better part of a year I wanted to try something different. I heard C4 mentioned at the gym a couple times then a trainer buddy started singing its praises so I thought I would give it a shot. After a month I can say I am sold. It taste like Orange Tang and blends better than anything I have used before, it provides just enough \"pump\" to help get that last rep without sacrificing the focus unlike Xpand, did not give me the runs (Fast Twitch) and had better overall results than Muscle Pharm.\n",

      "This is one of the best ones I had. Gave me focus and energy. I workout in the morning and it helped me a lot. TOO BAD I can't order it through the Canadian Site -_-\n",
      "\n",
      "What a waste of $$$$. Does nothing for me, but makes my skin itch. I think that all of these people on here leaving good ratings for this product must work for the company. \n",
      "its a good pre workout supplement . good energy and focus. but i cant take caffeine anymore so i return it and they trying to rip me off by not giving my full amount. this just bull. wouldn't recommend this site.   \n",
      "the taste is amazing! it has a jolly rancher flavor to it. and the rush you get out of it is amazing! best pre workout ever!!!\n",
      " if you want to take this daily i would sub it out, my body got used to it quickly\n",
      "i used this for my light weight day.. it gives me energy throughout my workout! and taste amazing\n",
      "Good Product! Like I said before about the watermelon flavor, Except the Pink lemonade is... Different. Maybe it's because of taking the watermelon before, but the Pink lemonade flavored C4 didn't give me the results the watermelon one did. I loved the watermelon favored C4, The Pink lemonade flavored C4 doesn't really live up to Watermelon. Overall, It's still a good product, and I will keep using it, but next time... Watermelon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, now this is the product your looking for if you like that extra energy pump in your workout. Two scoops and your ready to go... Had energy all the way through my hour workout and still had energy after my workout as well. Great product and I would recommend this to anyone but you might want to start out with one scoop because it is EXTREME...\n",
      "First Pre-workout I have ever tried and I loved it. I took it for about two months however towards the end my body didnt like it too much. The taste got annoying and whenever I took it i felt like I just ate a bunch of junk and then went to the gym but this has happend with all the preworkouts i have taken. Other than that this has been a great product that I recommend to avid preworkout users and begginers just know that if you take this you will work!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been taking this for a little over a week and can definitely feel a difference. Compared to no-xplode and assault, this stuff taste the best and doesn't give me the jittery feeling assault does. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good pre-workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "I Have been taking C4 for a few months now and absolutely love this product. It gives me tons of energy and a lot of motivation while im in the gym. I often find myself forcing myself to quite. Overall, this product is awesome!\n",
      "Loved this product!! My schedule works out to where i have to go to the gym after work, and a lot of days I am drained from work. C4 for is perfect for right before my work out. Lots of energy! great pump! and tons of focus to hit PRs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "simply mad product, the energy sea, I jumped in a hall as abnormal. product on the fan\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Tasting, best Pump\n",
      "Feel like a machine in the gym, i love it. Both blue razz and watermelon are delicious too. Mixes well too\n",
      "Had a great taste gave me a great rush of energy and focus at the gym liked it alot and would recommend it \n",
      "\n",
      "Gives me a great pump during my workouts. Usually take only 1 scoop because any more than that, I get way too jittery. Really gives me great energy when I'm feeling draggy from my cutting diet/low carb days. Flavor is good, but I personally liked the fruit punch better. It also has a kind of weird salty after taste in my opinion.\n",
      "Caffeine pills have always been my preworkout supp of choice. The C4 changed that. This stuff is awesome.\n",
      "Good pump.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great tasting, highly effective pre-workout supplement. I typically workout after a 10-12 hour workday and C4 gives me that extra focus and energy I need to crush a workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have taken this twice and it did not give me the explosive energy it claims it would do.  I took one serving the first time and two servings the second time.  What I did receive from this product was a very itchy feeling on my face and legs like cats are clawing my skin.  Not a great feeling.  Watermellon tastes great, like Jolly Ranchers if you still want to try this.  \n",
      "Hands down the best pre-workout supplement. Taste is really good. Great focus and amazing pump. Does not mess up my stomach like others. Overall, C4 is great. \n",
      "I love this stuff. Makes my workout so much better and I can focus. The very first time I took it I hated it but after I gave it a chance I was amazed how good I felt while working out. Cycling off sucks though but you gotta :)\n",
      "I love C4! The taste on the Fruit Punch and Blue Razz are both amazing. I could drink them all the time. The pump I get in the gym is great. I do sometimes get the tingling sensation however I enjoy it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried both Icy Blue Razz and Orange. Prefer Razz, but both tasted great. I use this in conjunction with the COR-BCAA powder as my pre-workout, and it simply works. That's all that I need to say.\n",
      "Clean workout, good energy, and mixes great. No issues with taste, I could drink it as an energy drink if I needed. \n",
      "I was really looking forward to using this product but it let me down.  Right before using this I was using NO Explode 2.0.  What this product lacks is improving a persons focus.  Initially I took one scoop and was surprised that I did not feel a kick.  The next day I used two scoops but my workout still lacked the intensity.  I hope this review helps you guys.\n",
      "I don't feel a huge stimulation with this product, but it really helps. Have been using only one serving per chest and leg day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Icy Blue Razz is by far the best flavor for me.\n",
      "Took it 4 times so far an it gives me great pumps I have the ability to get more reps done at the gym and it just makes me go crazy ! \n",
      "Great pre-workout. I advanced to it after using No Explode for 2 mths. Very satisfied with the energy levels and the lack of crashing afterwards.\n",
      "love this stuff...great pump, focus, and energy throughout the entire workout plus it actually tastes good. doesn't matter if i'm in for a quick 30min high intensity workout or a 2 hour workout. I've tried, assult, jack3d and micro, craze, no xplode 2.0, and black powder.  This is by far the best pre-workout i've taken.  no xplode and mp assult are a waste of money and they taste like crap.\n",
      "I was taking Assault before this and although it helped I have noticed the longevity and reps im able to push out more have increased dramatically while taking C4 and it taste so good! I have taken quite a few pre workouts and this one ranks up there. I am taking it with no3 and it pushes it even higher to the next level. With both Ive noticed max reps and strength increases. As well as visually bigger and lean. I love these two products together and even separate. \n",
      "tastes soo good and works very well but i cant feel a tingle on my lips i did the first time i tried it but never again after that.\n",
      "C4 is a great product! I get decent pumps from it and the energy is great! It doesn't have alot of tingles which doesn't bother me. I get alot of energy from this product. I definitely recommend!\n",
      "After using many pre workouts I finally found C4! This stuff is amazing, you can actually feel it working within 20 minutes of taking it. The best thing is that I have not felt any sort of crash afterwards either so I have recommended this to anyone that needs that boost to get in those extra sets!\n",
      "This stuff is pretty strong for beginners. I loved it but after a month my tolerance increased. It's a great boost though \n",
      "C4 is one my favorite pre workouts, I have used a few different types of pre workout and with c4 I saw the most change! When I started the product I saw a drastic change in my energy in the weight room, and in my drive to keep going and get those extra few lifts in! \n",
      "I get a good pre-workout boost with C4. Most days I feel unmotivated and \"too tired\" to work out. This product totally cures it. Also, I swear that watermelon flavor tastes like a jolly rancher. \n",
      "\n",
      "Would be a 10/10 but I had to take 2 scoops for any sort of effects. Which isn't a bad thing because I usually have to superdose other products to get the same desired effect. Taste is fantastic and cost is right on par with other products. It's number 2 on the top 50 for a reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This IS the est preworkout I have taken to date. I HIGHLY reccomend it. Its got a great flavour and does exactly what its supposed to do in the perfect quantity. Great pump, perfect energy, and spot on focus. I know alot of reviews just say this but it is the best. Ive let friends try it and now they have me ordering them some. YOu simple cant beat a great flavour and the amazing results. WOOOOOO\n",
      " C4 is now one of my top pre workout supplements.\n",
      "This product works really well switching from N.O took a week for my stomach to get used to though...watermelon wasn't all that great but i love icy blue razz!\n",
      "Best tasting supplement i have taken overall! I took C4 for two months and i gained focus, energy, and was able to complete more sets and reps. I like how i could feel my arms tingling (made me aware i was ready to go) Only problem is i built a tolerance to it over that two months. But overall I am very pleased with it. Will take again after a tolerance break!\n",
      "\n",
      "This PWO is wonderful. I don't get itchy or tingly which is good, I just get great long lasting energy that helps me power through my workouts. The watermelon is DELICIOUS!!!\n",
      "I tried this after seeing it go on sale and was pleasantly surprised with the results. Icy Blue Razz was my favorite flavor, followed closely by Fruit Punch. I wasn't so hot on the Pink Lemonade. Compared to most pre-workouts this stuff is quite drinkable and you barely get the creatine taste at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like to do about 1.5-2 scoops a few minutes before my workout and feel the beta-alanine kick in almost immediately. Having a somewhat low caffeine content is good for those with low tolerances as well. Great pumps from the NO and beta-alanine, a solid product for a great price. When on sale here at bb.com this stuff can be had for just under $.50/serving!\n",
      "Just ordered this product because all my friends say its amazing. I'm definitely looking forward to trying it out. Supposedly Blue Razz is the best tasting too, I'm pumped!\n",
      "fruit punch is the best tasting pre wo ive ever tried.  im not a huge fan of the beta al tingly face and itchy ears, enough caffeine for me at 280 lbs i only need two scoops. this is the only pre wo ive consistently purchased without changing to other brands\n",
      "The taste is amazing I've had orange before and loved it but Icy blue Razz is amazing! It's like I'm cheating drinking juice instead it's so tasty. The pumps I get while also taking NO3 is awesome.\n",
      "This is a great product i used to take amino energy by ON but once i tried this i gotta say my strength gains went up and energy is lovelyy!\n",
      "This pre-workout is awesome! I've tried a few, NO Xplode, Hyper FX, Hemorage, Jack3d, Assault and others and C4 kicks all of their butts! As far as taste and effectiveness of the product, C4 does it for me. No jittery effects, no racing heartbeats and no flat feeling, just a great workout. Even after working for 50 days, 11 hours a day, I can take C4 and get a great workout in, multiple sessions a week. Watermelon is my favorite flavor as well, not too strong just goes down real easy. Fruit punch is ok, a little strong though. Thanks Cellucor!\n",
      "Blue Razz flavor tastes amazing!  Great pre-workout supp.  Good pump.  Good focus. \n",

      "ive tried other pre workouts and this is my favorite. I like the flavor and the effecs. I felt like a beast and felt like I was giving a little bit more than I normally could while lifting heavy. I felt a great pump and a great sensation on my skin. dont use it for any sort of cardio. and try not to take it with in 6 hrs of your sleep time cause it'll keep you up\n",
      "Didn't really feel anything at all few tingles on arms that it \n",
      "a good pre-workout! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This has to be the best pre-workout supp i have ever taken. I've tried a couple in the past and not only do they not give me the same energy or pump, but the jittery feeling is gone. All you get is the intense feeling to go, to lift more and more. Its almost like it distracts your brain from everything else, and you can finally do what you go to the gym for, to lift and feel it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried several different pre-workout drinks and this is the best one for me. Keeps me focused and gives me that extra energy I need to push through my workouts. I have tried watermelon (tastes like a Jolly Rancher) and pink lemonade (not bad at all). I highly recommend this stuff....\n",
      "This is by far my favorite pre-workout drink mix. It gets me jacked up enough to run through a bring wall!\n",
      "I was taking Amino Energy before I worked out, but that has since changed. I switched to C4 earlier and haven't really looked back since. I mean it makes my face tingle about 5 minutes in so I figured hell, its gotta be doing something right. It does tend to make you dehydrated, and I know that most supplements do since they contain caffeine, but my thirst is unparalleled during workouts. Its like I've been trapped in a desert for 5 months living on sips of water and suddenly stumble across a lake of freshwater every time I hit the water fountain. Overall though I rate the product great, Blue razz/Watermelon taste great, I strongly suggest these two, however caution to the person that spills or get the powder wet. This stuff stains like no other. Overall a great product.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried a lot of free samples of pre workouts and personally take C4. C4 is by far the best pre workout I have taken. Gives you great pump which is one of my favorite things about it. I get fruit punch, I haven't tried any other flavors but it taste great to me. C4 gives great energy and has no crash. \n",
      "Don't try it. IT cause a problem on my stamoch. I dont think this product works\n",
      "Great flavor, mixes well and provides plenty of energy for workouts.  Watermelon and blue raspberry also taste very good.  Only drawback is it has a tendency to clump after a little while on the shelf.\n",
      "I usually hate pre workouts, especially the taste. This one has changed my perception completely. It tastes great (I got the watermelon), gave me crazy focus during my workout, and have been taking it ever since. I've actually had to buy bigger shirts. By far the best pre-w I have had to date.\n",
      "i have just finished my 2nd bottle of c4 and i think its great! definitely gives me a boost i don't get a head ache before, during, or after my workout. overall i give it a 9/10 and will definitely be buying more!!  \n",
      "The best pre workout I have tried, and the only one that doesn't make me feel half sick to my stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      " My rankings for pre workouts :1) Muscle Assualt 2) White Flood (under rated) 3) Jack 3d ( old formula) 4) c-4(over rated) !!\n",
      "It gave me alot more energy the first week but my body quickly got used to it. I stopped taking it and have noticed very little difference it my workouts\n",
      "Headaches...\n",
      "No effect even with two scoops upon starting the product.\n",
      "Watermelon taste was sour like if you were drinking warhead candy juice (if it even exists). Unpleasant to drink.\n",
      "This is my second Pre-workout and i love this one over Muscle Pharm Assault! Even though im just 15 i workout everyday and this supplement is the best i've tried! Icy Blue Razz is the best flavor. It is strong yet it is not one you'll get tired of.\n",
      "C4 Extreme was my first pre-workout that worked like I wanted to!\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time I was going to try a pre-workout supplement, I ended up buying EVERY pre-workout in the top 50 most bought supplements here on bodybuilding.com. Crazy, right?!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, it was a long testing process but in the end I chose C4. It was the only one out of three others that didn't make me nauseous a couple hours after my workout and the only one that gave me energy and motivation to keep going during my workout. The only thing I don't like is how the creatine always makes me bloat  a bit :/ totally worth though and fully recommend C4 and most of it's flavors! Still haven't tried pineapple though!!\n",
      " UPDATE: I'm about 10 workouts in with this and the effect is true every time. I found that if you use ICE COLD water, it actually tastes great - like a less sugary blue jolly rancher.\n",
      "I feel it about 30 minutes after taking it.  I luckily found the right mixture immediately so it was beneficial and enjoyable from the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do highly recommend C4 Extreme, the Icy Blue Razz flavor is the best I've tried. Fruit Punch is also good...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good pre-workout blend.\n",
      "This is my absolute favorite pre-workout! I've tried NOxplode, Assault, Superpump MAX, Superpump 250 etc but none work as well as this.\n",
      "No crashing, extreme focus, I am a dominator at the gym with some great pump and I dont feel funny/insane in the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "this is a very effective pre-workout it does everything it says it will do. im not new to pre-workouts by any means ive tried every big name brand you can think of and this is by far one of the better ones. the taste is great, the pump is great, the focus is what i really like and the energy blast is nice as well. if its your 1st pre-workout than this is a great choice if your not new to pre-workout supps like me than this is also a great choice.\n",
      "Great taste, good energy boost, however i got a bit itchy from it. Once i had pushed past that, it seemed to give me the go i need to increase my workout\n",
      "Amazing I liked it A lot(:\n",
      "This is a highly rated pre-workout here on bb.com so i tried a 5 serving size and glad i did not waste more money on this, it did nothing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best pre-workout EVER. I first got hooked off 1 sample thrown in my BB.com order. I've taken all the &quot;great&quot; and popular pre-workout supplements and this was the best by far. Great pumps, increased mental focus, and you really don't crash from it. If your face starts tingling you know its workin! Only negative side... my doctor said my liver tests were off after about 2 months of taking it. But, its by far the best on the market! DO IT.\n",
      "I feel like I can murder a ogre with one punch after taking this stuff. I have to take 2 servings though which can be a little expensive. Taste like kool aid! Best pre-workout I've ever taken\n",
      " I bought a 60 serving of C4 and right now I am using a scoop and a half every other day before workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Got  this as a free sample.  Love the energy that it gave me and the taste is great.  Will be buying my own now thank you.\n",
      "Used it for about 2 months straight. It will give you awesome enerygy boost but there is a MAJOR SIDE-EFFECT. ONCE YOU STOP TAKING IT YOU WILL HAVE ED (Erictile Dysfunction) syndroms for about 1 month. This thing had me scared. I would love to get back on it but the not risking ED, NEVER TAKING HARSH CHEMICALS LIKE THIS AGAIN.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is very good, and you get a great amount of energy and desire to lift heavier and more reps. Such a great product.\n",
      "This is my favorite pre-workout...\n",
      "\n",
      "I had always been a loyal fan of Jack3d until I tried C4. This Preworkout Supplement works and tastes good. I had recently platued and started taking this and blew right through. I highly recommend this. \n",
      "Just as a reference: i have tried jack3d, superpump250, nano vapor, assault, NO Explode. I had 2 sample packs of this (2 servings each) and wanted to try it for a change. I was not blown away by this product. It gave me that itchy feeling like jack3d and a decent energy boost, however it failed during the workout for me. My muscles were fatigued and i was ready to leave as soon as my sets were done. Im going with assault again, not the best boost but great intra workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've used this product for about a week now and it seems to live up to some of the hype. You can tell it's beginning to work around 10-15 minutes after taking it, because your skin begins to tingle from the Beta-Alanine. Other than that I didn't really notice a crazy pump or a huge energy surge. I bought this product mainly just to try something new and it just happened to be on sale at the time. I'm going to stick with my usual pre-workout mix in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "About half way though my 30 servings bottle and am pretty disappointed. Have tried 2 scoops on an empty stomach and i feel like the product has zero effect. Was hoping to get a good pump from c4 but i don't.\n",
      "To be honest, C4 had no effect on me whatsoever. I'm sure it works for people but didn't with me.\n",
      " Taste is also amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I never rate a 10/10. Need to leave room for improvement. Great taste and mixablility was very good. I love this pre-workout. Great energy, and mental focus, and the NO3 pump really gets you jacked. I have tried many pre-workouts and this one is top of my list. After one 30 serving can I'm getting used to it so I'll rotate it. I did stack it with Con-Cret last workout and I was super pumped and huge! This is worth the money in my opinion.\n",
      "Not as satisfied as I wished for a pre workout. Its main ingredient is creatine nitrate, not a nitric oxide. The taste was great, and I did feel somewhat focused, but don't expect it to give you a huge energy boost.\n",
      "I First tried the free sample pack which gave me such a pump and helped me drive myself to the absolute limits my body could handle (2 servings). I was hooked so I ordered some more, I've been using it now for the past week using 2 servings and now even 3. I no longer get that enraged pump that I initially got. Idk if my body is used to it or what but I'm not sure pushing past 3 servings is a healthy choice, I am 6'9 270-280lbs. Definently going to find another pre-workout once I'm through with this one\n",
      "\n",
      "I bough this supplement, cause i see the rates, but is a lie! Pump 2/10, Strong 2/10, focus 3/10. It's a crap!!! only marketing!\n",
      "This product is a real disappointment!  I love the flavour, but as a pre-workout stimulant, it falls flat.  I took 2 scoops prior to my workout, and I felt no change what so ever.  No elevated heart rate, no increased body temp, no tingles, no focus.  I had to go and take a scoop of bodybuilding.com's N.O. fruit punch, to get some results. \n",
      "\n",
      "Skip this and use something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried one scoop of this and it did not do as promised, then took 2 scoops the next day, nothing! I could barely tell I took anything at all, I'll be using my old pre-workout powder, and now I'm stuck with 3 of these... \n",
      "keeps my pumps and lets me workout without getting tired. very good product\n",
      "This product was a total waste of time!! I felt like I was working out with no type of boost or pump, even when I double the scoops! It was like drinking something that tasted like crap for absolutely no reason! Just ordered The new Jack 3d and can't wait to dump the C4 in the trash where it belongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best pre-workout I have ever tested. NO xplode is crap comparing to C4 Extreme. I'm very sensitive to stimulants and this supplement don't make me feel upset. Another good point is that I used to go to the gym at night and this supplement let me sleep well. The taste is not the best, but not bad at all.\n",
      "Hey, try this **** out!!! Bodybuilding gave a couple of samples and WOW!!! I was lifting like crazy and to top it off 40 minutes off aerobics training. Needless to say I slept like a whipped baby that night. I ordered the 60 servings and I can't wait for it to arrive. All you need is enough motivation to serve yourself a scoop and the C4 will have you ready to burn some energy. I hope this helps.\n",
      "OKAY ALL I I HAVE TO SAY IS THIS ALWAYS GIVES ME A GREAT BOOST OF ENERGY WHEN I HIT THE GYM I WOULD DEFIANTLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE IF THEY WANT A BOOST OF ENERGY WHEN HITTING THE WEIGHTS IN THE GYM  A   \n",
      "Flavor is whatever. But as far as getting a focus or drive from the supplement it fails to deliver. Now if you are not caffeine tolerant this product may be for you. But for those who have used Jack3d in the past and other extremely caffeinated supplements to get their head in gear do not purchase this. I took up to 4 scoops and did not get a buzz from it. It's very mellow at best and it's more of an expensive koolaid then anything else. \n",
      "I received a sample pack with one of my recent orders off bb.com and decided to give it a try. I'm not a fan of pre-workouts with caffeine or stims because all they do for me is give me a buzz of energy for 15min then they die out and im left completely crashed out at the end of my workout, and on top of that I cant sleep at night. However taking C4 was a different story. I took half the packet which is 1 serving and it did the job perfectly. I had clean steady energy throughout my workout and best of all no crash at the end. Highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Just love it. All the focus and the energy is there when I need it.\n",
      "C4 simply gets the job done....much more intense then jack... i always take 2 scoops... makes an hour - hour and half feel great....as far as the value i mean 2 scoops should get you over a months worth even if your working out 5times a week...Assault is around the same price and is gone in less than a month.... icy blue razz... not the best flavor but i've tried watermelon and its great....def recommend C4\n",
      "this is a great product!, good pumps and good clean energy, the watermelon flavor i think is the best out of the others that ive tried, this is on pre-workout is on my top three ds craze, 1mr and cellucor c4 all these are awesome preworkouts give em a try you wont be disappointed and ofcourse bodybuilding.com is great really fast shipping\n",
      "Taste great much better than Muscle Pharm Assualt fruit punch\n",
      " Strongly reccomend.\n",
      "C4 is simply amazing! I feel like I can lift the gym after using this. I worked out for 3 hours this morning. After the 2nd hour I looked at the clock...I thought I had been in the gym for 30 minutes. Simply amazing!\n",
      "Used the sample bodybuilding.com sent me with my latest order, so I gave it a shot. I was super pleased with the results. I felt better than usual deep into my workout, without actually feeling any of the usual physical effects I usually get after drinking a preworkout. I wasn't keen on the watermelon, but they seem to have a varied selection of flavors. I will buy this product.\n",
      "I was a little skeptical about any pre-workout supplement, I mean how much of a difference was it really going to make.  So after reading the reviews on taste and effectiveness of all the top pre-workout products I decided on C4.  HOLY CRAP does this stuff work!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is great...sweet/tart, like liquid candy...seriously its a treat.  What really impresses me about the effectiveness is how I can come home from a full day of work and be beat, have no motivation to workout or do anything strenuous.  But I've quickly learned that 20 mins after I suck down a single serving of C4..my body is full of energy and my mind is full of drive...Now I HAVE to workout whereas 20 minutes ago I was pondering a nap!  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm focused and intense when lifting, muscle control seems easy, and despite lifting alone at my house I have the drive to push myself for those extra reps and keep adding new exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "After ripping through my workout in record time, I'm still full of  energy.  Now after lifting I'll go outside and do some yard work, run the dogs, build something, just do whatever, because I WANT to do something productive.  And here I was just about to take a nap.  You think this makes my wife happy???      \n",
      "\n",
      "this product didn't work in myself... i never felt the extra energy.... i really prefer NO Xplode And the Curse...\n",
      "I have been using this for more than a year now. Of course while cycling with it but this is a great product I recommended it to all my friends and would recommend it to anyone who want that extra edge in the gym, be safe with it though\n",
      "I received samples of this from bb.com and loved it so much I purchased a bottle of it &amp;amp; have been my go-to pre-workout supp\n",
      " NEXT HEAR OF BETTER RESULTS AND WAY MORE ENERGY.\n",
      "\n",
      "I try not to take the same pre workout all the time and this is definetely one of the best in my roto. C4 and Jack3d are probably the 2 best that have worked for me. I think both have worked better than NO Explode and i'm about to try MP Assualt.\n",
      "This product tastes great, and I have seen some excellent results in my workouts.\n",
      "If you like the flavor of Watermelon Jolly Ranchers, then you will like the watermelon flavor of this product, identical taste.\n",
      "I have been a loyal customer of another brand for a long time now and swore by their products. I received a sample of C4 extreme watermelon and decided to give it a shot and was blown away. I felt it working within minutes and had one of the BEST workouts I've ever had...in my life. I broke through plateaus and felt like I could lift a car. At the same cost for the pwo I was using, I'll Definetly be switching to C4 extreme. The pump from the no3 was great. The watermelon flavor tastes EXACTLY like a watermelon jolly rancher!\n",
      "AMAZING TASTE. GREAT PWO SUPP\n",
      "By far the best pre workout I have ever used. I had a bad experience eith a cellucor product in the past so I was a little hesitant about the C4. But the taste was great, it mixed extremely easy. I reacted in about 20 minutes and it sustained (HARD RUSH) for about 45 minutes for me then it tapered to nothing after about 1.5 hours. I got a good tingle from it, with good focus. I don't see how you could go wrong with this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really feel the difference with this pre-workout.  I have tried NO XPLODE (which works but makes me feel shaky), Amino Energy (by Optimum - decent) and some cheap stuff.  I have no desire/need to try anything else, for now at least.\n",
      "This is a great product that does what it says!  I have a lot more energy at the gym now and my muscles don't get fitigued as fast.\n",
      "I've been using this for a while now mainly because it is affordable but I'm still searching for a Pre that doesn't require multiple servings to satisfy me\n",
      "i got this as a free sample with another order and let it sit around for a whiile.  I didn't really feel it when I was getting ready to hit the gym today so I figured I'd see what this would do.  Drank it, and killed my workout.  I felt more explosive than usual and was considering throwing in a few more sets because I had so much energy.  Immediately ordered more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blue razz tasted like those blue raspberry lolly pops, with a slight artificial sweetener taste that became less noticable over time.  Next time I'll probably mix with more than the recommended amount of water to reduce the sweetness.\n",
      "When I'm feeling sl****ish before a morning workout, C4 is my go-to boost. I'm able to run that extra mile and push out that extra few reps. It doesn't make me feel jittery and there is no crash afterwards. \n",
      "I must say I had never tried a product with creatine before, but with my last order through body building I received a free sample. I tried it out today. I must say I was impressed after I came home fro work I had no energy or will to lift but I took it anyway just to get on the track to starting my workout and half an hour latter I am feeling great and ready to go, not the jittery ready to go you get from too much caffeine either. I preceded to have one of the best lifts I have had in the past few weeks when I thought today was just going to be one of those days where I was feeling weak. I am defiantly planning on including this in my supplementing in the near future.\n",
      "Great boost for my workout. Whoever said that the watermelon tastes like jolly ranchers on here (and thus clinched my decision to try it) was dead on. I find it to be a little on the sweet side with the recommended 6 or so oz. of water, but diluted to 10 or 12 it's just perfect.  \n",
      "\n",
      "i doubted c4 at first and after the first time using it im hooked. easily the best preworkout ive used. doesnt give and overpowering feeling but gives the perfect energy boost i need after a day of work to hit the weights hard. ill be using c4 for a long time. love it!\n",
      "Not the best flavor, but not too bad either.  Awesome pumps, and if your looking to go beast mode at the gym this is one of the best.  Tried Jack 3D, but this is 100 times better.  1M.R. is the only thing that comes close to this.  \n",
      "Im on C4 Extreme now because Bodybuilding.com no longer carriers Jack3d and Im too lazy to make a new account on tigerfitness.com just to buy Jack3d.\n",
      "\n",
      " I took two scoops just like I do with Jack3d. Waited 25 minutes and started lifting. I didnt notice much on first set. However, my second and 3rd sets improved by a couple reps. \n",
      "\n",
      "It must take bit for the stuff to reach the muscles?\n",
      "\n",
      " Awesome product, the only reason it doesnt get a 10/10 from me is because of the Beta Alanine. Im used to the amount of BA in Jack3d.\n",
      "\n",
      " However, if you take 2 scoops of C4 ure getting 3 grams of BA! THATS A CRAZY AMOUNT! LOL\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoy the energy I get from this product. I have been using it the last two weeks and have had great workouts when using it. I personally prefer Jack3d, but this is a close second.\n",
      "I love it!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Incredible!! Makes for a great workout!\n",
      "Not bad at all. I primarily have used Jack3d(old formula) for my pre-workout supplement so compared to that I would say the initial energy is less with this one, but the energy is sustained throughout the workout and I found it to be less jittery than Jack3d and it also had less of a crash. Taste was pretty good as well.\n",
      "My favorite pre workout the initial pumps are not quite up to par with usplabs jack3d but I find C4 last longer and tends to give me great focus in the gym.  It is also much better than any other preworkout I've used at giving me that second wind to push through tough sets.\n",
      "I've tried jack and BSN N.O, however this product does not give you the pump (or a pump) like the two previous. I have consume the max amount allowed which is 3 scoops half hour before workout without an ounce of excitement. This product is heavily marketed which is the only reason why it sells so well. The taste is pretty good, but im sure its due to the high amount of sugar added.\n",
      "This was better than expected! I took 3/4 of a serving and it was just like so of the other positive reviewers said. On my way to the gym I could feel my muscles tingling. My workout was intense! I never felt a crash either. This product worked exactly as described for me and I'm looking forward to enjoying the results.\n",
      "Sometimes I just leave the container open as an air refreshner... but seriously not a bad product as far as preworkouts go. But I don't know how much is just a placebo effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tryed just about every pre-workout suppliment out there and I have to say that I'm not that big a fan of this stuff. I was excited upon ordering this, thinking it would be absolutley fantastic but was disappointed. It was very weak and not strong at all. This pre-workout suppliment I would recommend only if you are a weightlifter who focuses more on light and moderate sets of weights. This did anything but help me get a boost on my heavy days, but only to make me fatigued after the 1st two sets. Plus wicked bad crash. Made me feel like a psychotic moody nutbag the whole month. WASTE OF MONEY\n",
      "This is a very good Pre workout product. Give you a very clean and focused energy that really helps you through your workouts, but I have noticed a tolerance to C4. I have to switch between mixing the product in water and taking a scoop directly by mouth with a mouthful of water: Other wise the product is not effective.\n",
      "Great product! Love the concentrated version of this supplement. Really good value and price doesn't compare with other pre workouts. C4 also has an amazing taste and goes down smooth. Also saw gains in the weight room and can't wait to see what else cellucor has to offer!\n",
      "I have been using c4 for about 3 weeks i take 2 scoops for my training sessions I see much of the reviews it works great for most of you guys but for me it just makes me sleepy no energy the only thing it works is in the focus it gives me a good focus on my training.\n",
      " But overall the product works, it tastes great. It does what it's supposed to do. This product accompanied with regular exercise and an attempt to eat healthier will help you reach your goals faster.\n",
      "i have tried over 30 different pre workouts and this one is favourite, amazing energy, no crash, good mood, great pump. everything 10/10 but the taste is like 100000000000000/10 taste is unreal good. my top 3 pre workouts are c4, craze, jack3d\n",
      "Great product to get me going at the gym. I wake up early and at work all day, usually thinking about sleep. Right after I take this on my way to the gym, when I'm there I get going! Definitely gives me the energy I need. And the new watermelon flavor tastes like a Jolly Rancher. \n",
      "i have been using c4 extreme for about a week. good energy through out my workouts.no jitters and no crash. i will definitely buy another bottle. icy blu razz taste good.\n",
      "First of all this is the best tasting preworkout I've ever had. As for it's function, I definitely feel alert 15-20 minutes after I take it in the morning. When in the gym I feel focused and energized. I've tried a few preworkouts and this is one of the better ones so far.\n",
      "Pretty good stuff, definitely enjoyed using this and will most likely buy it again. Flavor was decent and it also provided a lot of energy for my workout.\n",
      "Good energy boost. Comparable to Jack3D. I've worked up to 2 scoops before i head to the gym and it lasts for about an hour. More reps, better focus, and if you're feeling a little sl****ish or lazy before you go, this will definitely put you in the zone. Overall, I rated this 8 out of 10, simply because you get used to it quickly. But a great pre-workout. Highly recommend it.\n",
      "this product is one of the best per-workout poster I have used. Orange flavor is great and similar to the natural orange juice taste. I have using it with Animal pump and does not give me the desire power. So, I would like to I ask if any body suggest to take it alone or what???\n",
      "Gives me a good swole pump in the gym. Gives me the energy i need to push through my workout and has good results. No crash afterwards either. Im actually in a better mood after my workout. Some pre workouts i have taken make me crash and have a bad mood.\n",
      "i have been taking this about a week and love it.gives you the pump and gives me the energy to do another rep.great stuff\n",
      "I tried this on recommendation from a friend. Sorry man, but I wasn't too impressed. It's alright, but it doesn't hit me like others do. It's worth a try if you have the spare change... things like this seem to be rather subjective. But I probably won't buy it again.\n",
      "Gave me a pretty good pump makes you focus like crazy. No tingle and tastes great.\n",
      "I really enjoy taking this product after a hour of eating something. Gives the food time to digest. Then it is great after a half hour of taking it. I have energy for at least 2 hours of working out and then even after going home. No crash at all and it mixes great and taste great as well!!!!! It also is not expensive which is great for a guy on a budget. Also take as least 2 scoops because 1 will not do it unless you are new to this product,or working out!!! Enjoy and I hope the review helps ya out.\n",
      "amazing product much better in comparison to neurocore 1scoop does the job for u...i tried it for the first time the energy ,intensity and the pump was amazing and lasted throughout my workout this is what i wanted.\n",
      "The dose with two scoops gives some tingling, but is an excellent pre-workout.\n",
      "The Pre-workout that works best for me. I've tried Jack3d, Assault, 1MR, NoExplode, SuperPump, Black Magic... but nothing compares\n",
      "This is the best pre work out i have tried yet, and i tried allmost everything. I gave my brother my musclepharm assault and gave away my n o xplode cause they just dont compare, cellucor best company out there.\n",
      "I have tried many preworkout supplements and this by far holds very well and is at the top of the chain. I would say the side by side competitor would be Jack3d. I have tried other preworkout supps ( MP Assault, White Flood, NO Xplode) and they did not hold up to my expections. I felt it starting to kick in within 5-10 minutes. The taste was basically that of any preworkout supp, it was actually drinkable and tasted decent, did not have to choke down. It was a smooth transition from low to high and stayed with me for duration for workout. I had a smooth come down as well, no crash. Clear concentration and thinking and got a nice pump with it. Very impressed, would definitely recommend to someone looking for a clean energy boost. My grade: A \n",
      "taste just like kool aid.. gets me pumped up to the max ! best pre work out ive ever tooken \n",
      "This stuff is phenomenal! I use this stuff prior to every workout and I feel great! I can't imagine using anything else. Ive been taking for 2 weeks now and can see how it makes my body look as well. Would suggest to anyone looking for a great pre-workout boost!\n",
      "Cellucor c4 extreme has been the first pre workout I have ever tried. I usually don't need a boost but lately I had hit the hugest plateau on my bench press. The first time I took this stuff I felt great in the gym and had no problem knocking out reps and doing my 4x5 workout. I decided to max test about a week after I had started using this product and my bench shot up 10 pounds. The amount of pumps and focus I have felt in the gym have allowed me to really get the job done when pumping iron. DRINK A LOT OF WATER THOUGH. This stuff will make you feel tingly if you don't get enough water so make sure you drink about a gallon of water a day when taking this stuff. Overall great product and it has quickly become a must when i am doing the smolov routine for squats.\n",
      "I've tried a lot of pre-workout supplements and this one is one of the best. It seems to be just the right dose for me. I don't get the nausea or headaches like I have with other pre's.\n",
      "The watermelon flavor is amazing! If you like the watermelon Jolly Rancher, you'll love this! I usually chug this stuff just to get it down but the watermelon is good enough to sip on!\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is great. Does exactly what a pre-workout is suppose to. I would recommend this to anyone. \n",
      "works really well quick acting, taste Really well with just 8 oz. of water. i give it a 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "very good\n",
      "Works really good for a great complete workout. Plus the icy blue razz tastes like kool aid!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably the best &quot;concentrated&quot; pre-workout supplement out there. I have tried many different products. The taste is great as well, and when you need a crazy pump throw in some NO3 stacked with it and watch out, amazing energy. Blue Razz is awesome, I love it.\n",
      "I take it 20-30 minutes before workout, like it states to do. I don't know if I &quot;feel&quot; it. But about an hour after my workout I feel like I'm gong 25 miles an hour. Taste of the product is great. Thinking about doing 2 scoops and seeing if I notice a difference\n",
      "good one!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that bad of a product. It lacks some things that I like in my pre workouts. It is a good base though.\n",
      "best pre workout ever! gives me great energy for a 3 mile run everyday\n",
      "I love this product the price isn't bad compared to some other pre-workouts and it gives me that energy that is just an extra pump and head rush for lifting only bad thing is the flavor its like ch****ing vodka but you get used to it.\n",
      "most intense pre-workout I have ever taken. I have taken some other nitric oxide pre-workouts before and this one is awesome. I feel the supplement kick in about 10 minutes after taking it and by the time I get to the gym, I'm ready to get a good pump.\n",
      "i would recommend this product to someone who would like to gain muscle. i started using it 2 weeks ago and i already see changes. if your the kind of person who need a pump before your workout this is not a good product. i felt the pump the 1st time but after that i never feel it.\n",
      "Taste is amazing. Have tried Fruit Punch and Icy Blue Razz and FP is the way to go. Within 10 minutes had had the tingles and was in the zone. Crazy vascularity, especially when stacked with NO3 Black Chrome. Would recommend for anyone.\n",
      "I got a free sample of this when I placed an order with Bodybuilding.com. I read the directions and had just 1 serving instead of the 2 servings in the sample. I had a good workout and very minor soreness the next days. I bought 2 5-serving bags and got 1 free, and used 2 rounded servings to the line on the scoop and had a good workout. The Blue Razz tastes good! Didn't really feel tingly at all. Because of the Creatine Nitrate, I had a cramp in my calf muscle but ate half of a potassium pill and some orange juice and that took care of it. I wasn't sure if I was to go to the line or go to the top of the scoop, so tonight I had 2 scoops to the top of the scoop and what a difference! I felt tingly like pins and needles all over and also drank Intrafuse during my workout and had a really good workout. The Intrafuse has potassium in it so I hope that helps prevent any cramping.\n",
      "Great product!  Pink lemonade is the best flavor but bodybuilding doesn't cary it.  C4 is similar to Jack3d without the side effects!  I needed two scoops to get the best workouts.      \n",
      "I would recommend C4 Extreme without reservation; I take this product early in the morning and am able to stay mentally focus in addition to increasing reps and sets. I have seen an increase in the ability to add more weight after each week and have felt stronger. The taste is tremendously great and the best part is that you only need four ounces of water per scoop; one scoop to start out with is a good start then after building a tolerance then two scoops could be added. The downfall that I have experienced is an increase of the perception &quot;scary voice&quot; reason, not a clue and have experienced mild itching. Overall result taking C4 extreme will only help you achieve your goals...so go online and buy this product to start achieving your goals to be successful.\n",
      " Oh and the flavor taste is amazing. Taste like fruit punch Gatorade.\n",
      "\n",
      "By far one of the best products I've ever used for a pre-workout. It didn't make me sick like a lot of the other products do. I got a really sensitive stomach and this product didn't bother me at all!!! The taste was spot on and it really was sweet. It didn't have that bitter taste you come to expect from a supplement. It was a little chalky but I liked it. It wasn't thick and mixed well. The pumps were great and trust me... It will kick Jack3d out of the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing flavor! Perfect boost! C4 is perfect for a long  workout.\n",
      "I received several packs of samples of this and I finally got around to using them.  I will definitely be ordering some.  \n",
      "\n",
      "At 1 serving (or half the packet), I don't have the same energy that I did with SuperPump, but it does still get me moving.  This is important since I lift at 5:00 AM.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The thing I really like about C4 is that, unlike with SuperPump or Universal Storm, I don't get the super dumps for the rest of the day.  I apparently have a very sensitive stomach and SP, Storm and even SizeOn really cause problems for me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With C4, I get some nice energy for my workout and no side effects.  I might try a double dose once I get a tub of this.  \n",
      "I love this product, just finished my first tub of Blue Razz and just bought orange. Cellucor never seems to disappoint. I highly recommend this product \n",
      "\n",
      "i have to tell anyone that is thinking about buying a cellucor product dont hesitate. I was never a believer in preworkouts . but i can honestly say im hooked on c4. I have always heard people tell me about this tingling feeling they get after taking c4 and i was skeptical. well when i tried it i knew exactly what the hype was about. now please dont think that taking c4 will lift the weights for you. you still have to put the effort in to your workouts but it gives you that edge to say let me do one more set or one more rep. and its that small difference that makes a big change in how you get to where you want to be. great job cellucor.\n",
      "Excellent pre-workout supplement....tastes like fruit punch, but so sweet that you have to gag it down. More importantly, the pump and energy I get from this is incredible. I have noticed significant strength, and more importantly, endurance gains using C4. I am able to hammer out those late workout heavy sets with vigor, instead of dragging ***. I have to literally make myself leave the gym some days to prevent over-training. Additionally, I have noticed a superior pump and improved muscularity. A bonus is that I don't experience any type of crash post workout.....just fatigue from being able to train so hard and heavy for an extended period of time....best pre -workout I have used over the years no question...\n",
      "I started taking C4 about 5 weeks ago and it is seriously all I need to get that amped energy and pump. The niacin is mild and for me the pins &amp;amp; needles in my skin went away after the 2nd use. My workout partner however still feels it each time he takes it but he said he likes the feeling. All in all awesome stuff because it is pumped with creatine as well. I've only tried the Orange flavor and it's delicious.\n",
      "I usually never rate or review a product but I must say that this is worth it. As far as overall rating, I give it a 10/10 because it does what it says it does. I have been on Jack3d for the longest time and have tried various other NO products like BSN's NO Explode. They just don't compare to this. As far as performance combined with taste, this is the best stuff I have ever tried. Cellucor C4 Extreme will be in my supplement cabinet for a while. Tastes great and performs even better! \n",
      "\n",
      " The energy is nothing special for a stim junkie, like myself... That's probably all that's holding it back from a 10.\n",
      "This stuff gets you PUMPED to workout!!!  Tons of caffeine, so if you work out late like I do then don't think you'll be going to bed early at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "I get great workouts.  \n",
      "No Jitters.\n",
      "LOVE IT!\n",
      "\n",
      "Best pre workout supplement i have taken. It kinda gives you a tingling feeling and you itch for a 1-2 mins but for me that's when I know im ready to go. No explode was OK but after a week was feeling no effects, and jackd3d was my least favorite only made me focused and could think clearly, but in the weight room felt kinda lethargic\n",
      "The company's review is correct.  This stuff is amazing.  It really does make you want to do more than you thought you could.  Last night I sat down to do incline bench presses, not really into it at all, by the end of the set I was ready to throw on another 15 reps.  Focus, confidence, strength.  Amazing and tastes good too.  Nothing bitter and not nasty flavors.  Just like drinking a glass of gatorade.\n",
      "Great pre workout product. Been using this product for a few months with no complaints. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Defiantly try this. TASTES AMAZING and works even better than it tastes!!!\n",
      "I love it, it is working pretty good for me, a lot of energy and it helps to go through my toughest work outs. Taste is the best. but the only thing that is not making this product perfect is that my body is getting use to id really fast, now I am drinking 1 scoop and a half, but I don't want to jump to 2 scoops....\n",
      "This is a great product. Thou I have to say you'll get this sensation much like when a part of your body falls sleep, usually arms, hands, legs, and you get this tingle like sensation, well its kind of like that. I actually started to use this while working out and its a great pump ... during boot camp classes taking a couple of zips here and there is a good re-energizer to keep on going.\n",
      "This is probably the first preworkout I've ever used besides some thermogenic stuff.....awesome pump and energy hits you about 15-30 minutes after taking it. I dropped it just one point from perfect only because it'll make you feel like your sunburned for the early part of your workout. I've heard ACG3 does this too so I guess its not unnatural. Great stuff! I would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to get back in shape for summer!\n",
      "Great pre-workout. Gets me going and keeps me going long after my workout.  No crash and no stomach issues.\n",
      "I have tried many many pre workouts and I'm on my way to try all of them and find the very best one. Out of all the ones I have tried, this has by far been the best. 15ish minutes after I take it I get hyper, focused, and ready to lift more than ever. Trust me, this product is totally worth it.\n",
      "I got a sample of C4 from bodybuilding.com on a previous order and from the first time i tried it i knew it was a great product. It gives you a great feeling of focus and strength, it helps power through tough work outs. The flavor isn't the best but you i only mix it in a quick shot and take it as fast as possible.\n",
      "Best pre-workout I've tried so far. You drink it and in exactly 30 minutes you start feeling this INCREDIBLE itching sensation through your veins... as if your turning into The Hulk!!!!.... RECOMMENDED!!! \n",
      "Great pump for very long period of time, vascularity its excellent, strength is tremendous, I feel no crash after workout or any after effect that will make me change my mind about this product. Its a great supplement that you dont need gigantic servings on workingout days. I recomment this product to those who wish to workout smarter,stronger, and harder.\n",
      "I used this product to give it a try, after coming off 1MR and previously Jack3d.  I can tell you that C4 Extreme doesnt even come close to the same intensity and training that the other mentioned products have.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was next to zero real muscle pump, and little to no focus.  I tried upping my servings, and apart from a small 'buzz' during a workout.. it was pretty flat.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I definately recommend other preworkout supps over this one. \n",
      "Wow I like C4 this is a good pre workout supplement I noticed a gain in how many more pounds I could lift! Great supplement I will repost if anything changes. Also this was my first day using it.\n",
      "This product took a few weeks for me to feel the full advantage of taking it but after week 2, I have seen an increased level of energy. I can feel the product in my system after 20 minutes of consuming it and it really helps with my cardio workout after I have done 1.5 hours of lifting. Will continue to use.\n",
      "I have been using C4 for a little over a month. Im gonna be honest with you, it is a great product. It gives you the focus and pumps that are needed to get a good, strong work out. It taste pretty good with no after taste. The only thing I dont like is that it doesnt last very long, 45 to 60mins its about how long it last.\n",
      "Its the best Pre-workout I've taken.\n",
      "Here's why.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Its strong, but I didn't get jittery\n",
      "2. It's condensed, small container, small scoop,  easy to transport.\n",
      "3. It's  cheap, on par with Jack3d, half the price of Assault\n",
      "4. Taste,  like bitter or sour soda, not wretched like N.O Explode.\n",
      "5. Doesn't have 5g of creatine. \n",
      "Taste is amazing and it gets me going!\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't tried many different pre workout supplements but I have to say this product by far is my favorite it gives me the energy I need while giving me great pumps not to mention the blue razz tastes great in almost anything you mix it with\n",
      "Great product! Its a better taste than the Icy Blue Razz and gets me through some extreme workouts w/o the jittery feeling! Reccomend taking this with Cellucor NO3... Great combo!\n",
      "This stuff is delicious, Icy Blue Razz I find myself trying to get the last few drops from the shaker every time. 10 minutes and the tingle comes, crank the tunes and do work, I love the clear ingredients listed, no maltodextrin, this stuff is great. I have used Assault extensively but wanted something without the proprietary blends. I will try 1MR next time, just to try something new, and because I really liked the sample i got of it last time. I would recommend this product though for sure.\n",
      "This is hands down my favorite pre-workout supplement right now. I take this, usually in double-doses and I then can pull through a 40 minute run and then 1 1/2 hours of lifting. I'll still have energy at the end and be alert. My mind may be willing but my body is weak. I also love telling people that I drink C4 like kool-aid\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: \n",
      "- Energy blend is fantastic\n",
      "- NO3 gives me a greater pump than NO2 \n",
      "- Tastes pretty good\n",
      "- Contains 1g of Creatine per serving\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "- Some of the ingredients won't absorb and stay at the bottom of the cup... granular and they annoy me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pre wotrk out is the least effective one I have used. I would recommend Assult, over C4. The C4 just felt like a lot of niacin no real pump, or focus compaired to Assult.\n",
      "Taste like kool-aid. Definitely would recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just tried this product earlier today, i loved it. I couldn't sit still, it made my muscles very tense and I had a lot of energy. i tried the CL whiteflood last week, but it didn't do anything for me. I am sticking with c4, though it's more expensive than the competitors' NO products, it's definitely worth the money. I gave a scoop to 4 of my employees and they all felt the tingly sensation along with the pump. it tastes like candy.\n",
      "This is one of the best pre workouts I've ever tried! it tastes like kool aid and the energy was fantastic!\n",
      "This is a great tasting pre-workout that works great. I typically use NO-xplode, but decided to change it up and try something new. After two weeks of using this I definitely notice a difference in the gym with better pumps.\n",
      "I have tried both this flavor and the fruit punch. They are both very tasty, like kool-aid. Energy wise this stuff is pretty good. I took 1.5 scoops this morning before my work out and I had energy coming out the wazoo. Compared to Jack3d I would say it is above on energy levels, but slightly below on duration. Both have zero crash afterwards. This product (to the best of my knowledge) does not contain DMAA either which is a big plus for me.\n",
      "Awesome product. Started using it around 2 months ago in December. Definitely gives you a good pump to put in a good workout. I actually started trying just one scoop before running my usual 5 miles and it really gets you going! The tiny scoop of the highly concentrated formula is also convenient, the whole 60 servings comes in about a 2 cup plastic container. The taste could be better though, I've tried the fruit punch in a sample and liked it better. The dye for the fruit punch is one of those obnoxiously-red-stain-anything-it-touches reds though. Hate that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice product can slightly increase strenght. But with fast during effect.\n",
      "In the first 15 minutes it gives a skin tingle sensation, pretty fine. But the mental focus could last more. I was expecting more.\n",
      " Since I started using C4, my energy level throughout my workout has greatly improved. If you feel like you have peaked in performance and you are curious in trying something to give you a boost, I would recommend this product. I wish I would have started using this sooner.\n",
      "The C4 Extreme is the best pre-drink I've ever had. The C4 Extreme is crazy ! I have more energy and feel so pumped and focused! I don’t want to quit – I can lift more than usual and put in more reps. The Blue Raz also tastes great !! I have others at my gym now hooked on it !\n",
      "Great taste, insane pump and not a bad price either... 10/10\n",
      " Wow, now that I come to think of it, comparing C4 to Jack3d, I give a slight edge to C4. Good stuff.\n",
      " Results: First week you'll really feel the effects, afterwards will have to up the dose. You may get diarrhea, as with any other like-product. Recommended over the competition.\n",
      "Awesome pump, coupled with NOX 3 from cellucor. Love these products. Hate fruit punch, Icy Blue Razz is pretty good. \n",
      "This Nitric Oxide is absolute real deal. Been using for about three weeks and LOVE the pump, focus, and power it provides for workout. I have used the N.O. Xplode 2.0 and while that is good stuff this i feel way better. Taste rocks, mixes well, hits hard!\n",
      "very good product\n",
      "takin this for the first time, impressive... all i got to say. thought i was going to have a headache because of the caffine and i dont drink anythink with caffine., but i didn't . had alittle tingling but man was i in the zone. didnt have that burning feeling in my legs doing leg extensions or squats. didnt crash at all after the workout. i started with 1 dose felt good then i went to 1 and a half and felt good. so i went to 2 dose. all in three days. great product\n",
      "This is a solid pre-workout. It gives a pretty good pump, and you still get the beta-alanine tingle that everyone loves even after your first week on it. I take two servings and that seems to do about right. I feel like I have more strength through my workouts and a little more focus. To be honest, the focus factor is where this product lacks. I have felt more focused on other products. However, the pump... and the extra energy are good! Focus goes up a little, just not as much as I'd like. And Icy Blue Razz tastes freaking great!\n",
      "I was never more focused and intense as when I took this pre-workout product. Noticeably different workout, if I forgot this product due to time constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "No joke, a few times I had to focus on the intensity and dial it down a bit or risk injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "10/10\n",
      "Admittedly, this is the first pre-workout drink I have every taken, so I cannot compare it others. I can however, testify that it meets my expectations. At times when I feel I have normal energy, C4 gives me extra energy and I am lifting more, and getting in longer workouts. On days when I have low energy, C4 gives me enough to get through the workout. After 15 minutes of drinking it, my face starts to feel tingly/prickly until I start working out. I find that to be an acceptable mild downside for being able to maximize my workouts. At 165-170lbs, I find that I need about 1.5 scoops which gives me about 20 servings.\n",
      " Had an absolute monster workout, and I've been buying Jack3d nearly around the time it came out. Next time, I'm gettin' this stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me begin by saying I've tried over 10 different pure workouts. I was taking N.O. Explode 2.0, I've taken assault, jacked, white flood, juggernaut, 1.m.r, neurocore.. The mixability is amazing. 10/10. Taste is blue raz-10/10, fruit punch 9.5/10 and orange 8/10. I would recommend this because it uses creating nitrate and has no proprietary blends as do assault and n.o explode. Great product- you'll be impressed after the first workout. My first time bb.com sent me a sample of it, I took it and after about 10-12 minutes my back was tingling and my veins were expanded. This one is my #1 pwo I've tried. Too much unessasary ingredients in assault or n.o. Explode\n",
      "This stuffs great. I felt so powerful at the gym and was unstoppable. It tastes good too. Only downside, is about 10 minutes after drinking it i take a massive dump. But then feel energized -__-\n",
      "A must have for the gym. Everyone has their days where they just DO NOT have the energy to go. Well, when you lack motivation this will help you find it. I recommend this to everyone. Some of my friends had the Assault pre workout and liked it until they got a sample pack of C4. There is no other pre-workout like this. The taste, the energy, the results, this is the total package as far as a pre-workout is concerned.\n",
      " I rate it 9/10 because I've had to use 2servings to feel the full effect.\n",
      "\n",
      " for shape and size :)\n",
      "This is the 3rd pre-workout ive tried (N.O. Xplode and Jack3d) and this is by far the best of the 3! With the previous two i had to keep increasing my usage cause my body would build up a tolerance and this has not happened after now my 4th container of c4. I get way better pumps and can push out more reps with c4 than of the others as well. The orange is a pretty decent flavor. I never had to force myself to get it all down. I prefer the pink lemonade over the orange however.\n",
      "Taste was excellent! Follow the directions for a sustained workout, you can almost feel it as soon as you finish drinking the pre workout boost!!\n",
      "I had a couple single serving packets from my last order. It worked magic! Have used Noxipro up to this point. C4 over does it. Will continue to take my Noxivol though. Best not to take the two combined. Depending on your workout, take pill form either first dose after workout, or second dose same.\n",
      "Blue Raspberry C4 has an amazing flavor. If I could drink this instead of water and have no consequences I definitely would. I look forward to going to the gym, because I look forward to drinking this before my workouts. At the gym I get a really good burst of energy and pretty good focus. I've had better pre-workouts, but I've most definitely had worse! Some pre-workouts knot up my stomach during certain excercises like squats, but C4 doesn't do that all. And the flavor really helps to make this an amazing addition to your stack.\n",
      " C4 is bananas. Within 30 minutes of taking it, I started getting the lovely tingles around my neck and scalp. By the hour, I am at the peak of my workout and the C4 really gives me that charge I need. If you like Jack3d, I would try C4. IMO, it's the superior product.\n",
      "This stuff is intense!! I have to take 3 scoops of Jacked to equal the effects of one serving of this! Impressed!\n",
      "another one of the &quot;you only need this little tiny scoop products&quot;, but this one seems realistic (unlike &quot;jack3d&quot;, which i thought was either useless or needed one of those big protein scoops, that are only slightly smaller than a child's sand shovel that he uses at the beach). i actually can't remember which flavor i have, but i am sure that it's not orange. anyway, 2 scoops of this stuff and i feel pretty good -- not wired, freaky, and &quot;am i gonna die?&quot;, like VPX redline, but just good enough to work out hard w/o worrying that my heart is getting ready to explode. definitely feel the &quot;niacin flush&quot; in my face, so if you can't handle that, stick to one scoop. mixes great, tastes above average, and does a decent job of getting me &quot;dialed in&quot;. it's probably what i will buy next time...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Overall- Seriously, GREAT preworkout. I don't think its meant for that huge pump...though if you want that, just add some NO3 to C4 and you're set!...but it definitely delivers on the energy, focus and drive while at the gym so you can accomplish what you set out for.\n",
      "The only other pre-workout supplement I have to compare this to is Jack3d. I've been using C4 for approximately 6 months, and I absolutely love it. I love the &quot;tingles&quot; and the extra energy and pump I get from using this product. I used the Jack3d for about a month, and after my workout, I would have a huge caffeine crash. This isn't the case for me with the C4. The Blue Razz and Fruit Punch are great tasting (don't care for the Orange much). I'm not going to rant and rant about the C4, just giving an honest review, because I know different stuff works for different people. This just so happens to work great for me! Cheers to Cellucor!\n",
      "Without a doubt this is the BEST pre-workout formula I've taken. It mixes extremely well in a shaker,tastes great, and the results are amazing. EXPLOSIVE WORKOUTS are common place! Hi energy levels lasting through out without crash or let down. NO jitters,shakes, or munchies. This is a QUALITY product.\n",
      "I have been taking this for about 2 weeks now and i am not disappointed. this is a GREAT preworkout. I have awesome pumps, crazy stamina/energy, and my favorite part; the beta-tingles as i call them. Definitely wroth the money and the blue razz favor is AWESOME! smells like cotton candy although i will admit its strong but its sooooo good. 1.5-2 scoops with 4oz of water/per scoop, perfect.\n",
      "tastes alot like fruit punch cool aid and has really no after taste. It works well in the gym. Although i doubled the serving size from one to two scoops to get a good result. would recommend to anyone just switch around. seems to work best to use this and when its out try something else so you don't get used to it.\n",
      "Best pre-workout supplement I have taken. Great energy, great focus, and awesome pump. Much better then all other pre-workouts I have tried. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Intense energy and focus. I liked it just a little better than Jack3d.\n",
      "Tasted like cool aid I loved it and the workouts were amazing to\n",
      "I have tried so many brands of pre-workout... Jack3d, Hemorage, Juggernaut, 1MR, Assault and now it's Cellucor C4. Cellucor C4, by far, is the BEST!!! I'm serious. Assault gave me stomach upset and runs. Hemorage doesn't give me the pump anymore after 2 weeks of use. For Cellucor C4, each time I use it, I feel the pump and it makes me wanna do even more. I can see some growth already even it's only the 5th time i use it and muscles are harder when I stack it with creatine monohydrate. I use about 1.5 scoop to make me feel the push even more so I can lift abit more and do an extra set. I may consider stacking with NO3 chrome soon to get the vascularity I want. I strongly recommend Cellucor C4, and I feel the power rushing in after 30mins I take it and doing my warm up set\n",
      "I can't comment on the effects of this product because its taste was so offensive that I couldn't drink it. I ended up pouring it out. Frankly, I'd settle for a little genuine sugar in a product like this if it would improve the taste.\n",
      "Great product, the only thing I didnt liked about it is that I had to take 2 servings to get the results I need,and that makes the product expensive for me, since I get only 15 servings like that. I had no crash, even after 3 hours fo taking it, I felt very alert.\n",
      "I normal don't take pre-workout sups because I get the jitters really easy. This product however works fantastic for me. I now take it before every workout and before every softball game. I only take 1 serving and it kicks in around 15-30 mins later depending on how much food I have eaten.\n",
      "This is a superior product that works very well. It is my favorite pre-workout supplement.\n",
      "I have been using pre-workout supps since NO-Explode was introduced locally in Florida in the mid-2000s. (back when they had the holographic labels). SInce then I have tried just about everything - of course Jacked3d, Assault, Super Pump, Beta-Cret etc. Nothing has come close to the feeling I get from C4 Extreme. Its a clean, pure rush and pump that literally keeps me going to a point past muscle failure. The best part is that I don't crash later and most importantly on off days when I don't take it, I don't get a headache or feel 'out of it'. No pre-workouts have ever worked so well for this long. On top of all of this it has to be the best tasting pre-workout avail. The only addition I would like to see is Citrulline Malate.\n",
      "I got this product as a sample packet with one of my orders. Always wanted to try it and i finally got the shot. All i can say is WOW! I've taken 1MR and jack3d, nothing compares to this product for sure. It has in a sense spoiled me to where i cant go back to 1MR or jack3d. I am definitely buying this product soon!!!\n",
      "Great taste good pump. Sometimes get the tingly feeling\n",
      "Wow-got absolutely NOTHING out of this. I work out at night so although I usually don't have a completely &quot;empty&quot; stomach, I only use a pre-w/o protein shake about 90 mins prior. Most other pre w/o supps do just fine this way but the C4? Nada. No energy, no noticeable change in pumps. Glad I got a promo code on this and only paid 20 bucks. Taste good but that's it. Back to Jack3d as it is always a guaranteed great w/o.\n",
      "\n",
      " Overall I think this is a terrific product, and have let several friends who use other pre-workouts try it, and they have all since ordered some.\n",
      "bottle lasted a long time with 60 servings and a small scoop\n",
      "This is the best thing since Eve. I tried many pre-workout, like jack3d, 1MR, Assault wich was very good too. But, the C4 is something else. The taste is so good I drink this thing all day :) Also, at the gym the energy level was 10 and its stay at that level the whole workout. The pump was terrific too, but the best thing with that is that there's no crash after the workout like all the other pre work. Too bad I can't rate it more than 10 cause it would be. Sorry if the sentences are a little wrong, i'm French. Woot Woot\n",
      "This is a great pre workout supplement. It gives me a very clear and focused energy opposed to other brands that make you jittery. You can feel the beta alanine tingles and the caffiene helps push out more reps without loosing as much energy. Tastes great and works very well.\n",
      "This is by far the best pre workout supplement that i have ever taken. The pump that you receive is absolutely amazing. Not only that, but the fact that it gives me enough energy to power through even the toughest workouts. It is kind of expensive which is the only downside to this supplement. This C4 extreme also has exceptionally good taste, which is hard to find in a good pre workout supplement. It is worth the price and i'm sure that once you try it you will love it.\n",
      "I wish the experts didn't recommend that you cycle off preworkouts because this is one product that tastes AMAZING and I love the extra reps I get in at the gym. I highly recommend C4 Extreme.\n",
      "I got a few samples through the mail from a supplement company ;) The taste was pretty good and I took 1 packet with 20oz water and within 10 minutes I started getting the ant bites all over. Got the the gym and immediately started to work out. I was focus all the way thru with good pumps but my ears were burning like crazy. After a good 2 hour workout I had a pounding headache and crashed. I felt as though my body was failing. This thing has so much Shizznit in it that it messes with you. Although it works I think it's overpowered and is the type of stuff that will shut down your kidneys. I'll find safer alternatives like EVP. My kidneys are hurting right now!\n",
      "Taste very good I got the &quot;ant bites&quot; but had a bad crash it might have something to do with the fact I took two servings the first time I ever took it other then that great work out great pumps\n",
      "\n",
      "Great energy and excellent flavor.I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "THE BEST STUFF!\n",
      "\n",
      "Works great and you know when it kicks in!\n",
      "C4 is GREAT! If taken correctly, about 15-20 minutes before your workout, you feel amazing! The niacin and Beta Alanine send a tingle all over your body, and you can really feel it in which ever muscle group you're working that day. If you are looking for more energy and focus, C4 is pre-workout product for you!\n",
      "love it\n",
      "Bodybuilding gave me a free sample of this and I LOVED it. I previously used jack3d but C4 had given me a lot more energy. The focus and pump wasn't as good as others but the amount of energy you get from this is crazy. Also, one of the best tasting pre-workouts out there in my opinion.\n",
      "This is an amazing pre-workout! I recommend this to anyone new to pre-workouts and veteran lifters alike. Amazing effects! I get super pumps and great overall workouts! Blue Raz is great, tastes just like cotton candy!\n",
      "I took 2 servings of this product today before workout. The blue rasberry tastes excellent, and I found that the product enhances strength more than other products I have used and produces no bad effects. I am 78 years old. James\n",
      "This is the best pre-workout on the market! All others FAIL in taste, length in time that it lasts, tingle, pump, focus. I love the blue raspberry. I would recommend this to ANYBODY. Be sure to take it seperate from food to get the maximum effect.\n",
      "This is the best tasting pre-workout I have tried. It gives me the most energy and focus out of all the pre-workouts I've tried. This is a great prduct.\n",
      "This has to be the best pre-workout on the market or at least one of the best that i have used! Although my body is starting to get used to it, it still has the energy and focus I need for my workouts. I usually take 2 - 2 1/2 scoops now to get the full effect but it does the trick ..... great taste, great solubility, and a great workout when you use C4!\n",
      "\n",
      "The best pre workout I have used 1MR and Jacked and not even those two compare what you feel and how dramatic your muscle gain will be. Do it! Take this product now!\n",

      "i have a lot of resistance for the stimulants and when i tried jack3d i had to take like 2-2 1/2 scoops to feel the same thing that i feel with this product just with 1 scoop and thats great for me, dont give me a lot of energy just a little bit but definitely i got more strenght and more focus in the gym with this product and for the final part i got to say it taste AMAZING\n",
      "I've tried all kinds of different pre-workouts over the past 4-5 years, and I must say Cellucor created a memorable one with C4. Smells great, tastes even greater. And guess what?? Feels great too. I found that I had solid focus and energy consitently throughtout the whole bottle of this stuff. I didn't have skin tingling (which I love!) everyday, but always felt &quot;on edge&quot; when I walked into the gym. Everyone reacts to supplements differently, but this is one I will recommend to all.\n",
      "I am very new to bodybuilding i have only been doing now for 3 months. I started using C4 Extreme going into my 2nd month of working out and i have to say that i noticed a huge difference in my focus and my energy that it gave me. Before i used it i tried Jack3d and Amino Energy, they both did the job for me but when it came to Amino Energy it was awesome but it is not primarily made to be used as just a pre-workout so i had to take about 3 scoops of it to get a kick and caused me to use up a whole container really fast. Now Jack3d worked awesome the first day that i was on it but then the next day i got nothing out of it. I was very inconsistent on if it was gonna work for me or not. when it worked it was awesome. NOw with C4 Extreme i have been sticking to one scoop a day and it works everyday and i never have to worry about it not helping me. Another awesome thing is that it kicks in instantly which is great cause i don't have to wait 30 min till i can go work out. I get great pumps when i'm working out with it. The taste is amazing it taste like kool-aid. The only negative thing about it is that the packaging seemed to let moisture in and caused some of it to solid up and swell a little but that didn't effect to much till i got to bottom of the can and wasn't able to get much of a kick from it. I feel that is half my fault i was carrying it around with me everywhere and the temperature was changing a ton so now i am trying to keep it in a drier place and see how it does this go around. But over all if you keep this stuff safe it will do great works for you. i Highly recommend just trying it out for how great of a price it is.\n",
      "pump, energy, focus, endurance were all there. Best taste for any preworkout supplement i've tried. Kicks in quick and you can feel it working before even starting to lift. Used 1 scoop for about 3 weeks then bumped it up to 2. Better than jack3d in my opinion and you don't crash like you do with jacked. Will definetely use this again.\n",
      "C4 is amazing, if you havent try it you should! great product for the money!\n",
      "I read and watched a bunch of great reviews on this supplement and was actually pretty psyched to give it a try.. Unfortunately this **** sucks, no pump at all I have gone as far as 4 scoops pre workout and no pump at all.. Don't waste your money on this product.. Jack3d is so much better. However it did taste good\n",
      "I like this product more than jacked 3d...The price point is better, the taste is better, and the TINGLE is better....I mix with ASSAULT for a monster workout!\n",
      "One of my favorites and I use these alot.\n",
      "Great taste. Decent value. Very very effective! I like how they tell you the caffeine content and I could adjust with 1 or 2 scoops from that. One of the best pre workouts out today simple as that. Will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Great product .!!!Best preworkout supplement ever!!\n",
      "This stuff is amazing! Blows Jack3d out of the water!\n",
      "I must say, I just finished trying this product for 30 days and it's not what it's cracked up to be. The pre-workout pump is nothing compared to it's competitors. Unless that is, if you like scratching your face off because it feels like a million pins are in it. The only good thing about it is the NO does seem to give you that pump in your muscles, no energy though. Not worth it, seek a pre-workout elsewhere.\n",
      "Good preworkout supplement. I don't feel the jitters or overwhelmingly energetic. Helps me focus a little as well. To really feel it, i have to take at least 1.5 scoops of the stuff. Sometimes i have trouble sleeping at night after taking it during the afternoon. Overall good supplement.\n",
      "Great pre-workout, gives tons of energy and great pumps, make you want to stay in the gym longer, ill take this over jack3d any day. scooper is a little bigger then jack3d but mixes well, same taste as No xplode\n",
      "My intense workouts demand a good pre-workout supplement, so I read up on several products and compared them for hours. Finally. I concluded to go with C4 and Black Chrome. Let me start by saying up until this point I had been using EndoRush and was getting a nice pump and decent energy for my 2+ hours in the gym. I started the C4/Black chrome with slightly less than the recommended dose(2 caps and 3/4 scoop) to test it out first(highly recommended). The Intensity that followed was something out of an incredible hulk movie...I was starting to freak out a bit about 30min after taking it because I felt red and flushed. I checked myself in the mirrow and I wasnt red ...but I was dang sure was tingling all over. No joke..It felt like electricity was flowing in my muscles. Like electric shocks while my muscles were contracting. I was sweating hard after the first set...ears tingling and defintely amped up. [This product does not have Niacin but a MORE reactive intense version of it]. That crazy part lasted about 30min after which I had a very intense workout and was pumped even on muscles that I did not workout so yeah the pump was definitely there. The second time I did this product, I reduced the dose a bit to half scoop C4 and still took 2 caps of black chrome there was a huge difference...almost like I didnt take anything at all...I needed some EndoRush to get through my workout. I began slowing increasing my dosage but I am sad to say that I have yet to feel that intensity that I felt when I first tried this product. This may be a good thing because I felt like my hair was on fire. Ive using it for about 2 weeks now with what I think are deminshing returns and have had to use Endorush to get through my workouts severals times. I'll keep increasing the dosage but I almost scared. I did have some chest pains one time when using this product. (I have perfect blood pressure --no meds of any kind). I occassionaly supplement with CoQ10 and it could be an interaction with that so be aware...it was a bit scary but it only happened once and I now make sure not to take my CoQ10 anywhere near my workout time. One more thing, I noticed some viens in my upper chest and delts starting to pop out that I have never seen before...kinda freeky. Start slowly with this product. Get ripped...I am 39 year old. I am going to try a different pre-workout supplement next because of the rapid adjustment my body made to this product but I might be coming back... Good Luck.\n",
      "Took double the dose and still didn't feel anything or any of it's affects. 4 of my gym buddies gave high praise to this so I took it. I got nothing out of it. Taste is alright and that's about it.\n",
      "Excellent product, great taste and great pump. You can feel and see your body improving with every workout and notice how much more weight and reps you can complete after having the product. Only negative is after a couple weeks with it you start getting this &quot;tingling&quot; feeling on your skin but not a big deal. I actually kind of like it.\n",
      "Today I got my shipment of C4 accompanied by a bottle of NO3. I took them as recommended and hit the gym. I warm up with cardio every day and I was sweating maybe more than I ever have from the same workout. I usually stretch after, but I was too pumped to take the time; I had to hit the weights straight away. After about 30 minutes I literally had to stop for fear of throwing up from working so hard. This was the most intense workout I've had in months. I couldn't tell you if it was strictly the C4, or if it was the NO3, but combined they do wonders.\n",
      " Can't say that I notice all that great of a pump though, even after a hard workout.\n",
      "I was taking Jack3d for about 2 months but noticed It was losing it's kick after the first 5 weeks. I then decided to try C4. I love this stuff, taste is just amazing! they should make a soft drink out of this lol. Great pump, I have increased my workouts by 10-15lbs and I can keep going and going. Don't feel jittery or too crazy, I just feel the urge to workout but without any side effects. It also helps me recover from workouts. Great stuff!\n",
      "Great stuff, very similiar to Jack3d but you dont have to take as much and you get more for your money.\n",
      " Try D4 also, I'm using both ATM and I'm in the best shape of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great workout booster!! It is the first one I have tried but it works, and I love it! The taste is great and it doesn't make me really hyper but gives me endurance to workout for several hours! The only negative about this product is after several days I had to start taking two scoops before every workout; one just didn't do anything after a couple workouts. When you first start taking the supplement it also made me slightly itchy but the feeling passes. Overall great product!!\n",
      " I have to take a scoop above the recommended dosage to feel the effects compared to taking BSN N.O. Explode.\n",
      "This was my 2nd round of taking C4. This is by far the best pre-work out i have used based on the taste, intesity, and price. I can compare alot of the intesity to the same feeling i got from jacked, yet it tasted alot better and was even cheaper then Jack3d was. I love how it gets ride of the garbage i use to find in alot of the other pre-workouts (no-explode, na-no vapor, ect.) and just gives you want you need. I get great pumps from the stuff, and even take it for morning PT to help me wake up and get to most out of the early work outs.\n",
      "I have been using C4 extreme for one month now and i find i have more intensity in the gym. If you are looking for that tingly feeling that lets you know its there then this product is for you. But if you don't think it is working then stop using it for a week and then try again. I think you will see the difference.\n",
      "Great Product! I've used Jack3d, but this product has better effect and price. Gives you a great pump, gives you energy but not the jitters, doesn't have a bad crash like 1.M.R. (I still love 1.M.R. for max-out days) and finally you get a large amount for a very fair price. I would recommend for anyone who is looking for a cheap and effective pre-workout.\n",
      "This stuff is great. Ive been using Jack3d and 1MR for the past couple of months but this stuff takes it to another level. Great pumps, Great energy, and no crash! Try it once and youll feel the difference\n",
      "Great product i felt my face and ears burn when i first take it but overall i like the energy i get from it. Also have tried NO xplode, and jacked.\n",
      " I Stack this With Cellucor T7 Extreme and D4 Thermal Shock, I am nearly through my first 4-Week cycle with this and it has been working well for me for the past few weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never taken a PWO until today. I am 45 years old, male and weigh approximately 255 pounds. I took 1 scoop of the C4 at 9:05am and by 9:15am my forehead was sort of tingly. When I got to the gym and was ready to begin my workout, 20 minutes had passed since I took the dose. I felt something but nothing too weird. The energy was steady and constant throughout a one hour and fifteen minute workout. I did biceps and back today and was able to complete the session without feeling tired. So far today I have not had a crash and its been over about 5 hours since I took the dose. I wanted a PWO that didn't make me feel all cracked out and gave me enough energy to last the entire session.....C4 has done that. I bought the 60 serving fruit punch. It mixes very easily and tastes like Kool-Aid from when I was a kid. I will try one scoop for a week and then move to 2 scoops to see if the effects are worth the extra scoop. Overall....I am satisfied with the product. More to come after I take more doses and move through my entire weekly lifting schedule.\n",
      "Nice flavor, strong effect on me. Nevertheless, I found that I had to add the quantity I use so as to get the power I need in the work-out when my body had accustomed to it. All in all, it's really good, worth trying.\n",
      "Great product ive done No Xpload and jcked3d and plenty of other pre workout drinks. this one is the best im in mma and i don't get any bad bloat or anything just straight energy i can go 5 hard sparring rounds no prob now. Fruit punch taste isn't the best the orange rocks.\n",
      "Great stuff, Feels just like Jack3d, but the creatine is better. No bloating, and better for running as well.\n",
      "WOW! 10/10 coming off of jack3d I thought it wouldn't match up, but I was wrong. Best pump of my life! Also knocked PR out of the park today, if I could give this product an 11 I would. Awesome job Cellucor! Great value too!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a huge fan of bb.com, but there seems to be a trend when buying preworkouts from here... i purchased c4 after being off any preworkout for over 5 months so i expected the energy to be very intense; but there was none. I started one scoop, and had to take two the first time and the only feeling I got was a slight tingle from the beta alanine. product did absolutely nothing else\n",
      "Really good product! Gave me energy, good pump, I like the &quot;pins and needles&quot; feeling and this product gave me just enough to feel the burn and the itch. It wasn't overbearing to where it was uncomfortable. The taste was good, wasn't too sweet and went down smooth.\n",
      "This stuff always works for me! The taste is great, mixes perfectly, great pricing, and serving amount per container always nice. I'm now a Cellucor regular because of products like this! I did though get a tolerance to it but it was 2 weeks of using it non-stop. Highly recommend over all others!\n",
      "This pre-workout is no question the best I've had. I tried jack3d, assault and others but i just wouldn't feel it. With c4 it only takes one scoop and i feel it with in 10 minutes and it keeps me goin through my workout. I recommend this to anyone who wants a great pre-workout\n",
      "This product is a must buy, you will feel the effects and see the results 30 minutes later.\n",
      "I am a supplement company owner (Shocker Nutrition) and I just want to give credit where due. I don't want to take away from our pre-workout supplement sales so I must say ours are great and all... BUT Cellucor really got it right! I really enjoy C4. I noticed, like most pre-workouts, that it tastes better in cold water. The quality, the feeling, the endurance, the flavor, the packaging and most of all THE PRICE! Great product!! You keep making it, I will keep buying it. I get access to tons of free supplements, but I am happy to pay for this one!\n",
      "I started taking this preworkout because I was getting use to the Jack3d. The first time I took this I only used one scoop because I heard thats really all you need, but I guess because I was use to Jack3d, I got no pumps, or no tingle feeling. So the next day that I did arms I decided to take two scoops, and man did I feel a pump and the tingle feeling. It felt so crazy, it felt like I needed to scatch my whole body! Even more than Jack3d which I was surprise. It also give you more benefits than Jack3d, it give you cratine and also other things that will help your muscles to recover. I have been taking it now for like two weeks and my body doesn't seem to get use to it just yet (knock on wood). Highly Recommended!\n",
      "I LOVE Cellucor C4 orange. I have tried several other pre-workout drinks and none could i stand the taste of. This mixes so smooth and goes down smooth. You don't have to wait for it to kick in. It work almost immediately. It has everything in it to give you that Explosive workout you are looking for!\n",
      "I would have to say that C4 is similar to Jack3d but the pumps I get off of C4 are pretty good. My muscles look fuller when I work out with C4. The energy I get is not jittery, it's clean good energy. When ever I do take C4, I work out as much as my muscles will allow me. Taste isn't too bad. All in all, pretty decent product.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the best pre workout supplements out there. You can feel it working. It really maximizes your performance. I used it for a full week Then the following week I used it on Monday but not Tuesday, and I felt such a difference. I haven't worked out without it since then. If you are considering buying it, stop considering and buy it. I have Fruit Punch and the only thing I wouldn't give a 10 is the taste. It isn't bad where it is hard to drink just not my favorite, but I guess that is just preference. It may even bother you mouth a bit at the beginning, but if that is the case then just add more water. Also be sure to drink lots of water during your workout.\n",
      "I personally love the C4 Extreme. A lot of people that I know like Jack3d but Jack3d makes me feel &quot;cracked out&quot; for hours after the gym and the C4 Extreme doesn't. In my opinion C4 Extreme is by far better than Jack3d. The orange flavor is pretty decent too, none of these taste like Coors Light but the Orange flavor is decent enough that you dont have to worry about gagging on it. Given the choice I will always choose C4 Extreme.\n",
      "taste is pretty good but freaking sour. gives a good pump with two scoops. i'd recommend it. but not as good as everyone says.\n",
      "I have used C4 for about a month, and compared to NO-explode, I have seen more stamina in my workouts but a little less pump. The increased stamina has allowed me to reduce my body fat and add extra excercises to my daily workouts. The fruit punch was surprisingly tasty and the added caffiene gives me that extra push I need. Also it does not need to be taken on an empty stomach and taste better with less water mixture.\n",
      "This is by far the best pre-workout I have ever used!! It gives me that extra oomph I need... almost like having a spotter. I don't care else you've used in the past... you have to use this one! You won't regret it...\n",
      "All the standard pre workouts are all jacked up with caffeine and a ton of stims. I was looking for something that was low stims and still packed a punch, this was it. It kicks in in about 5-10 mins for me and the beta alanine feeling is awesome. I only take PWO's when i need to get through a plateau and C4 definatley helped. the energy is there but not overpowering, and the creatine is nice for the strength gains and extra push. Overall great product and worth trying for the price!\n",
      "This is one of the most intense pre-workout supps that i have taken. I take two scoops and about after 5 minutes of taking it i can feel my body warming up. When i get to the gym i feel ready to take on the world. I have moved up in strength and definition. I will never workout without it again!!! Great stuff!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a big Fruit Punch fan (THANKS TO THE ORIGINAL SUPERPUMP)\n",
      "I ordered this product just to see if it lived up to its expectations and it did. Even though I prefer superpump250, I would definatly recommend trying it. It tastes great (like koolaid), dissolves almost instantly, and has a strong smell of awesomeness. Plus the tub looks like you have explosives on the shelf. Also it doesn't give you the cracked out jitters like others I have tried or the dumps. However the only downside I experienced was that the first few times I used it my skin felt an irritated minor burn all over but that might just be me. Overall great product and it's cheap. Try it out! You won't be dissapointed.\n",
      "I bought this product as a recommendation from a friend and must say, it really works! The first time I tried it, I could not seem to tire out from my workout. I was energized and was able to do more reps than usual. I am hooked now and will keep using it. I can already see the muscle gains in a short period of time that I have been using the C4 Extreme. By the way, it taste good to so it is easy to drink! Try it, you will truly be impressed!\n",
      "Did not regret buying this at all. I am a huge jack3d fan and have been trying to find something better even though it’s considered the best. I think I found something that has met my expectations. I can’t say that it’s better than jack3d, but it’s very close to it. From the first workout C4 has not let me down. I’ve been taking two full scoops 20 minutes before workout. Mixability and taste are perfect. Man, the feeling isn’t all cracked out and you can sleep at night, but you just have pure focused powerful energy. You can work out for hours and hours and still be able to sleep at night. I workout in the evenings and I’m sensitive to stimulants so I wanted something that can give me the boost after work, but not keep me up at night. This product does just that. I have full energy and after my workout I drink my shake, come home and eat a lot of protein. I will say that I've taken Jack3d after taking C4 just to see if C4 is what I said it is and my strength and energy were higher on Jack3d. So overall, this product comes close to Jack3d, but nothing is better than Jack3d IMO. C4 is still a great product, but it's just not Jack3d. I've taken every pre-workout on the market and still haven't found anything better than Jack3d.\n",
      "Cellucor has done it again, but this time it is affordable to the masses!! C4 is the best of both worlds, In a world were you can stack M5 and N-Zero, this is the next best thing. Taste is great, result blow jackd out of the water..........and the rest don't come close. I will now be using C4 for 8 weeks, then N-Zero for 4 weeks, this will be my 12 week cycle(along with P6, and Iso Pro.......results are worth any cost.\n",
      "C4 is intense!\n",
      " Great product and tastes great!\n",
      " The taste isn't as good as its competitors, but it's not unbearable.\n",
      "Great product love it. I get great workouts with it. however, i get extremely hot and itchy. BUT its worth it\n",
      "Just finished my first workout with this product. Today was my back day and I blasted through my workout in under an hour (six exercises, 4 sets each, ten reps for each set). Awesome pump from this stuff, I only had one scoop and I would say that I liked just one scoop of C4 better than 3 scoops of Jack3d. Tomorrow is chest and I am going to try 2 scoops. I will review this stuff again once I finish it. Tastes like kool aid.\n",
      "Good stuff! Clean energy with a good amount of focus to get the job done. Pumps are solid as well. Endless endurance as well. No crash no Jitters. Great Job Cellucor!\n",
      "This is my favorite pre workout! I have tried Jack3d in the past because its supposed to be one of the best...C4 is DEFINITELY way better then Jack3d. Perfect amount of energy and a great pump!\n",
      "The energy which this product gives you is pretty intense, the pump is even better, I use this on my heavy days because I know I'll be able to get through the entire workout and make new gains EVERY SINGLE TIME! probably my favorite pre workout so far, better than NO XPLODE, M5, JACK3D, WHITE FLOOD, SUPERPUMP 250! only problem would be the taste, but then again its so concentrated and you need such little water to mix it that its more like a shot than anything else so nbd!!\n",
      "Excellent product, good energy and pump, steady and last throughout workout without jitters or crash.\n",
      "Great taste, Great Pump, Great Energy with no crash.\n",
      "Best pre workout drink I have ever tried!! Safe to say best stuff on Earth...sorry snapple.\n",
      " The fruit punch flavor is good tasting as well.\n",
      "I usually take jakk3d but i seen this new product and thought it was worth a try an d it was. it gave me a great pump and boost\n",
      "From someone who absolutely loved Jack3d, C4 is just that much better. I was hesitant to switch from Jack3d after such great results but am so happy I did. C4 gives great pumps and concentration and the results just keep coming. Highly recommend.\n",
      " Seriously I sound like a cheerleader but this is 100% honest. See for yourself.\n",
      "Best pre-workout, gave me the focus I needed, and the rush is amazing. Highly recommend this product!!!\n",
      "Solid pre workout. They obviously tried to copy jack3d and did a great job. It's just as good as jack3d, if not a little better product.\n",
      "I have only been using this product for a couple days now and I love it. The first day I tried it and I only did one scoop and didn't feel it that much I didn't feel any tingles from the Beta alanine but did get a bit more energy and had a pretty decent workout. The next day I tried a scoop and a half and felt the tingles and had a amazing workout it was my arm day and I didn't even get close to tired,my focus was amazing. I don't think I will go over a scoop and a half as for me it is the perfect amount and all I need to have a nice workout. Oh and also there is no crash from this product at all,when I tried Jack3d I did get a crash off it about 40 mins after my workout but not at all with this stuff.\n",
      "Fantastic product. Never had the chance to try cellucor's products because they are so expensive so I was surprised by the price of this stuff. This stuff seriously blows jacked out of the water ( which is useless junk anyway ), the pumps were amazing and the endurance lasts he entire workout. No crash either was experienced. Flavor is very good, like assault if they made a fruit punch flavor. Mix ability was great too, no clumps. I do circuit training so I need something that gives me tons of energy especially after a long day. I may even use this as a study aid because of the focus is incredible. So to sum it up....get this product.\n",
      "Cellucor is legit. They've always produced industry leading products, which in turn shows industry leading results. C4 tastes amazing, no gritty tastes, no nasty after taste, and no bloating. Focus, energy, power, and performance.\n",
      " Got great pumps, tastes great, and helps you get that last rep.\n",
      "I LOVE this product!! I got the first go around before it hit the stores, and it has sent my workouts to a whole new level!! Energy sores with this product!!! The taste is fantastic!!\n",
      "I've been using 2 scoops most days and 2.5 scoops on super-intense days. The pumps are insane and the energy is great. The taste is one of the best out there.\n",
      "This product taste great and give me the boost I need to finish my workout strong.\n",
      "I drank this for nearly 8-months I guess, on and off training days as a post-workout.\n",
      "This powder mixes well, the blue raspberry taste is amazing! Mixed with water and well developed flavor in coconut water.\n",
      "It does make you use the bathroom often than usual, it's a good process of cleansing with the fiber, I think. Helped me eat more, which I need to do for my goal in gaining weight.\n",
      "Gives great boost of energy and alertness with the caffeine, I happen to have a crashing effect or get drowsy easily with consuming caffeine but this powder was okay kept me busy to be more active throughout the day instead of being lazy and drop on the couch/bed.\n",
      "This is a pretty good product, I think it can be used even if you aren't trying to gain mass as long as you count your calories and account for the carbs in it. It can really be beneficial if you don't get a chance to eat prior to your workout, or if you're like me and would like to take in calories before a workout but cant because it makes you really sluggish. I wanted to test this out and made sure to get my last meal in about 4 hours before working out on a day I planned heavy deadlifts along with legs, normally when I do this I feel a really big glycogen drain after about the first 30 min, but with this I did not feel that same drain and did not feel sluggish at all, also it was surprising to me that the kick from the caffeine was still good enough, not super stim heavy but good enough, \n",
      "\n",
      "Good muscle building pre workout that I'd recommend depending on what your eating habits are prior to a workout. Having said all that it is loaded with fiber and as others have mentioned you will need to visit the bathroom afterwards, nothing earth shattering and wont prevent me from using it again but just keep that in mind.\n",
      " \n",
      "This is a product which I had actually purchased :D With that said, it's a pretty awesome product because it's C4 (which I already like) + a good dose of carbs and creatine (and I love my carbs). I've been using it on longer training sessions as well as my go to preworkout for when I go indoor rock climbing. Flavouring is of course on point as per usual with Cellucor products.\n",
      "C4 Mass is probably my new favorite thing EVER. I am currently in the process of doing my first bulk so I'm a little nervous but excited about any and all products that will help with it. I absolutely LOVE this product. I ordered the Icy Blue Razz and the taste is phenomenal. The formula truly is something else. The addition of carbohydrates allows for better endurance. I especially like this when I lift in the mornings on a fairly empty stomach because it gives me steady endurance along with the energy it provides. The pump I see from this product is insane! 100/10 on every aspect of this product!\n",
      "I have been a loyal cellucor user from day one. After receiving this product i had no doubt in my mind that this wouldnt work. Im usually a little deprieved of fiber and the fiber in this is exactly what i need. 2 scoops of c4 mass will have you blowing through your workouts and then sum!! The tingling sensation is there and i have grown to love that feeling. Only downfall of this product is the mixablity of this isnt that great compared to the normal c4 but the flavor is there and to me, Cellucor cannot be beaten on that! Overall i suggest this product to anybody wanting to put on that mass, you will not be dissapointed. Thank you Cellucor for making another great product and helping me achieve my goals!\n",
      "C4 Mass is not your run of the mill pre-workout, and that's one of the reasons that I really like it. Some users may not know this, but the addition of carbohydrates into the product helps with endurance and is perfect for those in a caloric surplus (bulking). I could not be more happy with my purchase, because it's just what I needed : a 2-in-1 product. What I mean by this is that you can use it pre-workout as well as intra-workout due to the benefit of the carbohydrates. Studies show that the use of carbs during a workout can be beneficial for athletes and strenuous activity. The product tastes great, just like any of Cellucor products. Mixability was also a non-issue. Overall, this is a solid product and I highly recommend it!\n",
      "When I first tried this pre workout I was a bit hesitant because I did not think that the carbs/fiber intake would make that much of a difference. After I took this pre workout (2 scoops) which is ALOT of carbs, I realized that I got the craziest pump of my life. I have never felt so vascular in my life and FULL. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get a new pump feeling and also to people who are bulking!Definently go try this! The flavor was awesome I love blue razz, cellucor always seems to nail the flavor and there was no clumping!\n",
      "As compared to C4 is doesn't mix very well, as well as the focus, and energy levels are inferior to regular C4 as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regular C4 gave me more energy and was able to lift heavier weight. \n",
      "\n",
      "This has honestly been one of my favorite pre-workout supplements. I'm not the type of guy that takes pre-workout for the numb face and gitters, so this pre-workout has been perfect. I have been taking one scoop of C4 Mass with one scoop of Creature creatine together as my pre-workout drink. The taste is as good as you can ask for! Nothing to complain about. Only negative side effects I notice are when I take it on an empty stomach. It just kinda makes me feel weird then. Otherwise great prodcuct! Got two additional tubs for my buddies. \n",
      "👍👍👍\n",
      "I feel like this doesn't give me near as much energy as the regular C4, but I like the fact that it has carbohydrates since my main concern is gaining mass. Tastes the same as the regular blue razz C4, just with a bigger scoop.\n",
      "I have tried many pre-workouts, this one has been interesting. Compared to both Optimums platinum pre and gold-standard pre, the taste is way better. Optimum likes to make bitter and sour pre-workouts, don't know why. In terms of energy and pump, you can't go wrong with C4. I get a killer pump from this pre, but it doesn't have me going as hard as I would like from the caffiene. The extra carbs are great for those trying to bulk up a little bit. I take this pre workout and use BCAA optimum for intra and follow up with the pro-gainer shake. Overall, I love the taste and the carbs, could use a little bit more beta-allenine and caffeine per scoop! \n",
      "Effectiveness... not impressed ! Wouldn't recommend. \n",
      "I've been trying this product for about a week now and what I like the most about it is the pump that you get. And we don't even have to talk about the energy because we all know C4 is the best when it comes to that. All the carbs that are in it help you get through those hard work days. I really recommend this product. I want to thank Dynomite Dustin for awesome customer service. Hope there's a sale soon so I can get more:)\n",
      "Body building rocks!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "So since I was taking a mass gainer and c4 I figured why not get c4 mass. Well I've never had regular ice blue razz so I can't tell you the diffrence in taste but it is a lot more to drink. With that said look at the fiber in this alone 44%!!! Which if you don't mind ******* and having to rush to the bathroom to poop right after a workout and multiple times a day and feeling gasy all day it's alright \n",
      "This product gives me the push I need to make it through my workouts and the flavor tastes close to watermelon, but has a hint of a medicine taste to it. \n",
      "Great boost during my active work day. Great taste also.\n",
      "I purchased the watermelon and Icy Blue Razz and the icy blue razz is much is stronger than the the watermelon. I drink the whole bottle of icy blue razz late aternoon and it give me energy  the whole night and I could not sleep; so, I tried drinking 5oz of the 10oz bottle and that was better for me. The watermelon doesn't have that affect on me. Both flavors taste good but it is better to experiment the Cellular C4 On The Go for yourself, in order to see how much you should drink for your results.\n",
      "I dont usually use these types of products but C4 on the go is very convenient and it has a great taste\n",
      "C4 On The Go worked just as well as the powder version.  The one major difference is the price.   If the price came down so that it made sense to buy C4 in this form I would definitely buy it for the convenience of just grabbing one and taking it without worrying about the hassle of mixing and not always getting the same dose.   \n",
      "I tried this both with and without a preworkout... the only thing I noticed is that it helped curb my appetite... sometimes.\n",
      "Like most, I stacked this product with Cellucor's Super HD.  Together, the two curbed my appetite pretty well. The major con of this product is that it's  pretty expensive and if you take as direct (3 capsules, twice daily), you'll run out of it in about 10 days. I'm not sure why so many say that this product is easy to swallow... I had a really tough time getting the huge capsules down and immediately after taking it it seemed like I would start burping raspberry.\n",
      "I love CLK! Much better appetite suppression than quadralean IMO. The raspberry flavor is really nice but pretty irrelevant to me since pills are on your tongue for all of two seconds. I am stacking this with Cellucor super hd and it maybe my imagination but I feel like my abs are already more visible, which is always a str****le for me without  perfect diet and tons of cardio. The only reason I don't give this product 10/10 is the cost. It is on the pricey side and the 90 count bottle is only a 15 day supply! FWIW this product has you taking more CLA than pretty much any other CLA-based product, so at approx. 0.54g CLA per pill you could try taking just 4/day and stretch it to a 22 day supply.\n",
      "Good Product to have in your arsenal when looking for optimal fat loss.  You won't notice like a stimulant but it's working. \n",
      "\n",
      "it helps when u stack with others\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoy taking this product; however, eating properly is a MUST. There are no ways to get healthy by spending money. On that note I add, these CLKs are slightly expensive, \n",
      "one of the best fat burner on the market\n",
      "The flavor was really great. I like that it is stimulant free. I dropped 6% of my body fat with this product in about 3 weeks!! which is great, because I am 12 weeks out...So it's crunch time, and this little baby definitely delivers. \n",
      "\n",
      "A bit pricey, but it works well ... and having to only have to take 1 pill vs 2-3 is an added bonus.\n",
      "I did notice that my stomach was flatter and my appetite was curbed pretty well while on this. However, it gives me the same results as any CLA formula I've taken, and those are much cheaper. I just got a 3 month supply of CLA for half as much as a one month supply as this. Does it work great? Absolutely. Worth the extra money? Not so much.\n",
      "I used this product along with Jym Shred and I love the results that I have gotten.  Within one month of using, I lost 8lbs and 3% bf so I'm def. going to continue and increase my cardio to lost 12lbs this month as a challenge to myself.  @ $2.00 per serving, CLK is a bit pricey but if results are your desire then it was very worth every bit of it.  The pills are large but drink it with your favorite juice and you should ok with it.  I would have rated this a product a 10/10 if it wasn't so pricey per serving but I gave it a 8/10 because I know they work!  \n",
      "Works good, but if your looking for faster results take super HD, but it did melt the fat around my waist and mid section, \n",
      "I noticed no difference from this product and lost nothing on a very clean diet. \n",
      "I had taken CLA in the past and it gave me a upset stomach. These did not. I would buy them again. \n",
      "I am preparing for a contest and don't want to lose my hard earned muscle while trying to lean out. I am taking 2 pills with a meal, 3 times a day and I have lost 1 lb of fat while gaining 3 lbs of muscle. Not stating that this caused me to gain muscle, just that it helps with the fat burning. No raspberry after taste as some may have. I am stacking with HD but at times take by itself.\n",
      "This is the first non-stimulant weight loss product I have tried. It was expensive and I'm not sure that it was worth it. The first two weeks taking 1 capsule 3 times a day seemed to help immensely with weight loss but after that it seemed to quit working. I've been on a strict diet and working out regularly.\n",
      "One capsule, 3x a day.  Saw positive results within 4 days.  After 4 weeks, big changes I can see and measure.  The difficult to shed fat around my middle is melting away.  My regular workout routine was not enough ... CLK has been a big help in taking care of the stubborn areas.  My goal has not been to lose weight, but to increase lean muscle mass.  I started out dropping a few pounds, but now I am gradually gaining the weight back ... as leaner muscle - without the unwanted fat \"baggage\".\n",
      "I started using this product today so I cant really say I have lost anything yet. I am combining the CLK with the Super HD and let me just say I have been house cleaning for eight hours only stopping a few times to eat. I have to make myself eat or remind myself to eat. it controls my appetite and gives me energy, I will update my review once I have been taking for awhile. I purchased two bottles of the CLK and two packets of the super HD.  \n",
      "Good taste, works amazing with stacking super. I had already been taking the super hd, added the clk and results have gone through the roof. A must have if your trying to cut weight or stuck at a certain number on the scale!\n",
      "I took this with Super HD Cellucor, fantastic results, highly recommended. Even without the HD it's a great stim free product!\n",
      "very goooood\n",
      "So far so great with this product.  NO weird feelings, or anything and it WORKS!\n",
      "\n",
      "Try it, you will  like it.  :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This product makes you hot temperature wise no weight loss. would not recommend\n",
      "Added CLK to my current cutting efforts (GNC Amped Ripped Vita Pak with CLA, Thermo, and Water Pill). I was already making good progress with clean eating alone, but I found CLK helped to expedite the progress even more. An important thing to keep in mind is that CLK, even when stacked wither Super HD, WILL NOT override a bad diet -- I think CLK works with a good diet, but if you eat crap, you're going to get crap results.\n",
      "Good results so far. It doesn't override a bad diet. Eating right is my biggest hurdle. This product really helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "working for me but its action is weak .\n",
      "great product but slow action .\n",
      "\n",
      " I am recommending it .\n",
      "Good stuff just started a week ago. Will give a more thorough review in a few weeks. I notice no raspberry burbs or anything like that. I notice that I'm not that hungry after taking the pills\n",
      "It did not work for me at all. I returned it. \n",
      "I am currently taking with with OxyElite Pro.  I am seeing great results when it come to fat loss.  I take this before workouts and I just feel awesome and I Definitely sweat more.\n",
      "I stacked it with cellucor super HD and Cellucor NO3 Chrome i've seen good results with propper diet i lost about 6KGs and gain 2 KGs of muscle .\n",
      "I have been taking this product for almost a week and already down 4.5% body fat according to my scale.  I will update again after 4 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was lucky enough to get to try this product for free thanks to the people at cellucor and boy was i shocked by the results of this natural fat burner. There are ZERO stimulants in this, so no accelerated heart rate, no increase in body temp, just added fat burning action! i took this on my cut and i went from 174lbs down to 150lbs in just 5 weeks! I definitely recommend that you give it a try! A great value for the price and stacks perfectly with super HD!\n",
      "Tried this along with Bodybuilding.com CLA, 90 Softgels.  Would recommend the BB CLA over this product.  Found the Cellucor produced more digestive issues and results were not as noticable.\n",
      "I am usually a big cellucor fan, however this product dd nothing for me. You have to take a lot of pills and it isn't a cheap sup. Save your money!\n",
      " Thank GOD Cellucor brought this product to the market.\n",
      "The fruit punch is my favorite by far w lemon lime in second. Fruit punch has a less chemical taste and doesn't leave me 'thirsty' like the lemon lime. Both are great as intra work out drinks and always keep them on hand - training and non training days. Been in my stack for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought this product to add in to my supplement regimen. I tend to use it more on weight days and save the alpha aminos for cardio based days. Taste is pretty good, tho I'm not a big fan of having a sweet drink if I take it intra workout. Ease of use, helps with recovery. Def recommend it\n",
      "Best stuff ever. Makes me feel so refreshed during and after a workout. Even on non-training days, I have started to crave it and the way it makes me feel so revitalized. The watermelon flavor is totally amazing\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, these are my favorite aminos I have taken. I took 2 scoops at LA Fitness the first started back going then switched to scivation because it's cheaper now back to this! I love the 3:1:1 ratio. of aminos and soreness is at a minimum after an intense session. Highly recommend this product\n",
      "I would like to Know what happened with CITRULLINE and HICA?  Ohhh guys you are selling a product different from the Ad. It used to have those ingredients in there, and when i recently bought 3 bottle of this, when i first took a look i knew it that was missing something in the bottle label. It's not the same product that used to be. I was cheated, and won't buy again any cellucor product.\n",
      "Great product! My workout is pretty intense and using this product made it seem a whole lot easier. I'd highly recommend it! \n",
      "\n",
      "Works great as a pre-workout boost with reduced recovery between sets (with no stimulants) or as post-workout recovery.  I've been using it 3-4 times per week for at least 4 months and am rarely sore after my lifting days (I still feel \"worked\", just not sore).  Fantastic product that I intend to work with long-term.\n",
      "The best BCAA I've ever used. It helps me power through workouts. I can definitely tell the difference when I don't have it with me. I use during and after workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "this tastes just like the pineapple gummy bears haha amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried this product for the first time a couple weeks ago and I was very impressed.  The formula is great, and is such that I use the product as a pre workout for when I am working out later in the day and I don't want caffeine.  They other thing I like is that the label actually shows you whats in the product rather than just having proprietary blends.  I only gave this product an 8/10 on flavor, but that is just my personal preference.  \n",
      "The product was simply amazing, felt a burst of energy but needed to wait at least 5 mins after consuming the product that I got to notice how much energy I suddenly got. My results with this product has defiantly helped me from fatigue and just giving it my all. Only thing I would change is if the container could carry more servings \n",
      "Amazing product. No tingly sensation during workout and keeps your energy levels up so you dont crash during a WOD. Im sold on it. Good job Cellucor\n",
      "Great product!! I can definitely feel a huge difference when taking BCAA's vs. when I'm not. The flavors are really good and the price isn't so bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most advanced intra-workout formula, and tastes awesome.Simply the best i used so far!\n",
      "Love this stuff!! Have tried several samples of BCAA powders, & this is def my favorite. It makes me feel energized & hydrated. It mixes easily, no grit, no aftertaste. I only tried the Watermelon flavor, & I like it a lot (tastes like watermelon), no chemical taste, but is a little sweet, so I just add more water than what is recommended. That's the only thing I take a point off for. It does give you a tingle, so if that freaks you out, don't buy this brand. I'm 130lb female, & I don't usually use a full scoop, I use a little more than half now. When I first started using it I only used a 1/2 scoop & it still worked great. Still haven't used a full scoop yet, but there are days that I drink this a couple times during the day. \n",
      "Very impressed with the watermelon flavor. It's exactly like the watermelon C4, so you can mix the two together before your workout and not have weird flavor stuff going on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lemon-Lime is good if you like a little sour flavor, but not as tasty as watermelon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good tasting product. Does foam a lot when mixing. Would purchase again down the road.\n",
      "I've used the Cellucor Beta BCAA for a while and I absolutely love it; it's a staple in my stack. However the last order I received was pretty abnormal. I've had both the watermelon and lemon lime before (both are great), & I ordered lemon lime again. But the taste was so gross - it tasted like cardboard with a little lemon aftertaste, absolutely nothing like how it regularly tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke to BB.com customer service and they were fantastic about a product exchange. However, when I received the replacement tub, that TOO had the off-taste.I never heard back from CS about whether Cellucor was messing with the product after the 2nd tub arrived like that but I'm currently stuck with a tub of cardboard BCAAs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my #1 overall supplement. Great Quality! Mixes easy! Tastes Fantastic!\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love the BCAA product that Cellucor makes.  When I first sampled this product at Mr. Olympia in Las Vegas I felt like I was drinking liquid Jolly Ranchers.  As far as the content is concerned, the label says it all, and you get exactly what you pay for.  These BCAA's are amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff taste amazing just like a margarita \n",
      "Best tasting BCAAs I've had to date! Started incorporating them this off-season and now I'm wishing I had used them during prep. Endurance has increased as well as recovery time.\n",
      "Watermelon tastes great!  Rarely sore after heavy lifts!  Love love love cellucor products!!!\n",
      "flavor is very good mixes very clean. doesnt upset my stomach at all which is good. i love that it has l citruline in it keeps me pumped during my workout. overall great profile for this bcaa i think this will be my choice of bcaa for along time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really like this product. It has a really nice blend. tastes great and works. It doesnt hurt that cellucor has pretty nice packaging. Only things that brought it down to a nine are no glutamine(which i think is a nice added bonus in bcaa formula), the aminos arent pharmaceutical grade and the price is a little high. Still, really good stuff overall and if you buy the stack its not a bad deal at all.\n",
      "while I think cellucor can be a bit pricey, when this is on sale it's a must buy. Flavor is awesome, profile is solid... def a good pick up when they've got their buy 2 get 1 deal going on or similar \n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the better BCAA powders that I have tried, and it sure beats taking more supplement pills.  I usually take it post workout and have noticed a huge difference in muscle recovery.  The only negative at the moment is that it I really have to stir it vigorously or the powder doesn't mix completely.  Iâm looking forward to trying other flavors as the fruit punch is just ok.\n",
      "Lemon lime and watermelon taste great!  Tropical punch reminds me of a rum punch and not in a good way, I can't drink it.\n",
      "This is my go-to BCAA powder!  Delivers just as advertised.  Cellucor always delivers with its products but their COR-Performance Beta-BCAA is definitely their best product.   I consume post workout and day after mainly, if you're sore and have eaten - drink this.  You can basically feel your DOMS go away and your muscle heal.   I live for the tingle sensation when I drink this post-workout, lets me know I worked the right muscle groups ;).   I drink it regularly, my 225 12% BF boyfriend does as well - no comparison and no other BCAA has delivered like Cellucor. My expectations are sincerely met with this product and I recommend for any serious bodybuilder/lifter who understands the fundamentals and true benefits of BCAAs (THIS IS NOT SUGAR WATER!)\n",
      "I feel in love with Cellucor brand a while ago and decided to give their BCAA product a try. Wow! This does exactly what it says it will and I love it. I don't think I'll ever buy from another brand because this works just perfectly. Flavor is amazing, ingredients list is even better. I recommend this to everybody I know and so far not one has had anything negative to say.\n",
      "These taste amazing and aid in recovery! 2-4-1! I sip on these throughout the day and sometimes when I'm on a really low carb nutrition plan I will use them to fill the game between my meals. Taste like Kool-Aid that's good for you! I love Tropical Punch but haven't tried the other two flavors because it is SO GOOD.\n",
      "I think this is a great product. Mixes easily with little residue, the flavour is very strong - it says to mix with 6-8 oz and I usually mix with 16-20oz just so I can make it last and the flavour is still very strong! Watermelon is delicious. BCAAs aid muscle recovery and I believe that it does help me feel less sore after a workout and I love the tingly feeling it gives :) I usually take it after a workout or during, helps keep me going. A little pricey compared to unflavored BCAAs but I think it's worth it just because it tastes so good!\n",
      "This review is strictly based on the flavor as I could only handle the one serving the one time.  I got the watermelon sample and it has that really thick, sweet taste...like getting iced and having to chug a smirnoff.\n",
      "Lemon Lime is SO GOOD!  WAY better than the watermelon one! But to me, all watermelon flavors always have that same fake generic taste to me.  But this lemon lime tastes like really good fresh lemonade! I practice IF so I really rely on BCAAs, this one is a keeper!:)\n",
      "Great ingredient profile for a BCAA.  The beta-alanine and HICA are great additions to an already high quality product.  Appreciate the breakdown on the label rather than just a proprietary blend as is with many out there.  Taste is great, I mix 1 scoop in 1 liter of water and that seems to dilute it enough that its not overpowering.  That said, my only issue is the cost per serving in comparison with other BCAAs out there.\n",
      "I  think I would only buy this product again if it were on sale\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantastic, just so you know I gave it an 8 for flavor only wanted to try something different but the product itself definitely gets a big fat 10\n",
      "Very good! U feel the BA working and I'm sure the HICA dose helps. Tastes good and awesome intra workout. \n",
      "I had only tried one other BCAA product before trying Cor-BCAA and first let me say I didn't know what I was missing. The profile is very solid with the addition of Citrulline Malate, Beta Alanine and HICA. The flavor is great as Cellucor products never disapoint in this area. The watermelon is pretty strong but just have to add more water to get it to the taste you want. What I noticed most with using this product is I am very seldom sore the next day after a training session. Before using this product I would always have DOMS the next day regardless of what I used. I used this product mainly because I train in the mornings at a fasted state. This is a great BCAA product and would highly reccommend to someone on an extreme cut or training at a fasted state.\n",
      "Would've rated higher but it's a bit pricey - best to nab it on sale. Watermelon flavour was disappointing but the others are good. Love what's in it regardless - make it a bit cheaper and it's a winner!\n",
      "This is by far my favorite BCAA, i always take complete advantage when they offer deals on it. Ive only had lemon lime but have had 6 different cans of it, taste amazing. Also love the research and verification cellucor puts into their products, unrivaled.\n",
      "This is the Best BCAA I have tried to date. I take 2 scoops  during my workout. it helps me push through my workout where I  am now beating personal records. At least one per workout. I stack this with C4 for the most amazing workouts.You can have 2 during workout or use one scoop before then the 2nd scoop after. The Beta Alanine helps.  Lemon-Lime is great when mixed with about 10oz of water or a Powerade.\n",
      " Downside is if you use 2 scoops it will last 15  workout sessions.The product is pricey but you get what you pay for.  I took advantage of a deal that was on an invoice  from a previous order for 50% off.  Take advantage of current deal (buy 2 get one free) \n",
      "I've come to love this product, and have tried all 3 flavors. The watermelon taste really watered down, but Lemon and punch taste amazing.\n",
      "I use this with C4 and had some great workouts\n",
      "Awesome BCAA supplement! It gives you the great benefits from beta alanine and I saw an amazing increase in my endurance throughout my cardio and weightlifting workouts. Mixes extremely well and taste like lemonade! Definitely will purchase again. \n",
      "To start, this product tastes great! This is the first great tasting BCAA product that I have tried. I have tried a few samples of other BCAA products and they did not taste good at all. This product wakes me up on those down days as well. It gives me clean energy. This product also has a solid profile. Not too many companies have the exact amount of ingredients on the nutritional label, just proprietary blends.  Last but not least the packaging looks very cool and professional. The only downside to this product is that it is kind of expensive compared to others. $1.39 per serving is a bit much for my budget. I got this with a 50% off coupon so that is the only reason why I purchased it. Great product otherwise!\n",
      "This is a very good product, order the for the third time (fruit punch like most others). It helps to focus on training, provides a burst of energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried several BCAA products in the past.  This product is by far the best I've ever used.  First, it taste great.  If it wasn't a BCAA product, I'd drink it regularly when thirsty and enjoy it with meals.  It's that good.  As for performance, I've made a practice of using it during my workouts.  Especially during my heavy workouts, I've experienced added endurance.  This has helped me complete these workouts with far less exhaustion and less soreness afterward.  In conclusion, I WILL continue to use this product going forward.\n",
      "first of all, it tasted amazing... i take my bcaa's intra workout, and the lemon- lime was super refreshing... results were pretty much as expected... i didnt really feel the beta alenine though... over all it was a pretty good product.\n",
      "I love the taste of this i mix it straight in with my Jacked3d and it works wonders amazing pump and the tingling sensation is defintely present in this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucor tends to have great sup profiles, and This stuff is no exception. I use their zma too. The beta alanine kinda surprised me because I took it not knowing it was in there until i checked he label when I got back home. The taste is like no other fruit punch iv ever had and it great. Has that extra pineapple/ piÃ±a colada taste, which is pretty fancy. I haven't used it long enough to really notice too many differences, but from what I understand, it's difficult to really notice bcaa products affecting you anyways. I used a cupon, and that the only reason I bought this stuff cause its pretty expensive. Cupon is \"50percpbb\" if you want to try it 20.00 bucks off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good product but too expensive\n",
      "I believe that this product actually did enhance my performance and recovery! GREAT ratios and ingredients. The watermelon flavor is definitely the best! My favorite watermelon Ive had yet. Tropical punch is unique and one of a kind, and the lemon-lime isn't bad either! Worth a try if you have the extra funds\n",
      "Flavour of Lemon-Lime was great, I only use one serving during my workout so the price isn't too bad. Feel a good pump with this product and consistent energy. Strength during workout is there and it takes much longer to fatigue. Definitely reccomend, will definitely buy again. \n",
      "Tropical Punch\n",
      "One of my favorite post workout supplements, I take it right after my workouts. Mixes well and taste great.\n",
      "Great great bcaa powder! The HICA and beta alanine really makes a difference to the competition, although it is a little overpriced.\n",
      "Best intra workout on the market. Tastes amazing. I had both lemon lime and tropical punch flavors. Both tasted fantastic. A bit pricey but it works so well, I really don't mind\n",
      "\n",
      "I just started this product and it taste so good and I know its working becasue Im not as sore as i used to be!\n",
      "take it during my workout its great helps me thtough\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " other than that i feel it worked but then again i felt water worked well also\n",
      "Taste is bad but tolerable. Where this product excels is on the ingredients part. Its got BCAA and on top of that is HICA (Leucine on steroids). Don't care about Citrulline and Alanine but those two being included is a bonus. It is expensive but you get what you pay for in most cases and this is one of them. It's not an expensive crappy product, but good quality expensive product.\n",
      "By its self it taste good, but i mix 2 scoops with 2 scoops of c4 watermelon and i just chug it with 10 ounces of water, gives a great pump, faster recovery, add weight to every set every week, thanks Cellucor for a great product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes awesome and has a great profile. stacks well with l-carnitine for a great caffeine free pre-work out.\n",
      "This product is very good! I liked it a lot better than Muscle Pharm's Amino! Took 1 scoop before my workout and was feeling really good! Increased energy and stamina. I did recover a lot faster, but I'm going to see what using two scoops will do. As far as taste goes, it's really strong. I use 25 ounces of water with one scoop just because it's so sweet!\n",
      "I use this both throughout the day for muscle recovery and coupled with a serving of C4 Extreme 15 minutes before my workout. I get amazing results with this dosage. Kudos to Cellucor for making an awesome BCAA product that's priced well.\n",
      "Got this product to try love this stuff works real good during and after your workouts give you what you need feel reel good and not run down after your workouts have used orthers like inner amour but the cellucor is ten time better .\n",
      "Taste is slightly metallic (hence the BCAA profile), but the Beta Alanine and HICA combination makes this incredibly effective for short HIIT workouts!!! Definitely recommend this product if you want a strong stimulant-free BCAA Intra-workout.\n",
      "watermelon tast great lemon-lime not so much takes some getting used to \n",
      "I just switched from Xtend to Cellucor's BCAA product. The Xtend is tasty, but the Cellucor BCAAs led to a greater pump, recovery, and overall feeling during my workouts. \n",
      "This is a great bcaa product! Awesome recovery...\n",
      "I have to say this is one the best stacked BCAA I have seen. I was able to try some of these in the sample form in each of the flavors. It mixes very well with very little or no grit and minimal agitation in the shaker. The flavor is one of the best tasting Tropical Punch flavors I have tried with almost no bitter after taste. Close to being like Kool-Ade! The composition and make up of the product are 2nd to none! I think the Beta-Alanine and Citrulline Malate are awesome and Citrulline provides a great pump. I am in the process of getting some more time with this product and will follow up again once I get more time using it. The week of using this product I didn't feel as sore after a tough leg workout and recovery was easy. Thanks Cellucor for getting this product to market with nicely stacked ingredients! So far, I'm hooked on using this product!\n",
      "Mixes great! tastes pretty good but does have a &quot;bite.&quot; Nothing terrible! Could definitely fill the tingle from the Beta Alinine. I used 2 scoops and drank it throughout my workout. The only negative would be that it has no glutamine and if you use 2 scoops to get the 3.2 grams of Beta you need, you only get 15 servings. Still better that USP labs BCAA's. I did heavy dead lifts which always kill my ability to walk the next day. I have very little soreness. I also used creatine after the workout.\n",
      "I was one of the lucky ones chosen to beta-test this product and WOW!  The taste is on point with each flavor!  I especially enjoyed the Tropical Punch(peach/mango flavoring).    Mixability is perfect, leaving no foaming or residue behind whatsoever.  I took this during a double-header and the endurance I had was unreal.  Really felt I got stronger/faster as games progressed.  This product, to me, would only be effective if 2 scoops were used, giving a 15 serving container for $30.  Not terrible, but would like to see larger serving sizes available.  I highly recommend this product for someone looking for the next big things in the BCAA market.  Cellucor once again did not disappoint with this product!\n",
      "Just started using this as part of my nutrition, no flavor noticed even when mix with water. Will probably buy again.\n",
      "The creatine does its job but does not mix well at all and settles at the bottom.\n",
      "Great value for a basic creatine. No flavor noticed even when I tried it in just a lil bit of water either. 1 tub is gonna last me like 4 months too! Will be buying again! \n",
      "Never had Creatine before and i bought Cellucor cause i used their products and have been excellent. \n",
      "Rated 10 of 10 cause is really unflavored and gets mixed very well, i'm taking one scoop with C4 prior to workout and with my Cor Performance Whey post workout and i can notice better endurance and increase of strength.    \n",
      "8/10. It did what creatine mono hydrate is suppose to do. It is unflavored and settles at the bottom and more expensive then other creatine mono hydrates. Other than that it's a solid product to give a try. \n",
      "It's unflavored, like all creatine is supposed to be. I went 9/10 only cause it does tend to settle at the bottom even after it's been shaken a lot. But, it's creatine. I'd honestly just recommend everyone take the BB.com creatine. More servings, less money. No issues with mixing. \n",
      "Mixes very well and gets you that extra mile. Very good product\n",
      "Not the best fish oil I have tried but for the price it's not that bad. The part that bothers me is that you have to take one with three meals a day. I would like it better if you could use it only twice a day. I hate caring it everywhere.\n",
      "Loveeee this protein! It mixes well in the shaker and is easy to bake with too. Peanut butter Marshmallow is the most amazing flavor in my opinion. The smores flavor is pretty yummy also and even has little bitty marshmallows. Molten chocolate is one of, if not the best choclate protein. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've only had the molten chocolate and chocolate peanut butter flavor and im not a huge fan to be honest. Excellent product delivering the best results when eating properly. Tastes insane, best whey i have tried. It id \"informed choice\" certified which is essential. Worth getting it for the extra money.\n",
      "I love this protein! It is made with quality ingredients and has never made me bloated. Cor-Whey has helped me to consistently build muscle for about 3 years now. I've tried other proteins when Ive had sample packets but I always come back to this one!\n",
      "Perhaps I've just been spoiled by Optimum Gold Standard but this tasted like the cheap protien powder we'd have in high school football.  Clumpy and chalky.  Even putting the powder side by side with Optimum there was a noticeable difference in how this stuff clumped up.  Has the old warm milk taste when mixed with cold milk.  It actually tastes better to me in water than milk.  I'm no protien doctor but this right away just struck me as the same exact crap cheap protien I used 8 years ago.  Perhaps it is just very basic protien, but it's going for the price of some fantastic powders I've tried.  Certainly will not be purchasing again.\n",
      "Great product.\n",
      "I got the Cinnamon Swirl which tastes awesome.  Amount of calories are good and a lot of protein!  Definitely buying more of this protein and flavor and going to try other flavors as well.  Get some now you're missing out!\n",
      "I like that this whey is low in calories and has a good amount of protein. I rated it low only because of taste.\n",
      "It does not taste like cookies and cream! I mixed it with a banana and unsweetened almond milk but it was still gross.\n",
      "Nutrition label shows a pretty decent product but the taste is not up to par. The chocolate peanut butter is slightly better than the molten chocolate but not by much. Both flavors have a weird aftertaste that I don't much care for. We bought each flavor in the 2 pound size and as much as I hate wasting money i doubt I'll be able to finish either flavor. For reference i've tried Animal Whey, Hydra 6, ON, Pro Jym, Muscle Pharm, and Syntha 6 and this is probably my least favorite brand.\n",
      "I really enjoy this protein, seems to be working well\n",
      "For me! Just wish the mint chocolate chip was sold\n",
      "In 4lb tubs.\n",
      "Just buy this already! So far the best that I've tried! Will be ordering more and in the bigger containers!!! I just ordered the 2lbs to try it out.... I love it!\n",
      "This is my second order from BodyBuilding.com and love their quick service from order to door.   I also appreciate how they give a magazine and a sample of another product in the box.  \n",
      "The first protein I ever tasted was the Whipped Vanilla.  It quickly was my favorite, but found the aftertaste something to get used to.  Not bad, but was not the most pleasant.  My favorite for flavor consistency per thickness is the Strawberry Milkshake.  Two thumbs up, I think it tastes like a decent milkshake.  \n",
      "The one that was not my favorite but still good was Chocolate Peanut Butter.  For me, I could never get over it tasting like drinking a liquefied Reese's.  Just never could get the flavor per thickness quite correct.  My recommendation is to add a bit more water than other protein powers may require.  It is quite the bold taste and I enjoyed this as a snack.  The Whipped Vanilla I usually had before bed.  \n",
      "Looking forward to the Chocolate Mint! \n",
      "Love the Cinnamon Swirl with some almond milk. Mmmm! The Molten Chocolate is also amazing! I tried the strawberry milkshake and its just not sweet enough for my taste so I usually add fresh or frozen strawberries to this when I drink it. \n",
      "I use Cor-Performance Whey for both my breakfast morning shakes and for pre- and post-workout shakes. I have been using it for a year and so far have been quite pleased with the taste and the results. \n",
      "This is the first whey that I've had from Cellucor so I can't give as much of a detailed review as I'd like, however, from what I can tell thus far it's done it's job. I always take my protein with water because of the fat content in milk and because it doesn't make me feel so full, but if you use this flavor with milk it would taste exactly like the left-over milk in cinnamon toast crunch; it's one of the better tasting proteins I've had. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd recommend at least getting the 2lb tub to give it a try. The flavor isn't overpowering either, which I like because I'm not a big fan of cinnamon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hope this helped,\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers\n",
      "Good clean whey.  I first bought Chocolate Peanut Butter, which is good, hard to mess that one up.  I also bought Whipped Vanilla which was good, but I am not huge on vanilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next to try was the Cinnamon Swirl which I love.  It pairs well with most fruits(try Avocado, frozen peaches or bananas for maximum flavor).  One of my favorite whey protein powder I have ever hard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good deal for buying two, I highly suggest this product. \n",
      "When I bought it I got the cor-fetti flavor. It tasted awful. Imagine chalky texture and crappy brand confetti cake mix...........that would've slightly tasted better than this flavor. I have had one other chocolate variation by Cellucor (I don't recall the exact flavor name, it was a sample from my trainer) and it wasn't horrible but it wasn't good either. Took one small taste and ended up just slamming the rest down in order not to waste the protein. Neither of them mixed well without a blender ball so I strongly suggest mixing well with a blender ball or blender to avoid the generic clumps issue. I personally wouldn't suggest this particular brand to someone. \n",
      "I love Peanut Butter Marshmallow. It is great with PB2 in a protein shake or in oatmeal. I wish Body Building had Cookie Dough as I want to try that flavor next or the Chocolate Peanut Butter. \n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl Cor-Whey is my all-time favorite protein! It tastes amazing, blends perfectly, and is a fantastic flavor for making protein goodies too. Definitely satisfied with the macros on the Cor-Whey. I drink this protein shake almost daily and it's been in my stack for the past two years! I never get tired of the flavor and it doesn't have the bad artificial tastes of others. I have tried a few other Cellucor flavors and my second favorite would be Peanut Butter Marshmallow.\n",
      "Chocolate Peanut Butter - 10/10, I'm a HUGE fan of Cellucor's protein, specifically CPB, pure heaven!  This stuff is DELICIOUS.  Tastes like REESE'S Peanut Butter Cups in your mouth.  \n",
      "\n",
      "S'more - 10/10.  It had an AMAZING taste, plus had pieces of graham cracker in it.  Cellucor was retarded for discontinuing this, since this was the BEST protein ever.   Now, I use BPI's S'mores, which is almost as good as Cellucor's version. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl - 7/10, has a tart taste due to the artificial sweetener, but once you get past that, it does have a taste Cinnamon Toast Crunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peanut Butter Marshmallow - 8/10, has a tart taste due to the artificial sweetener, but still good, has a very rich peanut butter taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies N' Cream - 8/10, tastes good, has little bits of cookies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vanilla - 3/10, the tart taste is too extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Molten Chocolate - 6/10, very rich chocolate flavor, but had some tart taste to it, due to the artificial sweetener.\n",
      "\n",
      "Confetti Cake - 9/10.  This was YUMMY, plus had sprinkles in it, but again Cellucor discontinued it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Note: I drank all of these with water, just to give you context, I'm sure with milk, almond, or soy milk, it will tone down the artificial sweetener.\n",
      "Solid protein. It gets 9/10 simply because it's only 71% protein as opposed to other brands like Optimum Nutrition (77%), All Max (81%), and Isopure (82%) and is slightly higher carb. That isn't a huge difference nutritionally but when I'm buying 5lbs of protein it means Cellucor yields significantly fewer servings than the other three. Vanilla is pretty good... It's very sweet, though. Molten Chocolate tastes like chocolate milk to me. Cookies N' Cream... No. It's awful. It tastes weirdly coconut-y? I got it for the BOGO deal a while back and now I understand why they were trying to get rid of it; It tastes like garbage.\n",
      "I really do like this product! Great taste, high in protein, low in fats/carbs & also mixes pretty easily. I'm on 5th tub of Cellucor Whey. I've tried Cinnamon Swirl, Whipped Vanilla & now currently Molten Chocolate! All great flavors! I say MC is my favorite one thus far. Hard to beat this protein. Never had any issues with my stomach. This is a great protein for post workout or up your protein intake for the day.\n",
      "Amazing protein. Very well packaged and very well made. The flavors I have listed taste very good, however, in water alone, it has a thin feel to it and comparing it to Muscle Milk, I prefer the thickness and taste of the muscle milk more. However, this protein has yielded much better results for me over Muscle Milk!\n",
      "Excellent flavors but has the thickening agent that I did not like. Great protein for the money plus you can use this protein for baking.\n",
      "This is the best Whey protein I've had. The chocolate Peanut Butter tastes absolutely amazing and helps me recover pretty quickly even after a heavy workout. I make smoothies and also have it with an oatmeal breakfast too. I definitely recommend this.\n",
      "Been using this brand for the past 6 months now. Definitely made some gains. Chocolate peanut butter was good. Not too rich and dissolved well. Vanilla was okay. Didnt mix well and taste was average.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going to try the cinnamon swirl and something else next. Would definitely recommend this brand!\n",
      "OK finally tried chocolate, raspberry, it's good, thicker than the others. And tastes more like chocolate covered strawberry. Still good. Tried this one today! No stomach distension and was mixed half milk and half water, mixed perfectly tasted way better than i thought one of the best chocolate tasting wheys out there. So was hesitent on the peanut butter. And was pleasantly supprised. A sweet taste not peanut bitter. Ok tried the cinnamon today I mixed it with some plain oatmeal. Delicious! \n",
      "Decent Whey, but the Cinnamon Swirl got a little much going through a 4LB'er, Vanilla tasted good\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so I'm new to all of this, but I have tried multiple different protein powders and so far this is one of my favorites when pertaining to taste. The Chocolate Peanut Butter tastes glorious and it mixes very easily with a shaker. Furthermore, I can mix it with water and it still tastes awesome. I normally mix with light vanilla soy milk... Anyways, It's low calorie/carbs and has a solid dose of Protein. Whats not to love?? For the most part, this protein gets the job done with no grit and I definitely recommend.\n",
      "Love this protein! The cinnamon swirl taste is fantastic. It mixes super well too. \n",
      "\n",
      "I use this strictly post work out and it has really helped my recovery time and it will now be my go to from now on!\n",
      "Chocolate peanut butter is the best protein powder I have ever tasted by far. I'm gonna buy like 6 more right now\n",
      "Does not digest well at all. I experienced a lot of bloating and 'feeling heavy' after taking it. I wont continue to use this product.\n",
      "Absolutely horrible. I have had different whey proteins with the same flavor. I love chocolate peanut butter flavor but this one just didn't taste right. I did not like at all. I've only used it twice and I am looking for new protein.\n",
      "I am reviewing this product mainly on mix ability and taste. I only bought these when they were BOGO free. The Milton chocolate mixes excellent and tastes awesome . Really bold chocolate imo. The strawberry is awful tasting and gets really foamy when mixed with milk . The chocolate didn't do that so not sure why.\n",
      "I was given a 2 lb container to try recently.  I did not have high hopes for this one due to the fact that all other PB protein powders I've tried never really tasted much like PB.  However, Cellucor have got it dead on!  By far the best tasting PB protein I've tried and with the expected Cellucor quality.  Mixes well and tastes great in oatmeal.\n",
      "It mixes well but the taste is awful. It taste like cheap chocolate and is super sweet.\n",
      "This is a pretty decent protein flavor-wise, but the only downside is the small cookie things always settle to the bottom of the shake, and I end up having to clean them all out! However I would recommend this as it has good nutritional value and is a good flavor.\n",
      "Love all of their products \n",
      "way too sweet to be mixed with water.  I use it for baking oatmeal/banana cookies and its great.  I just cant drink it.  \n",
      "Im extreme picky when it comes to protein shakes as far as the way it taste but have fell in love with the flavor of cellucor molton chocolate. Not only does it taste great but it is also low in carbs and sugar. Love this product\n",
      "Always been a fan of CorWhey but the new PB Chocolate flavor is out of this world good! Already on my second tub ;) The cinnamon swirl is also incredible, very nice to see such a variety in tasty flavors A+ \n",
      "I primarily use protein to keep up with sweet cravings/hunger after workouts if I know I won't be able to get a full meal in immediately after. COR is good for it's price. I will speak about each flavor separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peanut Butter Marshmallow: Flavor is surprisingly good, in water, milk and food. Mostly a peanut butter with a hint of marshmallow. Mixes nicely in water and milk. Goes great in pancakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Molten Chocolate: A little bit heavier chocolate taste than most other proteins I've tried, which is a good thing. Tastes good in water, milk and food. Makes a great post workout/late night chocolate milk thanks to the taste. Mixes nicely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl: This was the oddball flavor. Tastes great in food (oatmeal, pancakes, etc.), just like adding cinnamon sugar to whatever you are eating. In water and milk, this has an odd chemical taste and does not mix as well as the other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was able to get 2 pounds of each during a buy 2 get 1 offer, and these were definitely worth the money. I recommend Molten Chocolate and Peanut Butter Marshmallow. I would only recommend Cinnamon Swirl if you are only using it for use with making protein foods.\n",
      "Whipped Vanilla powder with 16 oz of milk, half a banana, and some chocolate syrup in the morning is aaaaawesome.\n",
      "Cellucor had always made the best powders for protein in the market. The taste and texture of this particular flavor is a great tribute between chocolate and peanut butter, which is also best blended with a frozen banana, blueberries and almond milk for a meal replacement. I often drink this for post workout along with glutamine and creatine. I have increased my strength by 10% so far. I must say, 25g of protein is definitely a god send, along with unbeatable taste. Thanks Cellucor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall an excellent product for the price, profile, and taste. I had the Whipped Vanilla and it is a good and solid French Vanilla flavor, but it doesn't stand out taste wise compared to some other vanillas. I would definitely recommend this protein though, worth the money easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall- I like it, but more as a chocolate than chocolate peanut butter; I would say if you like YooHoo! And want a slight PB addition to that than this is a score. It mixes great, smells good, and the profile/price is fantastic as always. If you want a heavy peanut butter flavor in your protein though, than this wont be delivering that, it’s good but not quite there in the flavor description.\n",
      "Chocolate Peanut Butter - Amazing! Smooth, and creamy. You can use this flavor for all kinds of things and you wont miss out on the extra calories of \"Real\" Chocolate and peanut butter. I would have loved for it to be a little more peanut buttery, but I do like the flavoring and would recommend it. It blends very nice and there are no clumps.\n",
      "Not bad.  It's a bit lacking in flavor, but certainly not gross.  It mixes easily.  Solid protein mix here.\n",
      "I have this every morning with 8-10oz of fat free milk and two scoops of low-fat salted caramel ice cream (i have a bit of a sweet tooth;)) and it is amazing. mixes well, no clumps, and great tasting. would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great new protein.\n",
      "This is one of the best all around proteins on the market! The taste is great it mixes well and it's versital for cooking. You don't get bloated or gassy from it and all the Flavors are great. The new chocolate PB is a must try.\n",
      "Amazing protein, great taste, and even better, great results. I have definitely noticed how well I have put on muscle mass since using this protein. My only complaint is that it does NOT mix well if you stir in a cup with a spoon. The product claims to mix really well but I find that to be the opposite. I am use milk in a blender bottle and it mixes pretty well, there is still a few small pieces that don't mix in but that is kind of expected. \n",
      "10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend if they use a blender or blender bottle or don't mind the chunks that don't mix in (does not taste chalky one bit).\n",
      "I have been using this product on and off again for awhile and this is always the flavor I gravitate towards.  Tastes amazing, smells amazing and it mixes well in just about anything you want to do with it.  Love cooking with Cellucor protein as it bakes very well, especially as protein pancakes/waffles.  Using it as just a shake is very refreshing and does not leave your stomach empty feeling as some protein shakes do. All in all, this is likely my favorite protein powder to use and I find myself always reordering it so I at least have it on-hand.\n",
      "One of the best proteins but in my opinion the best, flavors are just great even if mixed with water on a hand shaker the consistent is perfect i usually add two scoops post workout and also as snack i add one scoop to a cup of plain Greek yogurt and gets mixed very well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The best protein I have ever had. The chocolate/peanut butter is AMAZING! I would recommend this to anyone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Flavors are definetly top Notch. Ive tried the PB Marshmallow and Chocolate raspeberry truffle and both are amazing.  There is nothing like the chocolate raspberry.  These proteins make awesome sludges and are equally great in shakes!  I like the low calories.  Cellucor is one of my favorite protein powders for sure.  The PB Marshmallow may be better than PES Select, its a judgement call, i did prefer cellucor to trutein however, which is a knock out in flavor for PB\n",
      "I'd rather eat food than sip on shakes all day long but I actually look forward to having one of these at least a couple of times per week. The taste is really good in all the flavors I have tried, mix well, and I have them with plain water! My faves are Whipped Vanilla, Cinnamon Swirl, and Cookies N' Cream (which has little bits of some cookie-like thing). I love this protein mostly because it bakes so well.\n",
      "Highly recommend!\n",
      "Mixes very well with Almond Milk in a shaker cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also makes an incredible protein milkshake with almond milk and ice cubes in a blender. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies and Cream flavor was just awful. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl was delicious.\n",
      "Worst protein I've ever taken. I wouldon't rather get some cheap stuff at Wal-Mart... I literally can't give this crap away.  Do not buy.\n",
      "Amazing product; less carbs than an average scoop of Syntha-6 and (almost) as much flavor. The Cinnamon Swirl is about as good as Cinnamon Bun and Molten Chocolate is vastly superior to Chocolate Milkshake. If there was a casein version of this, I would double down on the Molten Chocolate when it is BOGO50.\n",
      "This is saying a great deal considering Syntha-6 tastes better than... practically everything else on the market (Combat, Gold Standard, etc)\n",
      "i have the PB Marshmallow flavor and this is my first time trying  this brand for protein  and it does get high praise and from going through practically my whole 4lb tub I can see why. The ingredient profile is EXCELLENT with whey isolate being the first source of protein and followed by whey concentrate and it also has digestive enzymes which help with digestion and utilization of the proteins. This protein mixed in water in a shaker cup mixed up perfectly with very little foam and really nothing floating. The PB Marshmallow flavor was pretty good though I really didn't taste any marshmallow but it wasn't an issue cause I'm not big on marshmallow and I got this protein for the peanut flavor which this reminded me of a Squirrel Nut Candy that I loved as a kid. This flavor just needs to be slightly stronger in the peanut flavor and it would definitely score a little higher in rating but it was still enjoyable.\n",
      " I definitely recommend giving this brand a try as well as this flavor a try and I stated this brand get's high praise and after trying this I know why cause it's a QUALITY PROTEIN.\n",
      "I cracked open my 2nd flavor which is the Molten Choc and after going through most of the container this for  me has turned out to be ONE OF THE BEST tasting choc whey's that I have in a long time. Most people stated that this was a dark choc which I was hoping for but it really isn't and it's a VERY RICH milk choc but done perfectly well and a flavor you just can't get tired of and one that I wouldn't mind have 12lbs on hand all the time. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this flavor if you like milk chocolate with a rich taste.\n",
      "I received a 2lb container of the Choc Raspberry Truffle from a promo win and once you open the container and take a sniff of the powder you will say to yourself \"why isn't anyone talking about this flavor\"  If you know what raspberries and choc taste like together then you'll really appreciate this flavor which Cellucor nailed and honestly it could also past as a choc covered cherry flavor also and it wouldn't wrong.  The flavor comes through with a rich milk choc and then you get that tangy berry flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. This is my 3rd choc protein from Cellucor and I must say they really know how to do choc RIGHT!!! I highly recommend giving this flavor a try and I'm puzzled how this flavor isn't rated higher and I WILL be purchasing this flavor in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "After going through a little more than 1/2 of a 4lb container of the Cinnamon Swirl I can see why this is one of Cellucor's highest rated flavors. In a shake it actually taste like Cinnamon Toasted Crunch cereal that's been sitting in milk which is what many have said it tasted like and it's NOT overly sweet so you don't get any bitterness from it which you can get from other cinnamon based proteins that are overly sweetened. This is also a very good flavor if you like to cook or bake with your protein. I highly recommend this flavor if your a fan of cinnamon like I am and will be a flavor I purchase again in the future as well as the other flavors that I've tried so far from Cellucor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently received the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle as a winner through cellucor along with 49 others. I was completely blown away by the taste. This stuff is amazing! Usually, I'm chugging down protein shakes because I find they have a chalky, whey/proteiny powder taste to them. Not this flavor! I could probably polish off the container in a day. Great thing I received another free one yesterday ;) Highly recommend this brand and flavor, especially if you feel you choke down protein shakes too. Amazing quality, amazing brand.\n",
      "Chocolate Peanut Buttaahhhhhhhhhhh! I have never been disappointed with any of the flavors this brand has released, and now they have combined 2 excellent flavors in one! This flavor is very similar to peanut butter marshmallow, but with a great chocolate taste! The peanut butter is the more dominant of the two flavors, but it doesn't completely shutout the chocolate flavor. The consistency, texture, mixability, and flavor are all excellent, with no clumping, even without a blending whisk or blender ball. Smooth and rich, chalk full of taste! Well done once again Cellucor!\n",
      "I got a chance to review Cellucor's new Chocolate PB Protein! I mixed 1 scoop with a cup of skim milk for max flavor. \n",
      "-----\n",
      "Macros and ingredients are the same compared to the other flavors, nothing wrong there. 2f 4c 25p per 36g scoop.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "The chocolate was a creamy flavor, much like the normal chocolate flavor, very good. The peanut butter taste was good, wasn't the absolute best, but it was far from the worst. Overall the taste was really good!\n",
      "-----\n",
      "Cost is $30 for 2 lbs. which is about standard for a top tier protein.\n",
      "This is an incredibly delicious protein flavor! Great chocolate flavor and great macros! Cellucor nailed the flavor on this one! I highly recommend you try this protein flavor, you won't regret it!\n",
      "I recently had the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and it was AMAZING! I highly recommend this flavor. The chocolate isn't the same as the Molten Chocolate. Molten chocolate has a more dark chocolate flavor, but the CRT has more of a milk chocolate flavor. The milk chocolate is perfectly complimented by the raspberry! I've mixed both flavors with milk, water, oats, you name it and it always comes out amazingly delicious! \n",
      "The chocolate peanut butter protein is absolutely amazing tasting! One of the best CPB flavors I've had. The chocolate is a milk chocolate flavor so it doesn't taste like the Molten chocolate, but it tastes like the chocolate in the chocolate raspberry. The infusion of peanut butter is spot on! Not overpowering and not overpowered by the chocolate. I've had this with straight water, milk and water combo, and made proats with it and every combo is fantastic. The peanut butter flavor makes this protein so very good. A must try!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have recently purchased the new Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor. After a few days of trying out this product it is definitely one of my top favorite out of all the other flavors I have tried in the past. When I first opened the tub there is a very strong peanut buttery and chocolate smell. Right away I knew this flavor was going to be amazing! I have used about 6-7 oz. of water in my shaker and within a few seconds the protein mixed very well with the water. No clumps or chunks in any areas of my shaker at all. It was very clean. When I took my first sip I could not believe how fantastic and delicious this flavor was. It tasted exactly like a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup. I could not get tired of drinking it after my workout and wanted to salvage every sip I had. I like how this product contains the whey isolate and concentrate because it will get into my body immediately after my long workouts and I won't have to feel too deteriorated or exhausted. If you have tried various flavors of this product and haven't tried this one I definitely recommend trying this one out!\n",
      "bought the 4lb cinnamon flavor at costco and it is very good, and im usually not that crazy about cinnamon. all the reviewers that say it tastes similar to the milk left over after a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch cereal is pretty much dead on. mixes really well, no clumpiness, and is the best tasting ive had when mixed with just plain water. the other important part is digestability, i get zero bloat or gas from this, unlike muscle pharm combat powder and the arnold mp variation (that tore my gut up).... don't hesitate to give cellucor cor-performance a try, pretty sure you will like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATES on Flavors: Vanilla, Molten Chocolate, and Chocolate Peanut Butter (best flavor) are also pretty good, however, Cookies N Cream is just aweful. It has too much chemical taste to it, and was to \"chocolatey\". Cellucor needs to rework this one, as its not anywhere a CnC taste.\n",
      "I honestly didn't think I would find a flavor that would top Cinnamon Swirl but I think this one did it. I mean it's chocolate and peanut butter mixed together.. It's amazing!!! I used it to make some pancakes, mixed it with water, and then blended it with almond milk, banana, and more pb. If you haven't tried it, you need to get on it. The taste is on point and mixes well!!\n",
      "Tried this because of the sale, Molten Chocolate works for me. Taste is on par with Optimum which is my normal go to. I will buy again. Flavor is good and mixes well enough.\n",
      "don't get the strawberry milkshake one, it doesnt mix well, and tastes worse than other flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "AWESOME protein! Great taste and mixes well. Definitely a great protein powder. \n",
      "I ordered two 2lb tubs of this flavor, so I now have 4 lbs total. At first, when you open the tub, you immediately get a scent of chocolate peanut butter, so overall smell definitely stays true to the name. \n",
      "\n",
      "I scooped the whey out into a bowl and made a sludge with just a few ounces of water and was extremely satisfied with the taste. Has a chocolate peanut butter taste for sure. The macro profile is pretty solid, a little higher in fat and carbs than most other flavors, but since this flavor is really tasty, I wont complain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I will be buying this flavor again\n",
      "I've had my fair share of protein powder, and this one is this worst of them all next to syngex. Taste like butt. I only ordered because it was a sweet buy one get one free deal which came with the cookies and cream 4lb tub for free. Cookies and cream isn't to bad but I'd give it a rating of 5/10 for taste. The deal was awesome, the taste is terrible. I'll stick to my optimum nutrition gold standard, always the best. I give it a5/10 because of the deal I received. \n",
      "I had the mint chocolate which they don't have anymore. Literally tasted like drinking ice cream was great. Mixes very well, occasional little chunk in cold milk. Will purchase in the future.\n",
      "Another great flavor from Cellucor I've always been a major fan of the Cor whey because it's such a lean protein and it tastes a lot better than a lot of its competitors. Usually when I mix whey protein with a water the consistency is rather light and it just tastes like flavored water but that's not the case with all of the Cor Whey flavors. The new chocolate peanut butter flavor and taste amazing and I like mixing it with my oatmeal in the morning. \n",
      "I just love both of these.  Great for my sweet tooth.  Taste great and very smooth mixed in just water.  I also will use this with some ice and almond milk mixed in my ninja blender, and its like a shake for me that I just love.  The quality is very high and I love getting the 2 pound containers and get multiple flavors to keep it mixed up and interesting for me.  i never feel bloated or any stomach issues of any kind.\n",
      "Strong PB taste with a slight taste of chocolate. Thicker than a usual whey, but **** good!! This tasted great over cheerios/bananas. This can be an awesome baked product such as brownies- unfortunately, I cannot bake lol. Good job Cellucor!\n",
      "As soon as you open this tub you get by with the smell of peanut butter cookies. It mixed very easily without any clumps. The taste was incredible. Cellucors whey flavoring is hard to beat and this one is on the top. I will be purchasing more of this flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "This was good flavor for this product. I am a chocolate lover and the taste was good and enjoyable. I found this to be adequate for a Whey Isolate brand and would buy it. It is affordable for the amount you get in the canister.\n",
      "Just got this protein tastes great doesn't have chalky protein taste. No running to the bathroom after drinking it so far so good only taken it for a week so we'll see after I'm done how it is\n",
      "I wrote a review when I first bought these protein powders and now it is two months later and my raspberry truffle is gone but I still have about half of the cinnamon swirl. Throughout finishing the raspberry truffle powder, I noticed that it began to take on a mildew-y smell and taste and when I was done drinking it, the smell lingered in my blender bottle even after washing it myself and putting it through the dish washer. The cinnamon swirl is absolutely disgusting. I can't drink one shake without gagging the entire time and my brother, who has been trying to finish it off with me, has agreed that it tastes horrific. I don't know how it has such high reviews. I could endure drinking raspberry truffle but I can barely choke down cinnamon swirl. The only reason I keep using this powder is because of the BCAAs and the macros. It's aided substantially in my muscles growth but as for taste, both were less than par in comparison to cheaper proteins\n",
      "I love this protein. Hands down it has everything you want in a protein powder, it mixes well you don't get any nasty chunks, it tastes incredible the PB Marshmallow( this flavor takes you back to fluffer nutter sandwiches but without being bad for you) seriously makes every workout worth it just to have it after, unlike most brands it tastes great in water which is awesome if you are at the gym and don't have any milk you don't have to choke down a nasty shake it's still delicious! I will continue using this product and definitely recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "PROS:\n",
      "1.  Easily the best tasting protein on the market\n",
      "2. Very easy on ypur stomach (no digestive problem at all)\n",
      "3. Great for mixing in desserts, with Oats, etc\n",
      "\n",
      "CONS:\n",
      "1.  I still don't understand why companies insist in having ONLY 4lb tubes\n",
      "2. Price is higher than the competence\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a great surprise!\n",
      "The flavour is really awesome, best tasting protein powder I've ever had.  \n",
      "It is though a little bit in the higher price spectrum, but if you have the money and don't care about price, you can't go wrong...\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely something worth to taste & stick to. \n",
      "Compared to others, doesn't  leave that ewwww aftertaste & is digested easily. \n",
      "Just excellent.\n",
      "I ordered this protein due to it being on sale, usually I use gold standard though I use products from BSN, ON, Cellucor, and others so I don't really have any allegiance to any brand. The ingredients themselves are great and it tastes good when mixed, but the mixability is terrible. Usually I mix my protein with milk in a blender bottle with the blender ball. The first time it didn't mix well with clumps and the last bit being an extremely thick, undrinkable mess that wouldn't slide out of the botlle. I then moved away from the 2% milk down to skim thinking that would make a difference, it still didn't and I have to mark it down for that especially when it says on the container \"mixes easily\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "As far as nutrition goes via protein/calorie ratio compared to most other protein powders on the market, Cellucor beats out most of its competitors. Muscle Milk boasts a meager 16g protein/150 calories per scoop compared to Cellucor's 25g/130 (depending on the flavor). HOWEVER, I would buy Muscle Milk hands down for the taste alone. I don't know if it's Cellucor's blend or the flavors they use, but each one of my powders had this sickly sweet, disgusting, nasty, horrible (yes I consulted my thesaurus) aftertaste that I have to hide with either instant coffee, cocoa powder, or in the case of the Cinnamon Swirl flavor, pumpkin pie spices just to attempt to cover it up and make it drinkable. I don't look forward to my morning after workout smoothies and I try to gulp them down as fast as possible. I made the mistake of taking advantage of a sale Bodybuilding.com was having and ended up buying 6 flavors. Not one of my finer moments. Along with proper diet and exercise and this supplement only taken in the morning, I've lost a few inches all over my body, however I'm never purchasing this stuff again.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite whey protein. Chocolate, peanut butter marshmallow, cinnamon swirl are my favorites. Vanilla & mint chocolate chip were about equal in my opinion. I've tried others but the flavors of cellucor are my favorite and blend so good in shakes & protein recipes.\n",
      "all these flavors suck. hoping that its still a good product because id seriously hate to waste money on 3 tubs seeing as i bought as a promotion. maybe im picky. sticking with the Iso 100 in the future. flavor game just does not match up. will never purchase again.\n",
      "I personally will buy it again. It taste better than some of the proteins I have had. \n",
      "Strawberry Milkshake taste a lot better with milk than water. \n",
      "But Molten Chocolate taste very good in both water and milk. (Good for baking too!)\n",
      "It is not very filling which is nice in some circumstances, but not if you're trying to fill in for a meal...\n",
      "I give it a 9 rating overall!!! A good buy, I promise!\n",
      "I've bought a lot of protein powder brands and Cellucor protein powder is the best tasting that I've bought in a long time. It mixes easy with a blender bottle with no clumps. \n",
      "This is our favorite protein powder. We use it for several things but we mix it in our oats every morning mostly.  It mixes well and taste great!  \n",
      "Love this protein and i trust it withy life. \n",
      "11/10 would buy again.\n",
      "My favorite protein definitely recommend to anyone. Mixes easily and doesn't cause bloating. Must buy!\n",
      "Seriously the best flavors of protein powder. Molten chocolate has been my favorite for a while; however, I recently tried the chocolate raspberry truffle and it blew my mind! Such a delicious complex flavor for a protein powder! Cinnamon swirl and vanilla are pretty bomb also. Perfect to bake with all, but these two are awesome to make pancakes and waffles with. Blended with some almond milk and ice to make a shake or 'ice cream' definitely fills your sweet tooth at night if you need a treat. Cookies and cream was good, just not my favorite, a little on the sweet side. It's perfect blended with some frozen yogurt though! Keep the great flavors coming Cellucor! :)\n",
      "This is by far my favorite whey protein supplement that I have tried so far. The taste and mixability are superb and I couldn’t find anything to complain about. All of the flavor I have tried thus far have been nothing short of great. My top favorites include: Cinnamon Swirl, Corfetti, Molten Chocolate.\n",
      "Peanut butter marshmallow is my absolute favorite whey protein I've ever tasted. I look forward to drinking after my workout. I mix it with water and I still think it's equivalent to drinking a milkshake. Cinnamon swirl is delicious too but I'm just so stuck on peanut butter marshmallow it's hard to top it. Also baking with peanut butter marshmallow is amazing! \n",
      "I've tried many flavors or cor-performance whey and have never been disappointed. The flavors are phenomenal and the protein mixes great. My favorite is molten chocolate, but mixing peanut butter marshmallow with molten chocolate is a close second.\n",
      "Great macros, good price. Flavors are all excellent with cellucor. Best overall tasting brand I've had. Also cinnamon swirl is the hands down best protein Pancake protein I've found. \n",
      "Cor Performance Whey is my favorite whey protein powder. It is high in protein, low in fat and carbs making it easy for anyone to fit it into their macros. The taste is one of the best too. All of the flavors I have tried are amazing. The Cinnamon Swirl is great in oatmeal or as pancakes. The peanut butter marshmallow has a nice blend of both peanut butter and marshmallow. I love adding it to plain greek yogurt. This powder bakes very well. I usually bake with whey so this is a positive.\n",
      "I will be honest I was a little skeptical about trying this flavor and kept putting it off until I was given a trial sample pack of it and WOW I should of smacked myself for waiting so long to try it! When you first open it up you get a refreshing raspberry aroma then you get the chocolate coming in right behind it which makes it smell like cake actually. To me anything raspberry can be too potent especially if it's an artificial flavoring but I felt there was an equal balance of raspberry and chocolate which played off of each other perfectly. Even when I mixed it with just 10 ounces of cold water the flavor was just right and very enjoyable. Like I said before it tasted like cake. The mixibility just like all of cellucor products mixed up perfectly with no clumps at all. Overall this flavor came out to be a top three cor whey flavor for me and it's a must try for anybody who hasn't tried it yet! You're missing out!\n",
      "I love this protein powder, because nothe only does it taste good, but it also always mixes smooth. Nothing is worse than having a grity mess at the bottom of your shaker. I like the cinnamon swirl flavor the best, and the last tub that I got had the scoop right on top lol! \n",
      "After trying other brands I have to say Cellucor is one of best ones out there offering a lot of different varieties of supplements. What I like most are the flavors, I don't like the taste of protein powders but with the vanilla it was actually good and mixing it with fruit is even better. But after trying molten chocolate whey, I was in love with it. After taking it for 4 months I gained 10 pounds of muscle working out 5-6 times a week body weight calisthenics only. I'm 6ft tall and weigh 170 lbs. I love the brand and supplements even more.\n",
      "Great mixing and great tasting protein to cure any sweet tooth. I mix it with vanilla Greek yogurt and it makes a quick healthy snack. Also can mix it with milk and ice and throw in a whole Oreo or 2. Great product and never dissatisfied with Cellucor products.\n",
      "By far the best tasting protein out on the market today.    Aside from its great taste- it's a great quality product.  This is the only protein powder I will drink.  \n",
      "This particular flavor is one of my favorites but SERIOUSLY  every flavor is AHHHMAZING! Use this protein t mix with yogurt, brownies , just as a shake or whatever your heart desires! It is simply great for anything. You won't be disappointed \n",
      "I take Cor-Performance Whey every day, 3 scoops with my oats after my morning workouts (Monday-Friday), and 2 scoops with my cereal first thing in the morning (Saturday-Sunday).  I also sometimes take 2 scoops as a sludge, simply mixed with a bit of water, on a piece of bread.  With oats, I really enjoy the Cinnamon Swirl, Molten Chocolate (with 1 tsp of cinnamon), Peanut Butter Marshmallow, Strawberry Milkshake, Whipped Vanilla (with 1/4 cup of PB2), and Cookies N' Cream.  With my cereal, I usually stick with Cinnamon Swirl or Cookies N' Cream.  As a sludge, I really like the Peanut Butter Marshmallow, although I sometimes use Cinnamon Swirl or Whipped Vanilla (with 2 tbsp of PB2).  All of the flavors mix very well in oats (as opposed to pure isolates, which tend to be too watery), and they all make a great sludge with just water.  Also, the Strawberry Milkshake flavor is great mixed with Greek yogurt and a bit of unsweetened almond milk.  Strawberry Milkshake must be the most underrated flavor of the bunch.  I think it is absolutely delicious.  Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is not my favorite flavor -- it's not bad, but I like all the other flavors more.  I am hoping that Cellucor will bring back S'Mores, since that is possibly the best protein powder I have ever taken.  I give the S'Mores flavor a solid 11/10.\n",
      "This whey is excellent. The macros are solid, mixes without any issues, comes from a company you can trust, and it is very affordable compared to other options (especially when they are having deals). I tried the chocolate raspberry truffle, and it was actually quite good, but definitely a little different. This might not be normal, but trying a little bit of the powder dry gives a really good gauge of the actual flavor. When I tried the dry powder the chocolate flavor hit me at first, and then I got the raspberry after. It reminded me of one of those chocolates with the raspberry filling. Shakes weren't quite as strong in providing the two separate taste sensations, but they were still quite good. They produce a sweet chocolate/raspberry flavor that is a little different, but was sort of a nice curveball for my taste buds. If you are getting sick of the same old CnC, Chocolate, and Vanilla this might be a good change! Solid product, decent flavor.\n",
      "Great flavor, and easily mixes. \n",
      "This is the third brand of whey protein I've tried and this is so far the best! It tastes amazing and mixed very well in water. Also used it in protein cheesecake recipe and would 10/10 recommend everyone to try it.\n",
      "Horrible product! I've tried them all since this crap is always on sale. Only reason to buy is for cheap whey. Chocolate Raspberry Truffle makes me sick. Just the smell alone is effing disgusting. Mixability is probably the worst out of any proteins I have ever tried. I would pass on any flavor of this protein even of on sale which it always is. Garbage all around.\n",
      "I am a big, big fan of the peanut butter marshmallow flavor.  This flavor whey is great for baking, making oatmeal taste like dessert, and also making protein shakes incredibly flavorful.  I haven't had a chance to try other flavors, but I can say that this one actually exceeded my expectations!  If you haven't tried this yet, and you are looking for a new whey protein to try out, don't hesitate to try this one! \n",
      "Always has been one of my go too protein shakes for the past 4 years. I was a collegiate lacrosse player and the amount I was on the field and in the gym, it was hard to get all my meals in. This is a great anytime protein shake. Whether you're looking for a quick protein fix throughout the day while running around or a post workout protein shake... this is definitely a product that I would recommend. I have never had any bad experience with Cellucor products. Great product to feed those worked muscles!!\n",
      "I love this protein, it tastes amazing and fills me up.  I usually mix mine with unsweetened almond milk.  I bought the cookies & cream first and it was okay, but I needed variety.  So I bought Cinnamon Swirl, Molten Chocolate, and Peanut butter Marshmallow.  The cinnamon swirl is spot on, it is light and goes down easy (It's always gone before I know it), a lot of people mix it with pancakes, but I haven't gotten the chance to.  The molten chocolate gives me my chocolate fix in the middle of the day or after dinner when I want something sweet, I wish I had bought this in the first place because it's delicious.  The peanut butter marshmallow is good definitely a lot of peanut butter taste and the marshmallow is an after note.  Cellucor was my first protein I tried, and I love it.  I've gotten some samples of other brands, but they never mix as well or taste as delicious as Cellucor.\n",
      "One of the best saver bundles out there. I have to say the flavor, macros, mix-ability and everything is spot on. And no fillers. Overall, a trustworthy brand putting out a great tub of protein. \n",
      "This protein is awesome. I went through some peanut butter cravings on a cut & this whey really helped me get through it. Peanut Butter Marshmallow is legit good. As for the mint chocolate chip, it's one of my fav to make protein ice cream or blend w/ice for a delicious macro friendly treat. I HIGHLY recommend.\n",
      "One of the best tasting, quality, non spiked protein on the market. Love the peanut butter marshmallow in oats. All flavors are good. Highly recommend it.\n",
      "Cor whey is a really solid protein powder. The profile and macros are pretty good, especially for the price, and you can trust that Cellucor isn't amino-spiking or anything crazy like that. I've used Cor whey in shakes, proats, sludge, and for baking, and the different flavors are very versatile and work well for all of those applications. I loved cinnamon swirl and PB Marshmallow, and Cookies & Cream was solid but not my favorite.\n",
      "Really great protein, great mix-ability and great texture. The cinnamon swirl and peanut butter marshmallow are both incredible tasting \n",
      "They make the best Cookie's N Cream flavor on the market, hands down. If you see a sale, take advantage of it!\n",
      "Awesome flavor and mixes great. Honestly the best tasting protein I have ever had. Cinnamon Swirl smells incredible and Peanut Butter marshmallow reminds me of a Peanut Butter and Fluff sandwich. YUM!\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the Peanut Butter Marshmallow and S'mores flavors! I always put the peanut butter flavor in my oatmeal.\n",
      "I tried the smores flavor a while ago and loved it. I don't know why it isn't on the site anymore but it is an excellent flavor. It was better than most chocolate powders out there. There were even small pieces of marshmallow and graham cracker in the powder. The texture is great when using just water and it mixes perfectly.  The protein uses high quality whey isolate and concentrate for fast absorption and quicker recovery. I noticed a faster recovery after I take this powder. The powder is also excellent for baking. I made smores protein brownies with the powder and they were amazing. I will be trying more of their flavors in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using protein powders forever and this is one of the best tasting, best mixing, and best \"pudding-making” proteins I've used! Thank you, Cellucor for a great overall product! Peanut butter marshmallow is awesome!!\n",
      "This protein is very well made, it mixes quickly and easily with my skim milk. Taste is amazing. Even my wife (who hates diet type food and drinks) thought it was delicious. So far I love it. I also have molten chocolate and cinnamon swirl which I will try soon enough. \n",
      "Recovery time:\n",
      "Had two good workouts with this protein afterwards and the recovery was very good. Very little soreness and only for a day.\n",
      "This is the best protein powder I've tried so far. It's seriously like a milkshake. I mix it with coffee and skim milk and it is DEEEEEELICIOUS! Don't try mixing it without a blender bottle and shaker ball. It will be too chunky. I haven't tried any of the other flavors yet, but I will be!\n",
      "So Far so Good.  Some people must be trying to mix this with a spoon.  I put it in shaker with the blender ball, and if mixes just fine. Milkshake consistency wien no clumps.  Also, peanut butter marshmallow taste post good.\n",
      "I'm sure this is a great protien powder in terms of quality ingredients but it mixes poorly and tastes like something out of the 1990's. Back to ON for me..... I passed this one on to my Dad.......\n",
      "Tastes great! \n",
      "My favorite mix is  half a cup of water or enough to cover the blades on your blender, than blend for  30sec, add peanut butter and add 3 cubes of ices. Let blend for another 30sec. Enjoy and relax after that great workout you just had. Trust me, just try  it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Your welcome. ;)\n",
      "Average taste and doesn't mix for crap but it's amazing for putting it in your waffles, or anything you are baking bread with that you wanna add some extra protein too\n",
      "Improve the taste of the product please! I've tried GoldStandard and Dymatize Whey Protein so far and the tastes are by far superior. I bought this product because of the buy 2 get 1 free deal on Bodybuilding.com\n",
      "I love this protein! It's good in smoothies, mixing in yogurt and making oatmeal raisin protein cookies too!\n",
      "Love this protein. Flavor is amazing and it mixes very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this protein, the peanut butter marshmallows taste amazing, especially if you add some chocolate protein. This protein has quality ingredients, effective, and gets me fueled up for my workout or the day. I do enjoy adding a little to my cappuccino instead of sugar. I'm a huge fan of the peanut butter marshmallows, not so much the others. If you're looking for quality protein and a good price, this is a great buy.\n",
      "Mixed with water, Cookies N' Cream was average at best\n",
      "This is the best protein I've had so far, if you have a good blender I recommend blending the powder with ice and a little water...tastes like ice cream it's crazy! its also okay in just a blender bottle but using a legit blender is the way to go. \n",
      "I've had/ continually buy the following flavors: \n",
      "Cookies 'n cream-10\n",
      "Chocolate raspberry truffle- 9\n",
      "Peanut butter marshmallow- 8\n",
      "Cookies 'n cream actually has bits of chocolate crunchies in it. It's my favorite so far. The chocolate raspberry truffle reminds me of a chocolate raspberry  souffle. The texture is just slightly thicker and it tastes like a dessert (may be too rich for some). It makes the BEST mugcakes. Peanut butter marshmallow has a subtle pb flavor- I don't like drinking it with water (i haven't tried it with almond milk yet) but the protein pancakes are gifts from heaven. \n",
      "If you really like raspberry, I suppose this would be a great flavor for you. The raspberry really overpowers the chocolate. I mix this with chocolate shakeology a  lot and it does taste good, but for me too much raspberry. \n",
      "Wow! Really great taste. Can't wait to try another. Easy to mix.\n",
      "The powder doesn't  mix well and the taste is horrible. \n",
      "Unless you mix in a blender all the time you will have chunks on your spoon, side of glass and all through the mix. It does work however with recovery and absorption into my system, but so do most whey products here. I tend to base my judgment on whether I can stomach it and I just about gagged the first time I tried it. I would only buy again if they were almost giving it away.\n",
      "I did not like this powder at all. It doesn't mix well in any of my shaker cups. It just makes giant clumps no matter what you do. I tried both the chocolate raspberry truffle and the cookies and cream and don't like either flavor. The raspberry truffle would be okay if you're looking for a just a semi-artificial raspberry flavoring, but don't expect it to be something chocolate-y and indulgent. The cookies and cream is VERY sickly sweet. I can't even force myself to drink it.\n",
      "This stuff is DELICIOUS! Great value too!\n",
      "How can anyone like this??? It tastes like a combination of DUST and cheap (bad) vanilla protein powder. YUCK. Did I get a bad batch?\n",
      "Was really excited when reading the reviews about Cor-Fetti, but mine tastes NOTHING like cake batter.\n",
      "flavor was ok. tastes like fake sweetener\n",
      "I like the cellucor whey proteins except the cookies n cream.  Gave me bad digestive issues (bloating, gas, you can guess the rest) I'd stay away from cookies n cream but besides it is good stuff.  Their customer support is also awesome!\n",
      "It mixes up kind of thick for a whey, but still fairly easily so as not to leave any chunks. Cinnamon swirl tastes very strongly of cinnamon and is great in both milk and water. I particularly enjoy it in oats. Peanut butter marshmallow is sweeter than the cinnamon and tastes great as a shake, especially in milk. Like drinking liquid peanut butter.\n",
      "This is my absolute favorite protein powder and flavor. It's perfect for mixing into oatmeal or just on it's own with almond milk. Really natural tasting and smooth!\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been a great whey protein. I've definitely noticed a difference in my performance in the gym and have gained more weight now than when I used other proteins. The flavors are on point. Mint chocolate chip tastes amazing. If your in search of a new protein supp I would try this one for sure. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll just rate on flavor and drink ability. The flavor itself is not great, and not bad. I won't be buying it again but hey everyone's different. It developed a foamy top to it in my shaker, and the cookie chocolate chip things settle to the bottom in my shaker as well. I don't re-shake it all up before/during when I drink it either, because it'll just get 'frothier'.\n",
      "Cellucor is by far my favorite protein powder. The flavors are amazing, and I love that they are slightly thicker than other proteins. I am on a whipped vanilla kick currently. I blend in some strawberries and almond milk for my nightly proyo. S'mores is amazing as a sludge with some almond butter, I love the chunks of graham crackers and marshmallows! Cinnamon swirl was great to bake with. PB marshmallow was just ok for me, the flavor was more marshmallow than peanut butter. Personally, I couldn't stomach the cake batter- it was way too sweet! Mint chocolate chip was good, but I got sick of it easily. Next on my list is cookies and cream! \n",
      "One of my favorite proteins for sure.\n",
      "Great flavors and taste is amazing especially peanut butter marshmallow. Also helps me recover after cardio .\n",
      "I really enjoy my breakfast and post-workout shakes. I mix one scoop of Molten Chocolate with 8oz. (60 cal) of Silk Original Cashew Milk and it might as well be a chocolate milkshake. Super creamy and thick. I used to use almond milk but I truly hate the stuff. I switched to cashew milk and it changed everything for me. I began with the unsweetened at 25 calories per 8oz. which gave it a weird taste once it was mixed but I will work in the extra 35 calories just for the enjoyment of my shake because it doesn't give it the weird taste. I've tried sample packs of other flavors and I just did not like them as well. The Cinnamon Swirl or Whipped Vanilla would be my second choices if I couldn't have the Molten Chocolate.\n",
      "The mint chocolate chip is unbearable- I cannot find a way to use it and now I have over half a tub left and no way to stomach taking it. The other flavors are more bearable but they really need to find a way to make this more tasty-like BSN or Pro JYM- the low rating is obviously for the Mint choc. chip\n",
      "It doesn't mix well at all compared to other proteins it takes forever for the powder to dissolve and the taste is horrible. Disappointing\n",
      "I loved this protein.\n",
      "Bought two small jars to give them a try and I was pretty satisfied. They mix well and have a creamy unique texture.\n",
      "The flavors feel very natural. I didn't quite like the cinnamon flavor, but that's just me. My brother fell in love with it. The peanut butter marshmallow, actually tastes like real peanut butter, I loved it!!\n",
      "Even though I think there is better, but this is also a very good protein!\n",
      "Amazing flavor! I use this to make my famous protein bars. \n",
      "Not a bad product. I have tried every major product over the past 10 years. Mixes well and is lite on my sensitive stomach (I am lactose intolerant). \n",
      "\n",
      "The Peanut Butter Marshmallow taste is rubbish. Barely exists. You almost rely on your sense of small to know that the product is flavoured in some way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe just try another flavour??\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: Just tried the Cinnamon Swirl flavour - it is the worst flavour imaginable. It seriously is unbearable. Smell is foul, and tastes nothing like cinnamon, more like an expired caramel. Straight in the bin!!!\n",
      "I have tried more than a dozen types of whey proteins, and none of them compare to this product. I have an extremely sensitive stomach and nothing seems to work well with me. I also have a hard time getting down any protein because of flavor.. (also VERY picky about that,) but this has worked amazing for me. The taste is great. This is the first protein I've been able to drink with water instead of some type of milk. There is no chalky taste, it mixes well, has a sweet taste but no artificial flavor, and I love the little marshmallows. There's no heavy feeling after I drink it and no bloating. Will definitely be reordering to try different flavors. I reallllly hope the Smores flavor sticks around. I'm so happy I finally found this!\n",
      "I love the taste and mix ability of Cellucor COR-Performance Whey.  I use a little bit of water and make a pudding vs a traditional protein shake.  Cinnamon Swirl maybe my favorite and Molten Chocolate tastes like a chocolate syrup!  \n",
      "The chocolate raspberry truffle flavor is disgusting. It doesn't mix well either. It was gritty with chunks and the artificial flavor makes it much worse. Stick with chocolate or cinnamon.\n",
      "best whey protein out there. good in milk. good in water. good as a beltsander brownie. this is just a great, solid product. but i expect nothing less from Cellucor!\n",
      "\n",
      "Best Whey ever. No doubt. I have been hit and miss with whey proteins in the past, but this is by far the best out there. \n",
      "I got a sample of Cellucor in my WOD Box and was so impressed that I just had to buy more! The chocolate molten is delicious and doesn't have that chalky taste that most protein shakes have. I have a lot of issues with getting sour stomach and indigestion after drinking protein shakes, but this one digests 100% fine for me. I mostly drink this after Crossfit, but I often make one when I don't have time for breakfast or lunch and it keeps me full for a while. It's great for curbing my chocolate and dessert cravings too. I will definitely be buying more of this product again.\n",
      "Ever Just find a product you love and buy over and over. Well this is it! all of the Flavors I have used of Cellucor Whey are super tasty, vanilla, PB marsh and this molten chocolate. I love this product because first the profile 1.5 g of fat, 4 g carbs, 25g Protein. This is pretty standard, fats and carbs aren't high like some others, and cellucor has never been involved with the spiking issues that are currently happening. This protein mixes super smooth in water, and gets nice and thick in almond milk and even better in 2 percent milk! They way I use this most often is in oats/cream of rice, and the fact that it doesn't clumb and bakes well is another thumbs up! And some people complain about digestion, zero issues with that and have used as much as 2.5 scoops while baking!  I have been using this protein since it came out and even used the old one Cellucor Sport maybe in the plastic bag. All in all This is always going to be in my supplement cupboard. \n",
      "I have to say that is an amazing tasting protein! I cant wait to try some more flavors! I use it in all kinds of different ways. But even with just water, I can easily drink it, which is not common for most proteins. I dont think Ill change brands because I love it that much.\n",
      "This flavor tasted amazing, and was very filling for pre/post workout shake as needed. The only issue I've had is no matter if I put my powder in first or water it has some \"gunking\" on the sides of my shaker that I have to scoop out when I wash the shakers. I've noticed this happening on their thicker shakes (chocolate, peanut butter marshmellow) but I absolutely love the flavor!!\n",
      "This is so thick and creamy and just overall delicious! My new favorite flavor is Mint Chip! The absolute best protein ever. I will continue to buy this :)\n",
      "This is my favorite protein powder! I've tried most of the flavors but Cinnamon swirl is my favorite! It's awesome to put in your oatmeal, protein ice cream, on its own or bake with (protein pancakes/waffles... This protein powder with 1/2 serving of either Kodiak Cake mix or flapjacked pancake mix go super well together) Cinnamon swirl is my favorite to bake or put in oatmeal. I also love S'mores, Peanut Butter Marshmallow & Red Velvet. I liked the cor-fetti in my oatmeal but it is very sweet so don't order that flavor if you don't like anything too sweet. My mom's all time favorite is Mint Chocolate chip, it tastes exactly how it sounds. We've never tried the vanilla or strawberry. The chocolate one is a good basic chocolate protein powder, doesn't seem too special when you have all the other flavors to choose from but does taste good mixed with peanut butter if you're like me and love anything peanut butter and chocolate! It's currently my favorite protein! If you're looking for a new one to try then give this protein a go :)\n",
      "I bought the bundled deal with 3 two pound containers and C4X50.  The Mint Chocolate was my favorite of the 3.  Great flavor and mixed well.  It has some small specs of chocolate in it but you don't feel them in your mouth when drinking.  The molten chocolate isn't bad but I have had other chocolate wheys that tasted better.  It did mix very well. S'mores is ok.  The flavor needs improvement and it has some grainy bits in it that don't mix.  I'm not sure what they are but they get stuck in your teeth and you can feel them in your mouth when you drink it.  For me, this is a strong negative and I will not buy this flavor again.  Also a lot of them just stick to the bottom of your cup.  As an experiment I mixed some up in my vitamix blender and that took care of the little bits but I usually only drink my protein post workout in the car as I leave the gym so the vitamix isn't the best option for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only mix with water and a shaker cup for those interested.\n",
      "Cellucor is my favorite whey protein powder right now. S'mores is my absolute favorite, it's extremely versatile and not too sweet. Cinnamon swirl is my second favorite, it's delicious! PB Marshmallow was good for switching things up, I mostly bake with it. Mint Chocolate Chip and Cor-Fetti were way too sweet for me. \n",
      "My very first whey protein experience ever! I like how recently cellucor has made their whey protein much more smoother and easier to blend so nothing sticks at the bottom of your blender bottle. My personal favorite flavor is the Cinnamon Swirl as it satisfies my \"sweet tooth\" for me after a good workout! I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking to build muscle and get big.\n",
      "i've had most of the flavors in this line and love them all. I will never buy another protein except for Cellucor!!\n",
      "Taste and mixes great. My favorite protein because I don't have to force it down because of taste.\n",
      "Great whey for a very reasonable price. Can't get much more pure as far as fat and carb content (virtually none) either. PB Marshmallow and S'mores flavors are super on point, the Mint Chocolate Chip leaves some things to be desired (for me) as the mint runs the show by a long shot and makes for an overpowering taste experience. If mint is your thing you'll love it; it's like a strong York peppermint pattie. I'm excited to try the normal 3 flavors (vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry) as well as the cookies n cream. Check out the Cellucor stacks with these, guys! The price went up slightly recently but still amazing value for a few of these + your fav C4 or aminos. Can make a sampler out of it and try all the flavors.\n",
      "Just got the product. Tastes REALLY good. Unlike other powders I've had. It also has the crunchy small marshmallows in it too that you'd get in hot cocoa mixes. Yum. (:\n",
      "Best Whey out there! I am Lactose intolerant and this is the first and only Whey I have found that doesn't destroy my stomach. Also, the flavors are amazing. No more terrible chocolate or vanilla. Haven't had a bad flavor yet!\n",
      "My new favorite protein powder! The Macros are great and the Peanut Butter Marshmallow taste amazing!\n",
      "My first whey and what an experience, cellucor products are really premium products and they taste amazing. I had taken the chocolate raspberry it was amazing totally loved the experience will try molten chocolate now.\n",
      "This is now my favorite protein powder to buy. I have always like Cellucor's brand but this S'Mores protein is awesome. It has little chunks of graham cracker and tiny marshmallows in it (think hot coco marshmallows) and it is not overly sweet at all. To top it all off it only has 3g of sugar in it. I hope this flavor stays around!\n",
      "Smores is my favorite protein powder! I love to mix it into my iced coffee in the morning or make mug cakes as a snack. The little marshmallows inside make u feel like you are having dessert all day ❤️❤️❤️\n",
      "Cellucor.com code CORFIT gets u 25% off plus free shipping! \n",
      "\n",
      "Solid profile for a lean protein powder, low fat, high protein percentage by weight, what more can you want? The flavors are amazing, and imo the Mint Chocolate Chip is amazing, it's so good it's indescribable! The Strawberry is also one of the best ones I've ever tasted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucor offers some of the best flavors on the market. Not only are they rich and tasty, but they mix well in water OR milk/almond milk. I love getting creative, making protein pancakes/waffles, mug cakes and smoothies with their proteins. Highly recommended for those trying to manage their sweet tooth!\n",
      "\n",
      "The smore's powder has some tiny  bits that are crunchy and stay crunchy after mixing, giving it a nice texture in the shake but  to sweet for my taste .\n",
      "This is by far one of my favorite protein powders! I'm obsessed with peanut butter anything so that was a must for me. The cookies n cream was more like a glorified vanilla so I only use it to flavor my oatmeal. I will definitely be reordering and trying new flavors!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the taste and mix ability of the Whey Core Cookies N Cream. Also love the Strawberry Milkshake. Great for post workout and for my morning mass shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm no example model of what an \"In-shape\" bro is but I do my best as working dad who happens to be in the National Guard so I stay in the best shape as I can be. I'm always looking at making gains and improving myself. This stuff is pretty great. I've tried other whey and this stuff is going to keep my focus. It dissolves wonderfully and I feel awesome after taking it. It digests so quickly that I actually feel the nutrients calming my body down after a long workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the Peanut Butter Marshmallow which was alright. The marshmallow part kind of ruins the PB taste. I ended up creating a shake out of it to improve the flavor. 4 Ice cubes, 2 table spoons of PB, Milk, and a banana. Mix it all up and it's incredible. A little reward for working so hard.\n",
      "This is one of the worst proteins I have used. It was gritty and refused to blend in my shakers. I tried blending it several ways, finding the best way was to shake in a blender bottle with water between 1-2 minutes (which is a lot of shaking). After this, I still found there to be powder on the lid that never dissolved. It is frustrating since dissolution seems like one of the basic qualities of a good protein powder. \n",
      "I love the cinnamon swirl but the red velvet makes me want to puke.\n",
      "I made ice cream out of cor fetti  I see this in a whole new light. I just mixed with banana and blended.  I drink it with just water normally after a workout or mix with yogurt and cashews or macadamia nuts. I was hoping to reorder with this went out but no. The red velvet was sweet and tastes like a treat but wasn't like red velvet to be I still use it because of the taste I look forward to trying other flavors like cinnamon or maybe vanilla kind because of these.  I am not disappointed in these they didn't get back shelf I have became spoiled now. Cinnamon swirl I thought would taste like cinnamon bun but no I mix it with vanilla flavors or use it green shake the taste is too much.\n",
      "This is a good whey protein for sure; it definitely gets the job done.  One thing I've noticed is it doesn't mix completely, but it's barely noticeable and doesn't effect the taste.  Maybe I've been spoiled because I usually use BSN Syntha 6, but this just doesn't taste as great or mix as well as I think a protein should.  But like I said, still a good protein and it gets the job done.\n",
      "Great protein.  So far I have tried the cinnamon swirl and PBM.  PBM is much better than the cinnamon.  TBH, I don't like the flavour that much and can't drink it everyday like some of the other flavours.  It's protein, good profile, low calories and good for baking.  Made some pancakes with a scoop of it and it tasted great!  Solid protein!\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is off the charts. Its very smooth and helps me recover fast. I highly recommend\n",
      "Cookies n cream is not the best flavor, I would recommend cinnamon swirl. The gold star in protein in my books, I hardly use anything else unless the sale is too good to pass up. \n",
      "Cellucor Whey is my go to protein, only protein I take post workout. Not only does it help me recover but the peanut butter marshmallow tastes amazing, by far the best flavor of protein out their. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good protein that tastes great.\n",
      "This is a great product! It tastes great when mixed with milk, as well as when I add peanut butter and a little ice cream for creaminess and more calories, without having to buy the mass gainer version. I am looking forward to buying more in the future! \n",
      "I freaking love this protein.  I have tried a lot of the flavors and Molten Chocolate is my favorite, hands down.  It taste like hot chocolate that was made with milk.  Its sweet, but not too sweet, and creamy but not too thick.  It mixes really well, even if the water is warm.  \n",
      "I love Cellucor protein!! I've had the Vanilla, Chocolate, Cor-tetti and Cinnamon. All the flavors have been delicious! They dissolve very well in a shaker bottle, clumps have never been an issue. I've also used this protein in various recipes with great success. \n",
      "This is the best protein powder I've ever had! I didn't want to get chocolate because I always get chocolate flavored protein and I made a great decision! I have the mint chocolate chip protein with vanilla almond milk and it tastes just like a milk shake! I would definitely buy it again and recommend it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't like the vanilla flavor, i was expecting something more flavorful not what i was expecting. \n",
      "Good protein powder, I've tried the flavors-s'mores,  cake batter, and cinnamon. Each were good. The cinnamon is spot on in oats.\n",
      "About 5 months back BodyBuilding.com was awesome enough to send me a gym bag full of goodies, which included to trial size tubs of COR-Performance Whey in Cinnamon swirl & S'mores. I loved them both, but the S'mores completely won me over. Neither flavor was too sweet or overpowering, but enjoyable. I was sad to see the S'mores taken off the site, so I am super stoked to see it back! I will definitely be buying more!\n",
      "Love cinnamon swirl! Tastes so good! Sometimes i like to add a little extra cinnamon, but its fine without it! I mix it with almond milk! I have had strawberry milkshake, PB marshmallow, smores, cookies n cream, and corfetti. Cinnamon swirl is by the best and then either PB marshmellow or cookies n cream!\n",
      "Love Cellucor products, but tried their Whey for the first time and tastes like vomit. I recommend using MusclePharm Whey Diesel (vanilla). \n",
      "Really disappointed to give this product a 9. It is fantastic in every where. It tastes great when you mix it with milk. I can't tell the difference between this and store bought chocolate milk. I only am giving this product a 9 because it's so expensive. $80 for the big tub is out of my price range and had it not been on sale I probably wouldn't have been able to get it. If it ever goes on sale again this is my go to protein\n",
      "I love Cellulor for their C4 products so i decided to try their protein.\n",
      "**** Cinnamon Swirl tastes awesome! I feel like im not drinking a protein shake but something from starbucks. i do mix my protein with 50% soy milk and 50% water but still i get the full blast of flavor! definitely recommended for any cinnamon lovers out there!\n",
      "I think my ratings here speak for themselves.  I was really excited to try the Cor-fetti because I love Cake batter ANYTHING, but I did not enjoy the taste of this variety.  The Chocolate Mint, however, is HEAVENLY!!!\n",
      "Best tasting protein I've ever had\n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked this protein. Good taste, easy mixing. The only thing is that it's little bit expensive.\n",
      "My wife and I started using this powder and liked it so much we just re-upped with 2 big jugs(forgot the amount).  It taste good.   We like to mix it with almond milk.\n",
      "My favorite tasting whey protein that i have ever consumed, mint chocolate chip actually has little chocolate chips in it which makes it taste that much better. Also had cinnamon swirl which wasnt as good maybe a 7/10. But while taking this protein i went from about 183 and 17 percent body fat down to around 175ish and hig 15 percent body fat so it has been working well for me!\n",
      "Not a fan of this product. I did not have any adverse reactions to this product so I wouldn't bash it. But as far as taste, and mixing goes this product is terrible. I mix with water and I never had one shake out of the (3) 2lb tubs that wasn't chunky. Regret buying that many but they were buy 2 get 1. Will not buy again.\n",
      "One of the best tasting protein powders I have ever tried.  It mixes great, tastes great, and is very macro friendly.  I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Again I got one day shipping when I clicked 5 day amazing shipping always now this protein literally taste like melted ice cream I love it soo mutch this is so good it taste just like mint chocolate chip ice cream.\n",
      "Awesome mixes well and flavor I will definitely be picking up some more of this. \n",
      "Cellucor certainly built a great reputation off of its pre-workout (which, by the way, is like lightning in powder form.) and they have continued such reputation with their Whey. Cellucor Whey has helped me gain some lean muscle while using it, but the best part is the taste. The Cinnamon Swirl flavor is the absolute best flavor of any Whey i have ever tried, although it tastes more like mocha to me than cinnamon. The Red Velvet flavor is ok, tastes pretty much like chocolate with some cherry flavoring. All in all this is a great product which i would not only get again and again, but would recommend to everyone!\n",
      "Great tasting powder. Actually, the best tasting protein on the market. I used Dynamtize ISO-100 for a couple years and never once strayed away from it. Then I started taking Cellucor Super HD, Then I bought C-4 then I thought ' Why dont I go ahead and try Cellucor protein'. Cellucor products have never let me down and I am always more than satisfied (Super HD, C-4 Ripped, COR Performance ZMA, CLK and Alpha Amino). So I am used to the zero carb ISO-100 but this protein has very minimal fats and carbs which I found out are nice to have. This protein goes down smooth and mixes well with almond milk.  \n",
      "Great flavor and texture. Mixes easily. One of the best proteins that I have ever used!\n",

      "The cinnamon swirl is delicious \n",
      "I recently got back into a training routine and str****led to meet my protein needs. I typically don't like protein powders because they only taste good when you add bananas, strawberries and other fruits for flavor. However this protein powder is different it tastes amazing even if you just mix it with water alone. It leaved no clumps and smells great. I was able to smell it before I even opened the bottle. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Cinnamon swirl mixes great and tastes great, but its a little too sweet for me. Overall Great product. Molten chocolate is alright, its not the best chocolate flavor whey I've ever had, and takes a while to mix in a blender bottle to get all the chunks.\n",
      "Top tier whey protein, no taurine/glycine added in ingredient list.  Have tried 3 flavors and all were very good.  Mixes very well in blender ball shaker.  Will keep this as my go to whey powder from now on after trying a few other inferior products.\n",

      "I really wanted to like the Corfetti flavor, and eagerly awaited its arrival. Unfortunately it is just way too sweet--I tried toning it down by adding more almond milk but it really sticks to your tongue. I also tried protein pancakes as well hoping the other ingredients would tame the beast, but the cakey flavors gets masked and the sweetness still comes through. Interesting concept but alas, not my favorite. \n",
      "Great for a quick snack replacement at work or between meals on the weekend, The cinnamon Swirl flavor mixed with 2% milk is almost like having a milkshake  definitely my go to for Whey Protein. Nothing beats actuallu food for muscle gains but this helps with those snack cravings at  work or away from home.\n",
      "Mint Chocolate Chip is literally my favourite flavor. I've put it in milk, greek yogurt, and made cheesecake with it. Cinnamon swirl works well in pancakes, cinnamon rolls, and most baked goods. Smores has an almost fake-smores taste to it like a smores cereal or oreo would, but is by no means unappealing. Definitely the best protein I've had for macros and general taste/cost, even over ON.\n",
      "Lives up to the hype! I have tried this protein in Peanut Butter Marshmallow, Cor-Fetti Cake Batter, and Red Velvet Cake Batter. I cannot wait to try other flavors. The consistency is smooth (I mixed mine with water), it does not clump, and tastes amazing. I have used this protein in my oats and as the main ingredient in my pancake batter as well. This is a very versatile protein with excellent macronutrients! I love Syntha-6 protein powder for the taste but don't always care for the higher carbohydrate content. I love that this protein is just as flavorful with less than 1/3 of the carbs!\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE:\n",
      "I've tried a few more flavors... Smore's, Cinnamon Swirl, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Cookies N' Cream. I really love all of them. All of them are delicious on their own just mixed with water and the Cinnamon Swirl is amazing in my protein pancakes and waffles! I love this protein and highly recommend it!\n",
      "For me it's one of the best proteins in terms of flavor. I usually mix it with water or milk (I usually use Fairlife milk).\n",
      "A good protein powder. Mint flavor is something I'm having problems drinking. S'mores is good though.\n",
      "Tried this new brand of protein and it works great! Plus it's not that expensive, I got three different flavors (2lb's each) for 75$, plus it came with 30 servings of C4 free! Will be buying more protein from Cellucor in the future.\n",
      "Did they change the formulas? Is anyone else having a problem with them mixing really thin all of a sudden?\n",
      "\n",
      "Good flavors that rival BSN with not as many calories. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried the Whipped Vanilla and the Red Velvet Cake Batter and LOVED both. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and thought that it helped mute the over sweetness of the Red Velvet one and mixing Vanilla with frozen fruit was amazing. I also love that these shakes have kept me fuller much longer. I definitely plan on sticking to this brand!\n",
      "I absolutely love this protein.I have purchased a few different brands, and hands down this is my go to. The only one I dont love is the cor-fetti. The cinnamon one is my favourite - paired with unsweetened almond milk it tastes like a cinnamon bun. The peanut butter is great, as is the cookies and cream and mint chocolate chip. It mixes amazingly, no chunks, and definitely feels great after a workout. I am hooked - i still occasionally try other brands, but cellucor is my go to by far. Thanks cellucor!\n",
      "In love with this protein powder. Mixes well and easy to bake with! The red velvet cake batter flavour is amazing and I notice it's on clearance so I really hope they aren't planning on getting rid of it! :'( \n",
      "very thick once mixed, almost a slimy consistency, hard to swallow\n",
      "Dymatize was my main protein till I took a chance with this and so happy I did.  There's more flavors that I like and they're really good.  They mix well with water or milk.  I now look forward to that protein shake.  Mint chocolate chip really takes like it sounds as does the cinnamon swirl, tastes like a cinnamon bun.  The molten chocolate is my new desert.  And the peanut butter marshmallow is to die for.  How can protein be this tasty and so low fat/carb?\n",
      "One of the best protein lines I have tried, the tastes are very true to the flavor. Cinnamon swirl is best in hot meal (proats, pancakes), corfetti and mint chip in cheesecake/yogurt. Excellent macros as well. The other flavors raspberry truffle, cookie dough, and smores are also good (cookie dough and truffle being the best). I can only cellucor will come out with a peanut butter flavor or something with cheesecake. It would be amazing!\n",
      "This protein is excellent! The mixability is great, the flavor is on point, and its cheap! The Cor-Fetti was my  favorite. Didnt really enjoy the Molten Chocolate. Would buy this again.\n",
      "Great taste and great product!! My favorite protein ever !!\n",
      "Love the consistency of this protein. The red velvet flavor is a little too sweet for me but when I blend it with a half a banana, some raspberries, ice, greek yogurt, and almond milk, it makes a pretty good smoothie and it's more filling. Probably not going to go with red velvet again but will stick with this protein!\n",
      "Mixes excellent.  Great taste.  Great price.  Good profile\n",
      "It tastes just like a cinnamon roll! The flavor is intense and doesn't have any filler ingredients. Would definitely purchase again if the 4lb.'s are a buy one get one half off. \n",
      "One of my favorites! Absolutely love taking it after my workouts and it actually curbs my appetite a little longer! Definitely going to continue buying this product!!!\n",
      "this are the best protein ever and mix so well i love them!\n",
      "i ordererd this so many times :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I really love the way it the Whipped Vanilla mixes with my almond milk and frozen fruit all mixed in a blender. It is almost as I am eating a rich desert. This product mixes well with very little effort and the taste has you coming back for more. They have done a great job of low in calories, great taste, mixes well, and provides that high quality protein your body needs to grow. \n",
      "One of the best whey protein products out there!\n",
      "\n",
      "The label is pretty solid, and taste is great.\n",
      "Probably the best option for cooking and making stuff with whey\n",
      "Price is not the best, but you're paying for the quality of what you're getting\n",
      "Excellent protein. Flavor is spot on mixes ok depending on if you are using a shaker or blender. Price point cant be beat either.\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein is ok. I got the s'mores flavor which apparently is not being sold anymore. But it has chunks in it in order simulate graham crackers and marshmallows and I was not a huge fan of this as they usually stuck to the bottom of my shaker cup. It also mixes really awfully with milk. I tried to mix half a scoop with about 1.5 cups of milk and it just clumped up and stuck to the cup and my spoon. It tastes pretty good but the poor mixability just isn't worth it for me.\n",
      "I love Cellucor protein! My favorites are the Cinnamon Swirl, PB Marshmallow, and Whipped Vanilla. Not a fan of S'mores, Corfetti Cake Batter, or the Cookies & Cream. Trying the Red Velvet next!\n",
      "\n",
      "They mix well and bake well.\n",
      "Avoid the red velvet cake batter.  I think I got sold a bill of goods on this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall cellucor makes the best tasting whey I have had as a standalone whey product.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a die hard muscle milk fan until I tried this product and now I think I'm committed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, avoid the red velvet cake batter!  I would rather have red shoe string licorice flavor!\n",
      "outstanding mixabilty! I've never seen a protein powder like this can mix in just few seconds. good job cellucor.\n",
      "packaging and quality are among the best.\n",
      "results, lets just say mediocre! I had c4s before they didn't work too! but quality of their products I'm pretty sure are superb and this brand is trustworthy trust me.\n",
      "its taste (RVC) is not so much desirable but tolerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave this a 7 out of 10. I would give it more as it is probably the best tasting chocolate I have tried but it is to thick and clumps up in shaker\n",
      "I ordered  this after I finished my tub of syntha-6 which was great and blended well. Just thought I'd take advantage of the buy 2 get one free on cellucor.  Molten chocolate tasted great no issues with the flavor,  peanut butter marshmallow on the other hand got old and had to force it down (imho).  As far as mix ability,  I use soy milk since milk and I don't agree.  Well both flavors clumped up pretty bad when I used a shaker, wasn't as bad when I used a blender.  The bad with a blender is it got all frothy and foamy(not quite liquid?) it did blend well with water, as far as milk, my husband's had no lumps. Overall great protein to enjoy with milk or water. \n",
      "One of the best tasting proteins I've ever had. Doesn't mix as well as other brands but isn't terrible. I only purchased this because of a a buy one get one free deal, otherwise there are cheaper proteins that are just as good.\n",
      "Love this protein. Mixes well and flavor is great! Will definitely be ordering again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best protein powder I've had. I couldn't review the smores, but it's excellent, it has mini marshmallows and graham cracker bits. I highly recommend. The PB marshmallow tastes like a milkshake and is very good. The vanilla is good, but it has a little bit of an aftertaste \"bite.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "i originally ordered another flavor but they ran out I had no choice but to choose Cor-Fetti cake batter and was surprised how good it was . I have had my share of bad / ok and good tasting protein powders and this one is the very BEST ! I can't believe they discontinued the flavor . This stuff mixes well and is the perfect thickness . From now on this will be my brand of preference .\n",
      "This is a great protein for anyone who's on a budget and is starting in the fitness lifestyle. I still come to cellucor when I'm done with my higher end brand because they have many flavor options, they all taste pretty amazing and the deal is great. I do wish they had all the flavors from their main site here. \n",
      "Best tasting protein I've ever had. \n",
      "  Good ingredient list, mixes ok with shaker, no problem with blenders. Smore's tastes pretty good and not that sweet.   Would buy again.\n",
      "The cookies and Cream is delicious and it mixes well. the first day i got i left my shaker at home and stirred the powder in a cup and it mixed well. I'm amazed at the amount of protein per scoop vs others that take 2 scoops . I'm a fan I can wait to try the fun-fetti cake batter flavor!\n",
      "\n",
      "#beast mode\n",
      "Ordered the Red Velvet- tastes amazing (subjectively speaking). An almost-natural strawberry taste, moreso than Red Velvet flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Giving it a 10 for the flavor, and nutrient profile, and overall. However, would NOT mix with a spoon- so make sure you either blend it or use a shaker bottle. \n",
      "Absolutely love the flavor of this protein. I enjoy making various recipes that include protein powder and I love to add this product to it! Such fast shipping and excellent customer service every time I buy. I also received a sample of the BPI Best Creatine - snow cone flavor. I LOVED it and had an amazing workout after taking it. I immediately went home and bought 2 tubs! \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitley a good powder. It fits perfectly for my macros and tastes great. Kind of disappointed they discontinued S'mores, it was my favorite flavor. Strawberry Milkshake is a good runner up though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love everything about Cellucor whey! The flavors are amazing. I am not a shake drinker. I usually use my protein as a flavor for my nonfat plain greek yogurt. I also will bake with it occasionally. The macros are really great, and there's almost always a good deal on the powders here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I order from BB.com I always get my products within 24-48 hours. \n",
      "This is far and away my favorite protein.  Mixes well, tastes awesome, and has a cool looking bottle!  Im not sure if i like it so much because of the taste or because i am a big cellular fan, but i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great protein.\n",
      "Great taste. Mixes great. Great macros. Nuff said\n",
      "This protein powder tastes so yummy! I love it, and I even crave it. I've put on muscle since I've started using it. I've also been using the whipped vanilla and molten chocolate. Both were good as well! The molten chocolate tastes so good mixed with coffee and fat free milk. If you're a coffee drinker you should definitely try it!! Great taste, great results.\n",
      "Bought this based on user reviews of 9.1. First let me preface the following by mentioning that the biggest disappointment was the solubility; this is one the worst mixing proteins I've ever had. It doesn't  mix well and what does winds up very frothed. \n",
      "\n",
      "S'mores flavor is one of the highest rated, but I recommend avoiding it if you don't like very sweet flavored proteins. I know it's s'more flavored, you should expect sweet- this was rediculously sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Molten Chocolate and Chocolate Chip Mint had good flavor, but again, it's all for not if you have to scrape the walls of the mixer and rinse numerous times before you get it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very disappointed, will go back to ON and Dymatize proteins.\n",
      "I love the Cellucor proteins. I have yet to be disappointed by any of the flavors. Mix the s'mores with some almond milk and it's amazing.\n",
      "the taste wasn't bad at all but no one seems to think this protein is super thick, i just got it in 2 days ago and tried it last night, i couldnt get it down. on a scale of 1-10 on thickness is was about an 8. and people also say its smooth i have a protein blender that i use not a shaker bottle and it came out super lumpy! i dont know if its this specific flavor or what but im moving on the optimum nutrition protein! \n",
      "I have tried a wide variety of Cellucor's  whey and even pre-workout sups and so far I have been really impressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The COR-Fetti- I seriously had this in my shopping cart for a month debating back and forth if i should pull the trigger (aka, input my Credit Card # lol) Gladly I decided to take the leap and am so happy to say I was far from disappointed. Cellucore put REAL sprinkle like fetti in the powder! If you're not a fan of delicious confetti cake than you won't like this. If you are then by ALLLLL means do it! I personally love making COR-fetti protein pancakes .... so GOOD!\n",
      "\n",
      "The S'mores- This was another whey powder that sat in the shopping cart for awhile. I'm pretty much a sucker for anything smores related. (I'm a chocoholic) but the thought of committing to smores for 2lbs was a bit more of a commitment than i was willing to take. But someone once wise once told me, \"STFU make gains\" and then i remembered that I DO in fact love smores so i decided to go for it . YOLO? lol Well the Smore's did not disappoint. It was delicious! Probably not a flavor i would have everyday but i love baking with it and switching it up so overall I'm happy. Plus i owe cellucor a huge high five on putting in itty bitty pieces of smores crunch. like really!? Cellucor, You're the real MVP.\n",
      "\n",
      "C4- Okay, This **** works. Bottom line. If you want to feel like you took some serious pre workout this is it. On the other hand, if you're like me and don't like to feel like a crack head during your workout ease yourself into it. Take HALF a scoop and adjust accondignly to your tolerance level. I personally like blending my c4 with crushed ice and a little bit of water to make a slushie.. yeah I'm kinda of a kid at heart.\n",
      "i absolutely LOVE this protein!! it is my absolute favorite! completely smooth. no lumps or weird aftertaste. it is truly DELICIOUS. i use whipped vanilla by itself OR as a great ''base'' when i do different shakes... i recommend it to ALL of my friends!! there hasn't been one flavor yet that i haven't loved!! \n",
      "Love all of these flavors!!!! \n",
      "I can't do without my protein.  Best tasting so far.  its so hard when I don't have enough money to get it, but I always stretch it out because I can't go without.\n",
      "Mixes great. Never had any trouble. Not too heavy. I have a fairly sensitive stomach and this is really, what's the word, gentle(?) on my stomach. Also the s'mores... 3 words: Mini Friggin Marshmallows. Delicious. \n",
      "I find this powder does not mix very well at all. The molten chocolate tastes amazing! I did not enjoy the cinnamon swirl on its own but tasted great when adding it to pancakes! \n",
      "Amazing gainz and amazing taste!\n",
      "The best tasting protien powder by far, oh yeah and it works too!\n",
      "This protein powder was recommended to me by an online coach and so far its the BEST I have ever tasted. Mixes well and into a very smooth silky texture, not to mention the whipped vanilla flavor is DELICIOUS! I swear I look forward to drinking it everyday and it always leaves me feeling like I want more lol. Its likea liquid dessert. I also tried the cinnamon swirl but that was a little too sweet for my personal taste and not sure I could drink it everyday. Vanilla it is for me =P\n",
      "These protein shakes are absolutely delicious! And it mixes perfectly without any lumps left behind. It works well for me and helps with recovery after long hard weight training. I definitely recommend it. Best protein shake I've ever tasted!\n",
      "Great tasting protein !! :)\n",
      "Didn't like the cinnaom swirl flavor.\n",
      "I decided to give COR-formance a try because it was BOGO 50% off.   I got the Whipped Vanilla and the Cinnamon Swirl.  So far, I have used the Whipped Vanilla and it's pretty good.  It's easy to shake up and the flavor is pretty good.  Also, I don't know if it was just coincidence but as soon as I opened it up, I didn't need to search for the scoop!  It was right on top with a scoop filled in it.  That's awesome right there.   I'll have to see if the cinnamon swirl is the same.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This is by far one of the best tasting protein powders I have ever tried. Cinnamon Swirl is a unique and phenomenal flavor. The nutritional profile is great with 25g protein, 4g net carbs, 1.5g carbs and 130 calories per serving. I felt no gastrointestinal issues while on this product. \n",
      "I wanted to try something new, but this brand is too sweet for my taste.  I never use sugar in anything and this tastes like it's loaded with it for some reason.  The S'mores and vanilla do taste good aside from that and they also mix well.  Wouldn't buy again.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best whey protein powders I have ever had. I have tried most of the flavors and they all taste great, imo. It mixes up very good as well. The price is great too, if you you get the stacked saving bundle ( 3 2Ib tubs of protein and 1 30serv. of C4 for under 80 dollars! ). You can't go wrong with this protein. \n",
      "It doesn't taste like cinnamon in any way. The flavor is very, very sweet and sugary. If your favorite part of a cinnamon bun is the icing on top and you like extra icing, then you'll like this. If you think \"cinnamon swirl\" should have at least a hint of cinnamon flavor, you'll be disappointed.\n",
      "The price is right. The added digestive enzymes are great on the stomach, and the FLAVOUR is the BEST I've ever had in a protein shake! It is actually enjoyable to drink!\n",
      "Taste is amazing, blends well. Heat this up a little and it will taste just like hot chocolate.\n",
      "I was a pretty religious MusclePharm user until I got my hands on this stuff. The Red Velvet Cake Batter flavor is absolutely the most delicious protein I've ever had, and thats why I gave it a 10. It tastes amazing and mixes extremely well, what more could you want?\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the cinnamon swirl, it isn't too far behind. The taste is pretty delicious as well and I'd say identical to Cinnamon Toast Crunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This flavor is my new favorite! I mix it with some unsweetened vanilla almond milk and it tastes just like  a mint chocolate chip milk shake! :)\n",
      "The Cinnamon Swirl Cellucor Whey Protein is my go-to whey. I LOVE the taste and the fact that it has BCAAs in the powder. Other flavors I have tried include COR-Fetti Cake Batter, Red Velvet Cake Batter, and Peanut Butter Marshmallow. These were all tasty, but not nearly as good as the Cinnamon Swirl. But remember: to each his/her own, so my favorite flavor may not be the same as yours. Cellucor makes a ton of great protein powders, so you can't go wrong with the brand. Find your favorite flavor and check out Cellucor's recipes online for protein-filled snacks!\n",
      "I was hoping for a cake batter flavor and this is not it!  COR-Fetti Cake Batter doesn't taste like cake batter at all.  It has a fruity flavor and is too sweet.  I am going to mix it with Muscle Milk Banana Cream to get through the container of Cor-Fetti Cake Batter.  I may still order one of the other flavors of Cellucor.  I have not yet determined the effectiveness of this particular whey protein powder.  I bought it for the level of grams of protein that is suppose to have. I do not like the texture of Cellucor, but may stick with it.  I am not sure at this time.\n",
      "This stuff is AWESOME! The flavors are spot-on and affordable.  It can be used in recipes to add a protein boost or as a post work-out shake. I like to put it in my pancake batter, overnight oats, and muffin recipes. Cellucor protein makes me WANT to bake healthy treats and snacks! \n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE this whey. It doesn't have the weird protein aftertaste some other brands do. They taste AMAZING but only have 1g of sugar ( how?!?) I drink them with water or almond milk. They are amazing in recipes ( I love making protein waffles) everyone that has told me they don't like protein powder taste has been pleasantly surprised then bought it.\n",
      "To me, the taste is a big thing. And this protein lacks it. The smell is deceiving. Smells just like regular peanut butter, but then when you actually taste it, it is just bad. \n",
      "I bought the COR-Fetti cake batter and the cinnamon swirl a while back but I tried them and I ended up giving them away because they both were way too sweet! They tasted just like they said they would taste but it was way too much for me. The cinnamon swirl is very good but like I said way too sweet, I think it taste like cinnamon toast crunch. So after those two i decided to give the whey another try after i saw there was a buy one get one 50% off sale. I got the mint chocolate chip and the strawberry (I haven't tried the strawberry yet), the mint chocolate chip is amazing. It wasn't too sweet and taste just like it says. I was kind of hesitant when I first opened it, it has a really bad artificial chocolate smell and thought it would taste how it smells like whey normally does. \n",
      "I really hate both cor-fetti and the cookies n cream flavors. While the cor-fetti smells amazing, both have that bitter, chemical taste I can't tolerate. Plus, it mixes up to this slimy texture rather than the thick creamy texture other proteins give me. Also pretty clumpy. That said, I have had some success cooking with this protein and end up with a protein pancake with some great macros and pretty good flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Súper good \n",
      "Awesome protein powder overall! Favorite flavors are cinnamon swirl and peanut butter marshmallow. S'mores is awful. The marshmallows are hard and taste terrible. Would probably taste better without them. Red velvet and cor-fetti are spot on. Can't really go wrong with this product \n",
      "The protein powder tastes good and mixes really well.   I can't wait to try other flavors.  It is a good price for the buck. \n",
      "Awesome flavor, great profile, and pretty short ingredient list.  Just wish bb.com sold the 7 serving packets so I can try some of the other flavors without committing to a 2lb tub, as this stuff isn't the cheapest on the market.  However, I'll definitely be repurchasing the flavors I've tried so far.\n",
      "I love this protein. The taste is great. The mint chocolate chip tastes amazing! The vanilla taste is ****ght.\n",
      "Amazing taste! I bought two flavors Smores and Cinnamon Swirl, both flavors are delicious and mixing and taste very well with water. If I use a blender the consistency is like an Ice Cream. I'm a Bodyfitness competitor and a WheyProtein that taste absolutely good in water is essential for my contest preparation. I Love It.\n",
      "\n",
      "all flavors ive tried are awesome , when It came to the cake batter I only liked it in baking/cooking ect. example: mix in oatmeal or in pudding , but not by itself in shake \n",

      "\n",
      "Cinnamon swirl , s'mores  and cor-fetti cake batter are my favorite !!!! I am so afraid to order other flavors because I can't get enough of these ! The cake batter flavor is great for baking .. I mixed cake batter with pineapples , unsweetened vanilla almond milk and greek yogurt and it literally taste like a piña colada ! I can't wait for summer days and add some rum to my protein shakes haha ! But all jokes aside .. This protein is the best !!! Arrives so fast and the taste is out of this world .. I look forward to breakfast when I know I'm having cinnamon swirl pancakes !!!! Or smores with banana yummmmm \n",
      "This protein powder have nice trusted Nutrition Facts (I saw the lab tests over the web) and it also tastes good. I like the Red Velvet Cake Batter more than the Peanut Butter Marshmallow. the Peanut Butter Marshmallow is unsweetened enough for my opinion, I also like the texture of this powder, it's a bit thick so it have texture like a milkshake even if you mix it with water !\n",
      "most of the time it shakes pretty well but sometimes it's not and leaves some chunks after it.\n",
      "I mostly use it for Oatmeals and Pancakes, it gives it a nice texture and also a nice taste !\n",
      "well after all, I still will recommend it maybe i'll try other flavors in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has to be by far the best tasting Whey I have ever purchased.  My protein shakes taste like desserts!!!  With low sugar and a good price, I think this brand will be my #1 go to for protein powder!  \n",
      "Best tasting chocolate protein I've had. This literally tastes like Molten Chocolate. Plus the macros are really good.\n",
      "Peanut Butter Marshmallow is a must!!! Grab this mess and I promise you won't want another kind of protein ever again.\n",
      "This protein is great.  It mixes well, and tastes amazing!\n",
      " With this and my other supplements, I gained 10 pounds of muscle in 5 weeks.\n",
      "I will be buying again. \n",
      "This stuff is amazing! The chocolate really satisfies my sweet tooth.\n",
      "Thi is one of muly favorite protein powder, blends well in any luiquid, the vanilla flavor is my gavorite, great flavor! It taste like a milkshake!\n",
      "This product has a great taste and blends really well. It keeps me full without the bloat and stomach issues that some whey proteins have given me in the past. I think the only down side is the sucralose...but it is one of the last ingredients.\n",
      "Ok so I think the other reviews here already speak to the quality and overall excellence of this product so this review is specifically for the s'mores flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is INCREDIBLE. My girlfriend and I fight over it and have to ration the servings so we don't eat it all in one week. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the best flavor of whey protein I have ever tried (20+ brands/flavors tried). Hands down excellent.\n",

      "I purchased some of Cellucor's protein through a stack in the Fall and it was an interesting buy to say the least. The range of flavors with this protein is immense, but hear me out when I say they are not home runs. I've tried different brands and there is something about this protein that leaves an odd after taste in your mouth, I even mixed some of them with milk and it was even more strange. I found that the Peanut Butter Marshmallow clumped up a lot too, which was very disappointing. Not to mention the dollar value, 4 pounds for $50 is a little steep. Flavor wise it was very mixed, I received four or five free 5 servings samples free with a 2 pound tub because I wanted to try as many as possible. I was blown away by the Molten Chocolate, it tastes different than every other chocolate I've had and it was delicious. The Mint Chocolate Chip, Cinnamon Swirl and Strawberry Milkshake came in for second, everything else was either sub par or nasty. Most notably the Cake Batter, I thought it would taste awesome but it just tasted like butter. I don't see myself buying this protein again, however it was definitely a unique experience trying all the flavors.\n",
      "I've only been lifting for about 4 years, and I've tried many different types and brands of protein powders as many beginners do. With that being said, I truly believe I have finally found my go-to protein powder! This stuff is a great all around product. It mixes wonderfully with both milk and water. It has no bloating, gas, or hard stomach effects as sooo many other protein powders do! And tastes very good! My only critical comment would be that the peanut butter marshmallow flavor tastes more like marshmallow than the peanut butter but it still tastes amazing. I would deffinately recommend this product to anyone having a hard time finding a protein powder to stick with!!\n",
      "my fav protein, not too sweet and the flavor is amazing even with just water.\n",
      "One of my favorite proteins of all time!! It tastes great and it mixes very well. So far I've tried both Molten Chocolate, Cinnamon Swirl, and Peanut Butter Marshmallow. Molten Chocolate and Cinnamon Swirl taste so freaking amazing, but the Peanut Butter Marshmallow does not taste good at all, in my opinion. I also trust this product because there is no amino spiking and you will get everything that is listed on the nutrition label. If you want a high quality protein powder with great flavors, I would highly suggest you get your hands on Cellucor COR-Performance Whey!!!!\n",
      "My family loves the cinnamon Swirl!!! We use it to make protein pancakes and I use it for my post workouts!! \n",
      "First off shout out BB for sending my stuff so fast, picked standard and my stuff come literally 12 hours later. The flavors are good, mint choc chip in my nutribullet and a little ice made a nice milkshake. Cinnamon swirl is my breakfast most days. All in all very satisfied.\n",
      "This is a good product with an excellent nutrient profile.  The value is quite good.  ON Gold Standard whey is just too good to beat though, so I'd rate this just under that.  The cinnamon swirl is quite good tasting, but the molten chocolate is only ****ght and leaves me wishing I had some ON extreme milk chocolate instead.  Overall though it really is a good product, and if you are looking to switch it up to try something you haven't before, I say give it a try.\n",
      "Favorite three flavors are chocolate, cinnamon, & peanut butter!\n",
      "Mix them all together in a smoothie, or even add to your healthy meals for cooking!\n",
      "Great for cravings for those who are competitors on stage, & best savings on the stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommended to those who are using 100% Whey Protein Isolate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**I put one scoop of Molten Chocolate or Cinnamon Swirl in my black coffee every morning.   \n",
      "The taste is amazing and it mixes well unlike other protein's I've tried. No clumps are a huge plus for me! :)\n",
      "Mint Chocolate--yellow colored with the mint green colored dots around, Definitely tastes as it states! tastes great when baking with. Perfer to take this with almond milk but its not so bad with just water.\n",
      "\n",
      "PB Marsh-- literally taste the texture of the marshmallows. Didn't quite meet my Peanutbutter expectations but its not bad at all, enjoy this with my oats and milk instead of water.\n",
      "I have nothing bad to say about this product or flavor. I bought my boyfriend this flavor for Christmas and for someone who hates the flavor of protein he enjoyed this. As for me, I loved it so much I had to buy my own tube. Tastes AMAZING alone, mixes well with water or milk and even better in pancakes or anything else. If you have a sweet tooth this is the go to flavor.\n",
      "The only whey protein I use. Seems to work great for my body type! No toilet runs = WIN. Nothing beats a cinnamon swirl+milk+oats mix early in the morning!!!\n",
      "The macros are great. The taste is okay. It's not horrible and I can drink it but I was expecting more from it. I would still recommend it to anyone that wants to try it.\n",
      "The taste... is unbearable. Immediately opening the tub an odor of fake plastic punched me right in the face. It doesn't stop there. When you try to drink it, you're reminded of the broken nose you just received and then it's like each molecule of protein is punching your taste buds and throat as you try to ingest this. \n",
      "\n",
      "The stats are good, and were great for the price. I'm a huge fan of Cellucor's products, as they have a great performance and quality record. However, just don't get this flavor protein. Or you may end up taking your anger out on the new kid curling in the squat rack :( \n",
      "Now the taste is AMAZING I have never had such a good tasting protein powder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I take it  once in the morning to help me stay full throughout the day and once after im done weight lifting. After taking my nasty pre workouts this is a favorite part of my post workout. Now does it work well Its protein powder. Cant go wrong by getting this product\n",
      "Good product, I think it's best to put less water (6oz) than desired to really bring out the flavor. The S'mores had hard little marshmallows that sink to the bottom, I think it would have been best if they were smashed into small pieces by default. Overall Molten Chocolate and S'mores are great. Some minor complaint is this protein is one of the worst in mixability, there's so many clumps if you stir it in a glass cup with a spoon even if you try to stir fast like I always have to do. It's best to use a shaker cup or blender bottle. Another complaint is no glutamine in it like most other protein powders, but it can also be a good thing because there's less fillers in every serving so you're getting most protein. As far as progress, well it's whey protein, so there's not much to say. Would buy again if it was on sale.\n",
      "I ordered (4) 2lb. tubs of Cellucor Whey when they were on sale for buy one get one half off and I can say it was worth every penny. I ordered 4 flavors, Red Velvet, Cor-fetti, Cinnamon Swirl, and Peanut Butter Marshmallow. Shockingly my favorite was the Peanut Butter Marshmallow which seems to be a pretty mundane flavor and overdone but Cellucor definitely did this one right; I may order 4 of just that flavor on my next order. This is by far the best protein I've had and I actually look forward to it after every workout!\n",
      "This is my absolute FAVORITE protein.  The S'mores, Red Velvet, and Mint Chocolate Chip are amazing.  They are perfect for contest prep - it takes care of my cravings for sweets.  Sometimes I blend light soy milk with cellucor protein and stick it in the fridge for an hour.  Pure bliss!\n",
      "I love this protein.  The cinnamon swirl flavor  is amazing and tastes great when mixed with my coffee in the morning.\n",
      "Best tasting protien ive gotten yet! Flavor is perfect, exactly like the ice cream! Love the protien content per serving. Only thing i didnt like was half of it was air. But all the serving amounts were there, so no complaints really!! Definitly worth the purchase! \n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried several proteins and many make my gassy and looking for a seat on some porcelain.  I have had no GI issues with this one at all, the taste is great and very smooth to mix in a cheap shaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both me and my husband love this protein powder. Mixes great and tastes amazing. I love adding the cinnamon swirl flavor to my morning coffee. \n",
      "I bought two of these having never tried Cellucor products before. I must say I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and mixing ability of this protein. Very happy with my purchase and will be buying again!\n",
      "Pleasantly surprised by this protein. Tastes great, low carb, has a high amount of protein. Great texture, mixes very well. I've made it in coffee, water, almond milk, and have baked with it and it was great in everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl is my favorite, it smells great and has a strong cinnamon taste, but it IS sweet. My boyfriend thinks it is way too sweet, so if sweet is not your thing, you may want to look elsewhere. Also, it gets extremely foamy. I mixed it in about 10oz of water in a 24oz shaker and when I was done, my shaker was over half filled with foam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chocolate is okay. Not as sweet as the Cinnamon Swirl, but still good. It's got a pretty average chocolate protein flavor, nothing outstanding. No issues with foaming.\n",
      "I am loving this protein! The best tasting protein I have had! Also like the fact that it doesn't upset my stomach like most proteins. Favorite flavor is the Mint Chocolate Chip so far. Tastes exactly like a milkshake it's so delicious! Just ordered the cinnamon swirl since the flavor ratings were the highest :)\n",
      "I really enjoy the protein powder from Cellucor. Some of the best tasting protein powder I have tried. The mint chocolate chip is the worst flavor I have tried, I will not buy it again. The cinnamon swirl is really good and mixed well with coffee and all natural peanut butter. The s'mores flavor is what I usually use when I make a peanut butter and protein powder dip with almonds and banana pudding dip for apples. Its a really tasty dip that you can make into balls coating with oats and almonds or just as a dip. \n",
      "This flavor is toooo good! Blend it up with ice post-workout and it tastes like a legitimate milkshake. 100% ordering this one again once I'm out of my current protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt this is the best whey protein supplement available in market right now... bought stack (3 jars of diff flavours) of them with Pre Workout C4.. I'm using second jar which is Cookies N' Cream and i love Cookies N' cream flavour over Cinnamon Swirl..... recommended to all fellas..... would buy it again \n",
      "This is my go-to whey protein for yummy TASTE!  Of the flavors I have tried, my favorite in order are: S'mores, COR-fetti, & Peanut Butter Marshmallow.  The S'mores is so amazing because it has bits of s'mores grahams and marshmallow bits in it!  It creates such a surprising element to your protein shake with water that makes your taste buds dance in your mouth!  Try Cellucor Cor-Performance Whey once, and watch out- you will be HOOKED!  :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Best tasting whey I've ever had. Effects. Proteins protein to be honest so it's nothing fancy.\n",
      "Oh my gosh!!!! These are the best flavors I've ever had in a protein shake. It's like dessert twice a day!\n",
      "They are also great for making protein donuts! :)\n",
      "Some of the best tasting whey I've ever had! Only had it a few weeks so will update eventually with results.\n",
      "Ok, I just finished cycling off my last tub of Phase 8; so I heard some good reviews and wanted to give Cellucor Whey Protein a try. I must admit I was very surprised. It mixes well with water and the taste is great; with the added benefit of having high protein count and low fats and carbs. I believe this product will be a staple in my workout supplements.\n",
      "I purchased three tubs of the Cellucor performance whey in three different flavors. Molten chocolate, red velvet, and the s'mores. By far the s'mores was my favorite. The red velvet was okay and I did NOT like the molten chocolate which was disappointing since chocolate is usually a safe choice.  It did it's job in supplying protein for me. Nothing special though.\n",
      "Simply put, this is a solid protein shake. All of the flavors have been amazing, especially the cinnamon swirl, and my recovery has been great. The product does exactly what it says it will do. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I do have one small complaint. I don't know if it's because of the artificial sweeteners or the digestive enzyme, but this protein shake can give you some small digestive problems \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes well :) provides a good amount of Protein.\n",
      "Bought a Mint Choco Chip flavored one, it's too much minty. But it is drinkable. Awesome product.\n",
      "Great mixability, especially with ~1:3 milk:water ratio (to save money on overusing milk while still thickening the shake up nicely). The Velvet cake had an odd aftertaste I didn't dig. Strawberry Milkshake is decent-solid. The Peanut Butter Marshmallow was about as good as it gets. \n",
      "No one here comments on what it did for their body, only just taste and mixability. Sadly, I'm an ectomorph, so am still searching for the right combo and quantities of protein, calories, etc that will give me gains. So, I can't comment on this product in/of itself as far as getting tangible gains from it, since I was taking casein and post-lift bars at the same time...and still didn't gain a lot! Argh. That said, mixes well and goes down easy.   \n",
      "i ordered a tub a few days ago and this stuff tastes really good. drinking it with water is nice also with some milk has a nice flavour. i also add this to my waffle and pancake mix and its awesome. love it, just ordered mint chocolate chip and cinnamon swirl lets see how those go but cant go wrong with these. after having most proteinjs its nice to change it up once in a while and its worth the price.\n",
      "S'mores is by far the best tasting whey I ha ever tried. Needs a little help in the blending department but flavor is spot on!\n",
      "I have to say that after trying a LOT of different proteins and flavours that I really like this one - blends nearly instantly, has a great mouth feel and its really like drinking a piece of red velvet cake, definitely helpful when trying to curb cravings! \n",
      "That said, i can taste a SLIGHT bit of the sweetener but I really appreciate this one. I've tried a few other flavours from Cellucor and think I've found my go to brand.\n",
      "The taste is very artificial. It is also a bit richer than I would like. Doesn't mix very well either. Definitely won't buy again\n",
      "I like the little chocolate flakes in the shaker, makes it look like real melted mint chocolate chip ice cream!  Tastes fantastic and smells great too, no weird chemical smell like ON Whey...\n",
      "The taste is a 10/10 , by far the best tasting protein on the market . However, I had issues mixing it with milk, even skim milk.  There would be some chunks that didn't mix but they were small chunks , so really not a big deal at all. I prefer this over ON protein. Their protein mixed better but their taste was not even close. \n",
      "So freaking good! My favorite way to use this protein is adding it to my oatmeal or pancakes! perfect flavor, fantastic smell. I love cellucor!\n",
      "Fantastic product. Mixes well with everything and tastes fantastic. I'm a HUGE fan of the ingredient list being comprised solely of Protein. Flavoring, and NOTHING ELSE.  Definitely worth the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucor have to worst flavour, this protein is also over price,\n",
      "\n",
      "that is why I am giving it a 7\n",
      "I have mixed feelings about this protein, I usually go with ON and last time I tried GNC advanced AMP. I wanted to try this because a friend suggested it, up on initially opening the s'mores it actually smelled like a s'more but up on putting it in the blender bottle with the suggested amount of milk the whole shake turned into foam. Like I told the BB.com rep I realize this happens but it generally dissolves in a couple of seconds. With this protein it took about 30min before the foam went away. After I got to drink the protein I was really impressed that the flavor was still there and it had marshmallow in it which was cool. I would say if you are going to spend 40 or 50 dollars go with ON.\n",
      "Cor Performance Whey is by far my favorite all around whey protein to go to. Not only are the abundance of flavors amazing, the quality is of the best you can find. There are no added Single Amino Acids, in other words, cellucor doesn't amino spike their protein so you're getting every gram that it says you are. My favorite flavors by far are cookies&cream, vanilla, red velvet, and cinnamon swirl. Definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for Quality and a GREAT TASTING whey protein product. It is very easy to mix, no chunking or clumping. It is very reasonably priced as well, and usually you can find great BOGO deals on it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't tried too many different protein powder brands but this by far is the best and makes me not want to even try any others! I got three different flavors (buy 2 get 1 free special) The molten chocolate is amazing. It tastes like hot chocolate in shake form. (I use 1 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk) the PB Marshmallow tastes like you are drinking tagalong girl scout cookies (in a really good way) And the cinnamon swirl is good but may be a little too vanilla-ish for me. I would recommend any of these flavors! I can't wait to buy 3 more!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "So i've had every flavor of cellucor thanks to all the sample bags and these 3 are definitely my top picks! i have a serving or two daily and pre-workout or post-workout these are absolutely amazing! All flavors are spot on, they mix in oats, greek yogurt, water, milk, ect... perfectly! i have had bad experiences with proteins and digestion but these have given no problems! highly recommend to anybody! \n",
      "I Love Cellucor and this deal. I am ordering my second stack right now. I especially love s'mores so I am getting them again.\n",
      "Really liked this stuff. I am trying to gain weight and it has been doing the job nicely. Unfortunately, I am lactose intolerant so I won't be getting it anymore. But for those who can tolerate whey, I highly recommend this stuff. It mixes really well with a variety of things. Sometimes I would just add water and I could drink it easily, tasted fine just like that. Other times I made a shake with the protein powder, soy milk, frozen banana and peanut butter and it tasted like a dessert. Loved it.\n",
      "I have tried several brands and flavors trying to find the right one or select few that have the taste, consistency, and overall attributes you expect in a whey protein.  This isn't a small purchase.  After years of expensive trial and error, I've found COR Performance Whey to meet my expectations.  I have four or five different flavors in the house now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavours were interesting (smelled amazing), but I couldn't say it was super-awesome. My boyfriend (who tried a lot of different whey companies in the past) said the Red Velvet cake from this company was the best he's ever had. \n",
      "I will re-order Red Velvet cake in the future for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked the Cor-fetti cake batter, but not enough to re-order. The cake sprinkles got annoying after a while. \n",
      "\n",
      "Strawberry was a struggle to finish. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just re-ordered more in different flavours to try. I cannot wait for them to arrive.\n",
      "Cinnamon swirl and red velvet taste great when mixed together, but the red velvet is not good on its own. Cinnamon swirl is great for baking and mixing into oats, as well as drinking it on its own. Both mix well into water. Overall I would recommend this brand, just not red velvet. \n",
      "I love this protein!! Fantastic taste with high protein and low carbs. The flavors are the best I have ever had from a protein. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't mean to be indelicate but this stuff tastes terrible.  Way too sweet.  Also, it's very difficult to get it to dissolve in water.\n",
      "Overall a great protein! Low calorie, low carb, and 25g protein! I've tried three flavors. Was a lil disappointed by the peanut butter marshmallow, just wasnt that great tasting. The mint chocolate chip though was AMAZING! Def gonna be trying that one again soon! \n",
      "To be honest theres kind of a bitter taste to each flavor, and it really doesn't mix good but overall its a solid protein\n",
      "I have been using this product for over a year now.  Honestly, through the past 15 years I've tried hundreds of protein flavors with various manufactures.  This one is by far the best out there.  I have tried most of their flavors, but molten chocolate is my favorite!!!!!!! Even the red velvet cake batter is better than i thought it would be.  The protein mix isn't heavy on your stomach.  So, you can (or I do) while walking into the gym and you won't or shouldn't feel bloated.  Again, I use this protein 'RELIGIOUSLY'!!!!!!!!  100% RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT\n",
      "Overall, I tried the cinnamon Cwirl flavor (which kind of was okish).\n",
      "Mint chocolate chip was the next flavor I tried and I have to say I am addicted. It taste like actual ice cream. \n",
      "Love love love Cellucor proteins!!!  Cake batter is my favorite!  \n",
      "The Mint Chocolate is awesome and I'm not even a fan of mint chocolates. The S'mores had terrible mixability which I had not similar experience with other Cellucor Whey -- the clumps would only dissolve in a blender. Perhaps a bad batch of S'mores? I'm not going to risk ordering another tub to find that out.\n",
      "It's got the macros i expect, so i can use it in place of other protein powders i normally buy, like Protogen, or Phase8.  The flavors are great though.  My wife is very particular about the taste, and she has loved both of these flavors.  I'm buying them again next month!\n",
      "Great tasting protein, mixes great. Gonna try mixing it into oatmeal or pancakes, think the cinnamon flavor would be perfect addition. \n",
      "My favorite protein always reorder\n",
      "I enjoyed using Cellucor Whey it was Smooth and easily mixed.  Has a good mix of vitamins and protein that didnt upset my stomach at all, would say a high quality product.  Pricey but when on sale its a great buy.  If considering you cant go wrong. \n",
      "I like it, it has pretty good taste even though I added more cinnamon to mine each time I took it.  Did a lot of research before going ahead a pulling the trigger on this one. One of the more cleaner proteins out there without tasting like pure garbage. And the amount of protein per scoop is valid enough for me to keep taking. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this while it was on sale and I am so glad that I gave Cellucor's whey protein a try.  I've been buying Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard whey and Gaspari Nutrition Myofusion for years and, while I have enjoyed those, I have to say that this is without a doubt my favorite protein.  The Molten Chocolate tastes exactly like a shake from Wendy's.  The Mint Chocolate Chip tastes like an Andes Mint (may be a bit strong for some but it's definitely not bad), and the Cinnamon Swirl is the first whey protein powder that my wife has approved of and committed to taking.\n",
      "Love this protein.  I have tried C Swirl, Red V, Peanut M, and Chocolate M.  Each flavor tastes great with red v and choc. being my favs.  Great macros and a high quality protein that recommend. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are on the fence, get it. You won't regret it.\n",
      "Cellucor is my favorite protein powder I've tried so far. I've previously purchased protein products from BBcom's foundation series, Dymatize, EAS, and Six Star Nutrition... all of which I really didn't like. I've bought Cellucor's molten chocolate flavor multiple times just because it's the most versatile flavor in my opinion. I've also tried Red Velvet (DELICIOUS!) and Cinnamon Swirl (Also pretty good.) I use my protein powder to mix into my morning coffee, add to oatmeal, bake cookies and add to fruit smoothies. Overall pretty great mixability, except when I add it to my coffee it takes a while to get it to where there is no clumps. Great flavor, and good price considering the overall quality of the product.\n",
      "I highly recommend this product.  The flavor is great and I have gained 10 pounds of muscle since I started using the product in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "My go to protein when I can afford it. My biceps have gained an inch using this protein! The cake batter is excellent, but the cookies n cream isn't too great. I refer to it as spicy poo poo, honestly, because it has a strange spice towards the end of it. All joking aside, the CELLUCOR WHEY is one of the best proteins out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know why everyone is raving about the Cinnamon Swirl flavor.  It is pretty rough to drink.  Like a generic vanilla protein with a cinnamon aftertaste, plus it doesn't fully mix in my shaker.  Everytime I leave ON protein for something eye catching I always regret it and wind up ordering from them again.  Cellucor has a great pre workout supplement (C-4) that I stand by, but they should stay away from Protein until they can improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was excited to try this protein powder initially because I had heard so many positive views of it. Most people love it. However, I did not like this protein powder. In my blender bottle (you should probably use a blender instead) it did not mix well. It was still powdery and gritty. The flavor peanut butter marshmallow tasted overly sweet and artificial. I was disappointed. On the plus side, they have a lot of flavors to choose from so perhaps I just need to try another flavor. The shipping was quick and the amount you get for the price is worth it. \n",
      "This is exclusively terrible, love the product in vanilla but this s'mores flavor does not mix well. It almost taste like their are actual crunchy pieces of cracker in it. Not sure how everyone else feels about crunchy chunks in your protein shake,but i am not a fan. Would give this product an 8 or 9 for the vanilla flavor\n",
      "I really do enjoy this product!  I own every flavor of COR-Performance Whey.  The flavors are great, they mix well, and some of the flavors are even great to use for baking.  During my competition prep, I had cravings from time to time.  So to curb my cravings, I would pick the flavor(s) that came closest to what I wanted.  [Reese's PB Cup: 1/2 Molten Chocolate and 1/2 PB Marshmallow. Oreos: Cookies n Cream.]  There's nothing better than getting in some extra protein than with a great tasting protein drink, and Cellucor provides a great powder!\n",
      "\n",
      "We buy the peanut butter marshmallow and we love it. This is by far the best product that we have tried so far that taste great and gives us the best recovery after a workout like body beast. I would highly recommend it to anyone lifting heavy.\n",
      "I'll start with taste.  Cinnamon was incredible!  Especially when mixed with chocolate milk IMO.  Cake batter was fun to look at because of the sprinkles, and didn't taste bad.  But didn't taste much like cake batter to me, just tasted sweet.  Same with red velvet.  Tasted sweet but nothing distinct.  The scoop seemed a lot bigger than other brands with the same amount of protein, so I can't help but wonder if there is some fillers?  I noticed there was some clumps when using a shaker but otherwise I would consider purchasing this again.  Gonna try a few other brands before I do that though\n",
      "All flavors of this product taste amazing. I make protein waffles and pancakes at least once a day mixed with cottage cheese to make them fluffy and soft. The product does not clump. It's thick so shakes always turn out good. I've noticed that I stay full longer when using cellucor protein. Helps me meet my macros while feeling like I'm cheating. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love love love this red velvet flavor!! I use this whey protein to make egg white pancakes every morning. Almond milk and the powder with an egg white then bing bam boom you have amazingly great tasting fluffy pancakes. Ahh, like sent from gods. Also bakes up around chicken easily. Basically this protein is an amazing flavor and consistency (not at all grainy or textured, becomes very smooth) for someone who likes to be creative when cooking/baking with protein powders. I've recently tried other whey proteins when this one started to run out and none of them have baked/cooked nearly as nicely. Really disappointed I spent the money on the others, I should've just bought this again. \n",
      "Tastes amazing, so many flavor options, great for baking or just drinking in a plain shake!\n",
      "This is a great tasting whey blend! I use this to mix with shakes or post-workout baked goodies! I even add it into our almond flour chocolate chip cookies, Amazing!\n",
      "Cinnamon swirl, cookie dough, whipped vanilla & peanut butter marshmallow are my favorites!\n",
      "This doesn't mix well. I have Smores, PB Marshmallow, and Red Velvet. All 3 don't mix nearly as well as MyoFusion or ON. (I use just a standard BB shaker.) It's not terrible flavored either although I'm not a fan of chunk of chocolate etc for flavoring. Overall this is a solid protein; I'll just be sticking to MyoFusion and ON going forth. \n",
      "Took advantage of the buy 2 get 1 free, and very glad that i did! The mint chocolate chip tastes just like melted friendly's ice cream, the cinnamon swirl is delicious and the cake batter isn't the best tasting but works well into pancakes and other recipes. \n",
      "If you love peanut butter you won't be disappointed with this product. Mixes great, no need for a blender ball in your shaker. Can't wait to try the other flavors!\n",
      "mixes like concrete and sticks to your shaker like glue. i bought a few 2lb jugs of this garbage to switch things up a bit from my usual gold standard and that was a mistake. literally worst protein ive ever had\n",
      "Great taste, mixes well.  No issues at all.  I will order again.\n",
      "OMG mind blowing protein. Def will buy more!!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's great, good protein level, got some BCAA floating in there, flavor is top notch....I hate chocolate flavor, but the molten chocolate is amazing.  Powder mixes quick, and goes down smooth. I give it a ten\n",
      "Solid product \n",
      "\n",
      "I am obsessed with almost all flavors in this line but Mint Chocolate Chip might be my favorite as it tasted exactly like Baskin Robbins flavor ice cream.  mixes great, either with ice, just water or in a microwave brownie...love it.\n",
      "Good price but bad taste, I can only have it blending with fruits also difficult to stir it kind of doesn't dissolve.\n",
      "I would say compared to ON's Gold Standard, COR-Performance Whey is a solid competitor. Price per serve gold standard is the winner for sure but the taste of Cellucor's products are much better in my opinion. I prefer Cor-Performance Whey over Gold Standard.\n",
      "Overall, a very good protein with a great profile. I also like that it had added lactase and gave me no digestive issues due to my lactose intolerance. I personally did not enjoy the cookies and cream or peanut butter marshmellow as I did feel a chemical after taste. I did enjoy cinnamon swirl though.\n",
      "I love this, it tastes amazing and has a lot of protein\n",
      "This one tastes great. I also purchased the S'mores and the Molten Chocolate. The S'mores has these tiny bits of graham cracker and marshmallow that will NOT break down no matter how much you shake your shaker. The flavor was good but I had to slam them just to get past the pieces everywhere. Molten Chocolate isn't bad either - just be warned about the S'mores\n",
      " \n",
      "Cor whey is my favorite whey on the market currently. Profile is perfect, most flavors taste amazing, it's pretty low in calories so mixing it with milk isn't a problem. Only thing I've really noticed is that the Molten Chocolate gets VERY thick when mixed with 2 scoops in milk. \n",

      "The taste isn't the greatest but is most definitely tolerable. On the other hand great product, one of the things i've noticed is is doesn't make my stomach hurt like other proteins and mixes pretty good with only a spoon.  \n",
      "This is easily one of the worst tasting \"cake batter\" mixes I've had. I initially bought it based on the overall taste rating it was given. How people enjoyed this is beyond me. I mix my whey protein with water, which does effect the flavor, but I have had plenty of other shakes that taste great with water. I won't say it is a complete waste of money, but I personally would not buy any COR-Performance Whey again. Cinnamon Swirl and S'Mores weren't as bad, but no more than a 6 overall in taste. \n",
      "The Cellucor protein is a solid product in any flavor but I have just tried the Mint Chocolate Chip and love it!  It is now my favorite go to flavor of all my proteins, Cellucor or other.  I do feel the flavor could be a little stronger but I'm not complaining.  I did have a sample of ONs Mint Choc platinum hydrowhey and that one does have an advantage over this one but for the promotion price, Cellucor is where it is at. Completely satisfied with this product in all flavors I've had but loving the Mint Choc Chip specifically.  \n",
      "\n",
      "CInnamon swirl is also a great one but I use it more often for an oatmeal mix, plain yogurt mix, or french toast rather than a shake.  It is great on it's own though!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hands down Cellucor is the best company for making protein. I have tried 2 flavors so far. (currently ordered PP and marshmallow and mint chocolate a couple days ago)  Molten chocolate and cinnamon swirl. To be honest, I actually liked Molten chocolate better than cinnamon swirl, but anyway, you cant go wrong with Cellucor. Mixes good, tastes good, and its also very good for cooking. Would recommend to anyone!\n",
      "So I rate both Cinnanmon Swirl and Molten Chocolate a 10/10 on taste. Mixability I give Cor-Whey a 9/10 as occasionally some does not mix as well in milk as I prefer when using a blender bottle, but does great in water, and makes awesome smoothie's/protein shakes in a blender. Love the combination of 25gr of protein with very little calories. I use generally 1-1/2 scoop post workout for my recovery and to help with gains. This protein is great to cook with, from pancakes, to brownies, to muffins, you name it. If looking to be adventurous Chef Bob has some amazing recipes and always taste delicious even if your a horrible cook/chef. Hands down a staple in all my stacks, and when the buy 2 get 1 deal is running on the 2lbs tubs always a great chance to stack up and get several flavors.  \n",
      "Tastes too good. Finished 2lbs in under 2 weeks. I'm fat.\n",
      "\n",
      "10/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Would purchase again\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently bought this and though i dont know how to rate the effectiveness, i feel like the macros are very good and its worth the quality of protein you are paying for. When it comes to taste i feel like they all have the same flavor when it comes to mixing it with water except the mint chocolate chip, my lord it tastes so **** good i would just drink it for the flavor if it didnt make me **** my intestines out. The others all taste like vanilla to me, i dont know if it is because the flavors were messed up because i tasted them one after the other with like 30 minute gaps. If i had to recommend anything though it would be the mint choclate chip.\n",
      "Cor-fetti cake batter - not bad for one or two times. \n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl - the taste of divine)))!\n",
      "Molten Chocolate tastes like real cocoa.\n",
      "Red Velvet Cake Batter - nice taste!\n",
      "\n",
      "I came to conclusion that Cellucor COR-Performance Whey - is the only one whey that I can simly drink with water without any unpleasant feelings. So it's number one brand for me))\n",
      "Texture is so thick, its like i was drinking a casein. Too many bubbles even if shaken for 5-10 seconds, takes aboutan hour for bubbles to go away. Flavors are great but not what I expected. Ill stick with ON whey\n",
      "Great taste with PB marshmallow, tolerable taste with strawberry, TERRIBLE with Cake Batter. Terribly thick texture with cake batter as well if you are using it for a protein shake. But the other two mixed well and had a good texture.\n",
      "a great protein for PWO and baking/mixing!! I absolutely LOVE the corfetti flavor and mix it with my yogurt (better than ice cream in my opinion). Can't wait to try the other flavors.\n",
      "The Smores is horrible... has little marshmellows that clog up in my shaker cup... and they add no nutritional value. The Product is fine though. Does what whey does. Builds muscle. Not as mixable as I'd like though.\n",
      "By far the best tasting protein powder i have ever tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "LOVE! I love all of the Cor-Performance Whey flavors, but this one is so versatile. I love mixing it in my oats (makes it taste like a no-bake cookie) or even blending it up with my coffee in the morning and it's like a protein hot chocolate! The tiny marshmallows are just the icing on the cake. \n",
      "\n",
      "My other favorite flavors include: Mint Chocolate Chip, and Peanut Butter Marshmallow -- always have these in the cupboard at home!\n",
      "After hearing lots of good reviews and feedback about this protein powder, I bought a 5 sample pack. I LOVE EVERY SINGLE ONE! It blends easily and tastes amazing! Its great in shakes as well as in baking.\n",
      "I am new to the supplement market and  thought I'd give a few different flavors a try.  This one was my favorite flavor I tried! \n",
      "My favorite protein hands down! Love the variety of flavors and the taste is outta this world! Also a very clean protein in terms of macros, love it!\n",
      "The Red Velvet Cake Batter is my favorite Cellucor whey protein. I personally like to bake with it or add it to greek yogurt. TASTES LIKE DESSERT! Mixes easily and is never clumpy.\n",
      "I love almost all cellucor flavors but this one leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. I have to mix pumpkin in it to even get it down \n",
      "Simply delicious!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Good powder mixed good but did not like the PB Marshmallow... Loved Molten chocolate!\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried cinnamon swirl, cookies and cream, and s'mores. These are the best tasting powder products I've ever used.\n",
      "This product mixes very well in just a blender bottle and water - minus the tiny cookie bits it's very smooth.  The cookie bits took a little getting used to, but I really like the flavor, it's not overly sweet.\n",
      "I like to mix the Cinnamon Swirl with a scoop of vanilla and it tastes just like the milk after eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch!\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the Cellucor, and the Optimum Nutrition proteins, its always a toss up for me on which to get. Out of the all the Cellucor flavors I have to say the molten chocolate is by far the best I have tried, with cookies and cream coming in second. While I appreciate the dehydrated strawberries in that flavor, it somehow has an overpowering taste of artificial sweetener. \n",
      "Cellucor has been my go to protein now.  I drink this every single day.  Some flavors I liked way more then others\n",
      "My first trying any of Cellucor's products. I've only had one serving and I absolutely LOVE the flavor! (I was very skeptical when I ordered it). I can't attest to  its performance capabilities just yet though. \n",
      "First time using protein from Cellucor, and loved it. I've only tried the Cinnamon Swirl flavor but it was great for making protein pancakes and other recipes. Good as a shake as well since it dissolves easily. Would definitely order again, and would like to see them come out with a Whey Isolate Protein. \n",
      "Best flavor I have. Its delicious and gets me a good pump  of energy. Love the little maqhrmallow pieces\n",
      "Not a bad protein overall. Prefer ON myself though. Cellucor flavors are a little too artifical tasting for my liking.\n",
      "i just opned my first tub of whipped vanilla. The flavor is like a vanilla ice cream that i remebered taking during summer grade. Really nice. i havnt seen the improvement yet but im looking forward for that since it shows trhat it has only 120 cals and only 3 gns of sugar. Gonna stick with this and try to kill til get wheysted!\n",
      "The taste of the protein is amazing. For how little carbs are in it, I'm actually blown away. The consistency is very thick though, like actual cake batter. If that's what your into then it's perfect for you. I've tried most flavors cellucor offers and they're all pretty **** good. Would recommend to anyone!\n",
      "Simply the best whey protein i have used so far from one of the top companies!\n",
      "I have been a loyal fan of Optimum Nutrition for many years, but I really don't like their chocolate flavors, & I wanted something that I don't need to mix with anything but water (I don't use milk). So I bought a few flavor samples of this. I have def found a new Whey to use. It mixes easily, no clumps, no chemical taste, and a lot of the flavors are gluten free (not sure how much gluten could be in the other flavors). PB Marshmallow is my favorite, with Mint Chocolate Chip coming in second. It tastes almost like ice cream (almost). Red Velvet is good but tastes like plain cake batter to me, nothing red velvet about it. And again, I mix it with just ice & water. \n",
      "\n",
      "This would be a 9 or 10 if it wasn't so thick. Overall very good, one of the best, but not the best. Mixes OK, taste pretty good and has great macros. Just don't put it in a blender. \n",
      "I was really not into the flavor of Whipped Vanilla. I generally strongly prefer vanilla flavored protein powders, but this one had a really weird texture. It tasted way too frothy to me, like I was drinking whipped cream. Overall the product mixes really well, though. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl is delicious; it has a hint of cinnamon and isn't overly sweet. I was a little disappointed by the red velvet, because I didn't think it tasted that red velvety. Maybe cream cheese frosting flavor with it would have been better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great value for what you're getting, no protein spiking going on here! Mixed awesome and had a smooth taste. Not too watery like ON or sweet like MP. Will certainly buy this whey for now on and can't wait to try the other awesome flavors!\n",
      "Great whey- mixes well, tastes great. S'mores has teeny tiny marshmallows in it. Which are adorable. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have tried several flavors and it seems you can't go wrong with any of them. Nice to have that variety. \n",
      "Bland and poor chocolate flavor. Mostly taste like marshmallow \n",
      "\n",
      "COR-Fetti: really good.. taste like vanilla cake\n",
      "Molten Chocolate: PERFECT! strong taste and not too sweet.\n",
      "PB Marshmallow: has a very strong and mouth-watering peanut butter smell, but not as strong taste wise.\n",
      "Red Velvet: good at first, but gets a little sickly.\n",
      "good stuff! \n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucor is one of the top brands on bodybuilding.com. There is a reason why  this product is the second top-selling product here. I loved the Strawberry Milkshake flavour. The other 2 were not bad either. Good stuff here. Recommended.\n",
      "My favorite protein shake by far!  Great taste, I actually enjoy slamming 2 scoops after a tough workout.  If you're a peanut butter freak you'll love PBM, S'mores is a very close second.  The \"marshmallows\" in S'mores are a little weird and sink to the bottom of your shake but you'll like it in weird way....   Very clean, high protein.  Get it.\n",
      "Great protein with a great taste! If you love PB, you're gonna love this too!\n",
      "best tasting protein i have had so far\n",
      "Huge scoops, 2LBs does not last very long.\n",
      "Mixes well and they have a ton of flavors to choose from.  My all time favorites are tied for Cinnamon Swirl and PB Marshmallow.\n",
      "2nd time using this product, great flavor, lean yet filling. Great first thing in  the morning before hitting the gym or as a late evening meal replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoy Cellucor and have used a couple of their protein powders. First off, the smell. It smells good. I first tried a serving with plain almond milk. Unfortunately I didn't care for the taste. For me there was a slight aftertaste. It mixed decent in a mixing bottle. But I decided to give it a second chance and use it my protein shake. I put a serving in my blender cup with some unsweetened almond milk, stirred it and stuck in the fridge overnight. In the morning I pulled it out, added half a banana, half cup strawberries and one ice cube. I used my blender to blend. I took it to the gym where it sat in the fridge for 2 hours. Then I drank it. It was delicious! It was thick, didn't separate and went down great!\n",
      "I'm following a ketogenic diet to lose weight. Cellucor is great for when I'm having sugar cravings - I mix one scoop in about 8 ounces of water with 2 tablespoons of heavy cream. I'm down 40 pounds so far, so it must be working!\n",
      "\n",
      "So far I've tried the PB Marshmallow, Cinnamon, and Cake Batter flavors. I loved the first two. The PB Marshmallow tastes just like fluffernutter sandwiches, and the Cinnamon Swirl is like the milk left in the bowl after eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch. The Cake Batter tastes like vanilla chemicals to me. It's not undrinkable, but it's not enjoyable.\n",
      "This is an excellent product. The taste profile of the S'more COR-Performance Whey was extraordinary. Cellucore went so far as to include small graham cracker and mini marshmallows in the Whey mix. In addition to great taste the nutrition facts were on point - low sugar, low net carbohydrates, high protein - exactly what I was looking for. \n",
      "\n",
      "This product was just okay. It made me a little nauseous after having it consecutively everyday.. also when I tried to bake with it, it just turned me off from that food. \n",
      "I will not be buying this again. Also didn't mix well with water \n",
      "\n",
      "Sits well and tastes above average to excellent.  Overall, this is my favorite protein.  I preferred 8oz of water per scoop, however.\n",
      "Of all the proteins out there, this is the one i find my self ALWAYS coming back to. The peanut butter marshmallow is the best flavor hands down. I know some may arguably say other flavors are better, but this flavor is truly the flavor that keeps me coming back to their great protein! Once again, thanks for creating this bottle of wonderful!  \n",
      "I tried this in my oatmeal and it tasted delicious, I love the little confetti sprinkles too -nice touch. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I just received my 1st order of Cellucor's Peanut Butter Marshmallow Whey.  I could hardly wait for my \"snack time\" to arrive to try it.  DELICIOUS!  Yeah, I screamed that, LOL.  It really is very tasty.  I'll tell you what, I look forward to trying some of the other flavors as well.  Bravo Cellucor!  You have a new fan and new customer in me.\n",
      "I like this protein powder for shakes and smoothies, but I do not recommend baking with it. It has a chewy texture when baked, and if you dont eat your goodies right away they develop an \"off\" smell. It is also hard to mix in a shaker bottle and turns out pretty chunky if I dont blend it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely my favorite protein I've tried. Best tasting, I look forward to having this protein.\n",
      "Good protein, mixes very well. Flavor is a little on the strong side.\n",
      "I honestly can't give this product less than 1 0 for all aspects: Quality, Value, Taste, etc. All around, it's just AWESOME :) I generally use this post-workout as a shake on the way to work or make protein pancakes with it on the weekends. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability with water is great and it also works well for baking (like pancakes). The macros of this powder match perfectly with what I'm looking for. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon swirl tastes JUST like cinnamon toast crunch & Peanut Butter Marshmallow tastes just like a sweet peanut butter - love them both!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cor-fett and Red Velvet Cake Batter are both great! Not my go-to, but great for switching things up : ) \n",
      "\n",
      "I recently went on a limb & bought S'mores & LOVED it. To my surprise, there's little marshmallows & pieces of graham crack too...wicked cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also tried Mint Chocolate Chip and love that as well. Haven't tried a flavor I didn't like!\n",
      "This is the greatest tasting protein I have ever tasted period. Not only is the taste top notch it blends well with with water and other foods. I personally have this protein powder with a cup of oats in the morning and I'm finding it very hard to have my oatmeal any way else. This protein powder gets a huge thumbs up. \n",
      "S'mores tastes delicious!! Only thing that would make this product better if If you didn't have to let the shake sit after you mixed it an order for the marshmallows to soften up. The taste is great and the product is great. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon swirl was disgustingly sweet.\n",
      "Has a bit of a plain taste to it. Similar to cinnamon swirl. Still a great product and great for muscle building and recovery. \n",
      "By far my favorite powdered protein! Mixes really well and easily. Flavors are amazing. Easy on the stomach. Especially like the mix of ingredients and nutritional aspect.\n",
      "One of my favorite protein powders. Had consistently great results. Mixes well and tastes very good in vanilla and cinnamon swirl. I think this is my favorite vanilla.\n",

      "After using the same protein for over a year I decided to give Cellucor whey a shot. The cor-fetti and red velvet flavors really peaked my interest so I ordered the 3 tub special with the C4. The cor-fetti, red velvet and mint flavors are absolutely delicious and mix very well with water. I will be re-ordering these flavors next month!\n",
      "CAUTION: ROCK HARD MINI MARSHMALLOWS THAT WILL CRACK YOUR TEETH. Imagine Several rocks about half the size of a tic-tac. They remain rock hard even after over an hour. The only reason I know that it because it tasted so bad i couldn't bring myself to finish it. MASSIVE CLUMPING! It's ridiculously hard to mix. Not to mention the smell is NAUSEATING. Literally any other flavor is fine. I'd go with cinnamon swirl.\n",
      "I purchased a 4lb of Molten Chocolate, and as a special it came with two sample packages (4 servings) of two flavors of my choice.This whey mixes GREAT, in both water and milk! Too bad it doesn't taste as good as it mixes though. The taste (of the Molten Chocolate) is just below that of Six Star Pro Nutrition (Triple Chocolate). The COR-Fetti Cake Batter tastes more like vanilla than anything else, and the Red Velvet Cake Batter is just a fail. It's a clean source of protein and it digests well, I can't deny that, but if you want something that's tasty too then I'd recommend something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "i ordered the  Build-Your-Own COR-Performance Whey 24 Serving custom stack.\n",
      "shipping: got it with in under two days :) (about 36 hours)\n",
      "taste: so far I've tried the peanut butter marshmallow and the red velvet so far they have been stunning and really filling all it took for me was one scoop in some soy milk and i was good to go \n",
      "price: quite affordable as compared to other brands and packs \n",
      "variety of flavor availability: epic i have 6 flavors to chose from in my pack but there is over 9 flavors to chose from this pick 6 gives you enough options to keep your protein regimen interesting \n",
      "i give it a 9/10 because i haven't tried all the flavors yet i m sure it'll turn into a 10/10 when i get done trying them all \n",
      "Haven't tried a flavor that wasn't good. For starters, the way they mix rocks! Smooth, creamy, and almost fluffy--even mixing it in plain water! It's like a pudding. No chalkiness and no funny aftertaste.\n",
      "Cor-fetti Cake Batter is in-freaking-credible! Holy cow! The name says it. I love that it has \"sprinkles\" in it. Truly tastes like the cake mix. \n",
      "Mint Chocolate Chip is also excellent, but not overpowering. The flavor is not odd like other versions I've tried. Bonus..it has little \"chocolate bits\" in it. \n",
      "S'Mores is also extra fun because of the little bits of graham and tiny marshmallows! The powder flavor is like a cross between chocolate and graham.\n",
      "Whipped Vanilla is a light and not over-powering vanilla. They did well on not making \"plain vanilla\" at all boring.\n",
      "Molten Chocolate also not overpowering, and doesn't have that weird aftertaste some chocolate proteins have. Again, they did well on a basic flavor. \n",
      "Strawberry Milkshake tastes pretty much how it sounds. A bit of creaminess along with the strawberry flavor.\n",
      "Red Velvet Cake Batter is a lot like the chocolate, but with a hint of red velvet cake mix taste. I feel it could be a bit stronger and still not be  overpowering. \n",
      "Peanut Butter Marshmallow is really not strong on either end for the two flavors. A very good balance of the two. A hint of peanut butter and the creamy flavor of marshmallows. \n",
      "Cookies N Cream is much better than any other brand I have tried, and a lot like the Whipped Vanilla, only with \"cookie bits.\"\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl is almost like a creamy cinnamon if that makes sense. Very good flavor. \n",
      "Really enjoy Cellucor COR-Performance Whey.  I have tried most all of the flavors and have yet to be let down.  The Molten Chocolate is great for making sludge.\n",
      "I love this protein powder. I have been torturing myself with terrible tasting protein that is expensive with lesser ingredient ratios for WAY too long. The cake batter is more sweet than anything, less cake batter-y, but tastes great plus has sprinkles, that's why I gave it an 8. The s'mores has little bits of crunchy \"marshmallows\" in them (I think that's what they are supposed to be, who cares, they taste awesome), and the PB is just plain awesome. I like them all, will purchase them all again. They mix VERY well, to my happy surprise. . But still very good. The nutritional facts of this protein are spot on for my preference, a well made product. \n",
      "Great value and flavor selection. Is great mixed with coconut water.\n",
      "Dissolves easy. Got on special promo price to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peanut butter marshmallow flavor is amazing.  The best whey flavor I have ever tried.   This seems to have all the same calories/sugar as most and tastes great.  Had slight issues getting all powder to mix in a shaker.    Will buy again\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been on ON Gold Standard for the past 2 years or so. I just wanted to try something new so I decided to try out Cellucor COR-Performance Whey since the contents were very much comparable. OMG. I have been missing out! The flavor is so much better than ON Gold Standard, similar content yet cheaper. Definitely pays to explore rather than just following the crowd with herd mentality. I will be using this product in the future. Mixes easily with either milk or water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start off by saying I have tried virtually every protein out there; 100% Gold Standard, Syntha-6, Pro-Jym, Truetien, Elite Whey, Iron Series, you get the idea. First off, how people are rating the TASTE and TEXTURE of this product a 10/10 is beyond me. I can tell you the mint chocolate chip AT FIRST does taste minty and good, but the after taste is absolutely HORRIBLE. I could not finish drinking it. It has such a chemical taste to it. For the PB Marshmallow, I just don't understand. Every review I've read says it is the one of the best tasting protein powders they have every tried, but it made me want to throw up. I don't know, it might be just me, but I absolutely hate this protein powder. The ONLY reason why I gave it a 7/10 on the overall rating is because the ingredient profile is top notch and is not spiked. My only conclusion is that all the youtube videos and reviews claiming that this product is amazing are planted. I just can't see how this product would get more than a 7/10 (and thats being extremely generous). \n",
      "I actually purchased PB Marshmallow, Cinnamon Swirl, Cookies N' Cream, Molten Chocolate, COR-FETTI Cake Batter. So far I've only tried the 1st 4 listed. The PB Marshmallow is amazing and has a strong PB flavor (even better when mixed with unsweetened almond milk). I am a PB fanatic and this is hands down the best PB protein powder I've ever had. The Molten Chocolate is very good. The Cinnamon Swirl is surprisingly good. I was hesitant to order it because I'm not high on cinnamon flavored drinks but I trusted the reviews of others and it doesn't disappoint. I mainly mix this one with water and oats. The Cookies N' Cream is decent but I wouldnt order it again. Overall: great taste, legit company, good price (B2G1 free), good nutrient profile and no added fillers. Winner winner chicken dinner.\n",

      "This is my favorite protein powder.  It mixes well in water and as a shake.  It's creamy and full of flavor.  I've tried many protein powders, and they are all pretty bland.  Molten chocolate is my favorite, but I also really love the cinnamon swirl, strawberry milkshake, peanut butter marshmallow, whipped vanilla, and corefetti cake batter.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just bought the Whey Performance Stack and tried the Peanut Butter Marshmallow with the 1 scoop of the dextrose (usually I go 2 scoops each), and man... The best tasting protein I ever tried by far!\n",
      "Love every flavor! Great for baking \n",
      "First time to try Cellucor protein. Decided to try it out because of the 3 tub +HD bundle. I has great mixability and great calorie/carb/protein amounts, but the flavor is lacking. I tried pb marshmallow, red velvet cake batter, and mint chocolate chip and all three flavors are weak. (I scoop with ~8oz water).  They don't have a bad after taste or anything like that and they smell really great, but the flavors I tried have barely any taste at all.\n",
      "This was the first protein powder I ever tried. When I tried another product, expecting the same amazing flavor as Cellucor, boy was I disappointed. Very few products can touch the flavor and mixability of Cellucor. I've tried four different flavors and they're all excellent. And it's hard to beat that many grams of protein for those few calories. These guys do it right!\n",
      "Tastes great, I trust the company, but wish it were a better value.\n",
      "The best protein I've ever had. I just switched from a certain red packaged protein, which wasn't as lean as this. The Cellucor flavors are good not great. Cinnamon Swirl is a tad too sweet for me, but amazing. COR-Fetti is delicious, Molten Chocolate needs to be stronger, and the Peanut Butter Marshmallow is great! Very lean protein that helps me recover. I've hardly had any soreness while on this and no stomach problems, unlike our Red cannister friend. I'm definitely a fan and will keep using (this along with HD, CLK, C4) and recommending this to everyone. My GF takes this and loves it too! No bloated feeling and it mixes well! Couldn't be happier. I take it in the morning, sometimes before workout and definitely after workout. I don't feel bloated like with others and I've seen some very nice gains of muscle in about a month or less. Great product and I cannot wait to taste the other flavors!\n",
      "For the most part it's a good performance protein. Mixes well and is a little thicker which helps fill me up. However the cake batter is unbearable. Doesn't taste like anything relative to cake and the fun fetti feels like small bits of plastic in your mouth. So good diet attempt but the flavor is not there\n",
      "I was a little dissatisfied with the flavor of the cinnamon swirl, only because I have had other brands of \"cinnamon swirl/bun\" flavor whey proteins and it had a much better/stronger flavor. Another thing is I think all of the cellular whey proteins mix weird or chunky looking in my oatmeal which is just old fashioned oats with water mixed together. Peanut Butter Marshmallow and Red Velvet Cake Batter flavors are very sweet and would only recommend them to those who like sweet, dessert like things. They both defiantly require some creativity like mixing with pancake batter, greek yogurt, etc., instead of just adding with water/milk and having as a normal shake because the flavors are just SO sweet it's over kill.\n",
      "\n",
      "To each their own! \n",
      "\n",
      "PB marshmallow is awesome.  You taste the peanut butter more so than the marshmallow but still delicious.  The confetti cake batter is just like the real thing - and I would know given my experience with licking the bowl from birthdays 4 through  15.   \n",
      "I have had PB Marshmallow, Red Velvet Cake Batter & Cor-fetti\n",
      "\n",
      "I usually use these for baking or in oats or greek yogurt. Cor-fetti is definietly my favorite. Already purchased again, along with the S'mores flavor, can't wait to try that one!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Cellucor's whey is the only protein I buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "they're  just WOW, they're amazing not only on flavor but quailty and I can make pretty much everything with them this is without a doubt my new fav protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hands down the best tasting protein I've had. In addition, it has all the right macros with little sugar and carbs :)\n",
      "One of my favorite proteins especially when cutting.\n",
      "this is my first quality protein powder that ive ordered and for me it works and tastes way better than crappy store brands that ive used.\n",
      "i ordered both PB marshmallow and mint choc chip and they both taste like they should however the PB tastes like PB2 but thats not an issue for me, and as far as the mint choc chip its my favorite so far because it tatses just like min choc chip ice cream when you blend it with ice and milk,\n",
      "I will defiantly buy these again and s****est them to anyone looking for a good and tasteful protein powder.\n",
      "Best tasting protein product I have ever come across. It is a little more expensive unfortunately, so I'd go with this over gold standard if you can get a deal on it. I ordered Red Velvet, Cinnamon Swirl, and Peanut butter Marshmallow. They are all fantastic, but Red velvet is definitely my favorite. It seriously tastes like your drinking a piece of cake.\n",
      "This product is AWESOME! I would recommend it to anybody. The cinnamon swirl flavor is so good, i am planning on getting a lot more of that, the other flavors i tried (peanut butter marshmallow and s'mores) was also quite good, but they have chunks of marshmallow in them, which I did not like. It makes you feel like it isn't mixed well. If this doesn't bother you, try them! But I would recommend the cinnamon swirl to anybody!\n",
      "Every flavor i have tried is great 3 scoops a day for the last 3 months and and showing nice gains. also love the 3 Pack + C4 Deal. \n",
      "I usually buy MusclePharm or Gold Standard whey, but I wanted to give Cellucor a try and I'm definitely glad I did. The mint chocolate taste like melted mint chocolate ice cream, there was no negative side effects, and it's simply a great protein.\n",
      "Cookies and cream taste so good. I can mix my protein powder with water and it has no nasty after taste. I also love cinnamon flavor also. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My absolute favorite flavor of protein from Cellucor! Makes for great after workout shakes! It also mixes well with oatmeal, and tastes way better than eating plain oatmeal!\n",
      "Cellucor Whey Protein is one of the best protein I have ever had, if not the best protein I've ever had. Molten Chocolate is the best tasting chocolate protein I have ever had. It mixed well with and without a blender, and tasted great with milk or water. The best part about Molten chocolate is that it has the consistency of a Milk shake, it's very thick when mixed with 5oz of milk/water, and tastes amazing. The only reason why I won't rank it higher than Gold Standard is that Cellucor does not offer 10lb sizes. I like to have a big stock that lasts for months at a time rather than buying a new tub every month. COR-Fetti tastes alright, it's nothing really special. It's just vanilla protein with sprinkles in it. Overall, Cellucor protein is a great buy.\n",
      "So far, this has been the best protein powder I have tried. I will be sticking with this for a long while. The digestive enzymes are A+. So much better on the stomach that other protein powders. the Whipped Vanilla is the best flavor also.\n",
      "This is an ok product. The flavor has a weird taste to it, it's not terrible but it's not great either.\n",
      "Really like this protein powder for the macros and flavors. I alternate between this and Optimum Gold depending whats on sale. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall good protein. Taste was average but cant really complain. The cookies and cream flavor was lacking somewhat as far as mixability goes likely due to the little chunks of quasi-cookie stuff in it. The price is generally pretty reasonable and I wouldnt hestitate to both use it again and recommend to others. \n",
      "I love this protein powder.. Mixes really well and doesn't cause any stomach problems... \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good protein powder. 5.5g bcaas. I don't see a BCAA profile on the container though. Carbs are pretty low, only 3g in the flavors I'm using. Calories are only 130 for most flavors. Low sugar... So if you're cutting then this is decent stuff. Not as great as the real good isolates, but it's also cheaper. I got the stack with 3 -2lb tubs and a 30 serving C4 for around  $76 (had a 10% off coupon code which covered most of the shipping). Hard to beat that price considering the variety I was getting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cake Batter tastes good, but it's just a tad too sweet when I do two scoops... I had to add a little more water than usual, but that's not a huge deal. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Peanut Butter Marshmallow has a strong Peanut Butter taste with a hint of Marshmallow. Tastes pretty good. Didn't have to water this one down because it was too sweet or anything. It was delicious...\n",
      "\n",
      "And the best for last... The Mint Chocolate Chip is the best flavor protein I've ever had. I love it... It tastes like melted mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's like dessert... \n",
      "\n",
      "Considering factors like quality, price, and taste I think I will be ordering this stuff again and trying out other flavors. Very happy with these products...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is pretty good, mixes really smooth and consistent.  Good Price as well\n",
      "Ordered Molten Chocolate, Cinnamon Swirl, and PB Marshmallow during a promotional offer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: \n",
      "           The three flavors mentioned were surprisingly good. Taste is objective so I'll spare the details, but the tastes exceeded expectations, which is not often the case when ordering different protein. I recommend blending the Molten Chocolate with ice (and some 1% milk of tolerable) in a blender, which gives the perception of drinking a rich chocolate shake. It's like having a cheat day without actually cheating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solubility: \n",
      "               The scoops are a little larger than those used by ON and other comparable brands. The powder also seems a bit more dense as well. This makes it more difficult to use with smaller shakers, or for those who prefer a more liquid consistency to their drink. I tried putting four scoops into a 28 oz blender bottle, which is normal to help meet my calculated protein needs, but this made the drink so thick that I ended adding more water to it just to finish. The lack of solubility when compared to some other proteins with comparable ingredients means needing more water, or drinking more often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost: \n",
      "         Bodybuilding often has supplements at discounted prices, and they occasionally have promotions with Cellucor. I try to wait for the buy 2 (at a discounted rate) and get 1 free promotion which pops up from time to time. This gets you an effective product at an affordable cost. Otherwise there are a couple other effective whey products that seem equally effective, but easier on the wallet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effectiveness:\n",
      "                      It helps meet protein needs without the added sugars, carbs, and fat, but it's only as effective you.\n",
      "This is my new favorite protein! I mix it with some almond milk in the morning for breakfast and then after my workout.  Cinnamon swirl taste exactly like the milk after a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch.  That flavor is by far my favorite.  I ordered a 2 pound tub of it and they came free samples of the cake batter, peanut butter marshmallow, and molten chocolate.  Each one I try they taste amazing.  Mixes very well.  I used to think muscle pharm combat was the best tasting protein Ive had but now this takes the title.  Will for sure be buying this again.  \n",
      "I just finally got to open my tub of the cookie n cream and words cant explainhow tasty it was. Honestly tasted like that cookie crisp cereal i used to eat in the 3rd grade. I love this product i havent had it long enough to inform you guys on any gains and such but so far so good product taste great \n",
      "\n",
      "Well I recently joined bodybuilding.com I love the site. Wish I could have found out about this place along time ago! Well Ive never had any of the cellucor products and their was a deal so i got cake batter, smores, and cinnamon swirl! The smores is good, but to me its hard for me to get down some reason.  BUT ALSO I did it with 2 scoops with choc milk for my first time so that could be it but it does taste good! I DID CAKE BATTER ONE SCOOP WITH REG MILK AND I LOVE IT! It tastes so good and i can drink the whole thing in like 2 sips. Ive had muscle milk before ...but the cellucor taste is way better! awesome price. All comment back when I try the smores again and also the cinnamon swirl. Take care everybody! add me i need more friends lol\n",
      "this is 100% my fave protein. if you like mint choc chip ice cream, you will love this. I actually look forward to it post workout. yummy!!\n",
      "Loving cellucor's flavors. By far the best tasting protein I have had. \n",
      "Mixability  is a (9) little clumps floating on top nothing to worry about.Taste not too sweet which I was worried about when it says marshmallow more like a resse without the chocolate very good (9).No bloat or stomach upset Would buy again \n",
      "Picked this up because of all the good things I'd heard, should have tried a sample first. I did not look forward to drinking my shakes at all, it tasted slightly chemical-like and bitter. The ingredient list looks great but the shakes mixed up pretty thick and didn't taste as good as I'd hoped. Mixing with water improved taste a bit, I usually use low fat milk. A bit expensive compared to others. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have used several Cellucor products in the past and was very pleased with them so I decided to try their whey protein.  I have read many posts where people complain about the taste of a product and I have always blown these reviews off.  To me, taste is not as important as the product's performance.  I bought a jug of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry and I am very disappointed with the strawberry.  While I am disappointed with the flavor of all three, the strawberry is by far the worst tasting whey protein I have ever tried.  I even checked the expiration date to be certain that it was not expired.  The strawberry has a very chemical taste and seems to have a burned taste as well. \n",
      "I've only used the whey powder for a couple days now, and really like it. It mixes extremely easily with water or milk and in either case it does not give you a 'brick in the stomach feeling' or even much a full feeling. For taste, the strawberry was my least favorite, the peanut butter marshmallow tastes like the peanut butter filling of a Butterfinger bar, and if you mix a half scoop of the peanut butter marshmallow and a half scoop of the chocolate - it's like drinking a Butterfinger bar. That said none of the flavors are overly sweet at all (either a plus or minus depending on what you like). The flavors (intensity & sweetness) are about a step down from Syntha-6. Definitely a great product! \n",
      "So there are very few flavors of the protein that I haven't tried. Overall I would have to say that they are all pretty good. However, it is important to note the I do not actually use any other these in a shake. I've personally found that the best \"whey\" to utilize these powders is when making pancakes or waffles. They have also been very good when mixed in my proats or overnight oats. So if you are looking for something for a post workout shake I would look else where. But they make some bomb a$$ pancakes! Gotta get those Cellucor PancakeGainz!\n",
      "One of the first proteins that I had ever purchased. The quality of this protein is really high and you can just tell when you mix it and taste it. Low fat, Low carb and sugar are all positives of this protein. At only 130 calories per scoop for 25g of protein is really nice for my low calorie diet. The Cinnamon swirl flavor is my favorite out of the two that i bought. It tastes like real cinnamon and no artificial taste at all. I like to mix it into my night time greek yogurt snack and its amazing. The mint chocolate chip is not my favorite flavor but its not bad either. Its pretty good but I got tired of it quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Got this a few days ago and wow, it is the best tasting protein I've ever had.  It really tastes like s'mores and has actual marshmallows and graham cracker pieces which makes it a lot different from other proteins because there is a sort of crunch every time you sip it, which is okay by me.  Macros are really good as well.  Will definitely buy this again.\n",
      "I just purchased this product and I already LOVE it! I can't wait to try the other flavors!\n",
      "love love love love\n",
      "I have no words to explain how much I love this protein. I've tried about 5 different kinds and this is by far the greatest. I got 3 tubs of it via Bodybuilding.com sales, and I will never buy a different brand. The taste is phenomenal, although I do mix the mint chocolate chip with a little of the chocolate because I prefer it that way. I take it right after my workouts and can automatically tell a difference with my muscle recovery and tightness. I still have a month and a half's supply left and just purchased some more because I don't even want to get close to being out of this. Worth every penny and then some!\n",
      "I don't usually take the time to write reviews on here, but I felt compelled to write a review on this one.  The Mint Chocolate Chip whey tastes amazing!  It literally tastes like you're drinking an Andes mint.  Blend it with your milk of choice (I usually use light soy milk or light almond milk) + some ice and it tastes like you're drinking a mint chocolate ice cream shake.  VERY good stuff!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the taste, mixability is very good, and the ingredient profile is great, too.\n",
      "I JUST TRIED THIS YESTERDAY AND ITS HONESTLY THE MOST AMAZING FLAVOR OF PROTEIN IVE EVER HAD!! YOU GUYS NEED TO MAKE THIS AN OFFICIAL FLAVOR I WILL BUY THIS EVERY SINGLE TIME I RUN OUT!!!! I REALLY CANT EXPLAIN HOW GOOD THIS TASTES!! TEAM CELLUCOR!!\n",
      "If your looking to muscle up and slim down body fat this is a great product in my eyes low in fat high in protein and low cal and it TAST great. \n",
      "Good protein powder!  Red velvet cake batter = greatest flavor EVER!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Tasting Protein = #1..Finally I have found a decent tasting protein powder. Its been a long time coming lol...Mint Choco Chip = My favorite..the mint isn't super strong but its so good, i sometimes crave it. Cookies &Cream = Decent, has little cookies bits in it, and tastes similar, just has a bit of an after  taste. Red Velvet= tastes just like the real thing. Its really good.\n",
      "I think this whey has solid nutrition as far as macros and sugar but I do think it tastes a bit synthetic. I've tried both flavors above as well as the s'mores, and I think the cake and c'n'c both taste the same - just sweet. The s'mores is..... better. I might try cinnamon swirl but if it's still super sweet I'll probably go back to optimum or try something else. Otherwise I think it has helped me gain a decent amount of muscle in the time that I've been seriously lifting and using it.\n",
      "I'll say that the protein is good, no noticeable difference (in terms of effect) from the ON GS I used previously. It smells and tastes of chemicals though. \n",
      "I tried this product during the Buy one 4lb get another 50% off.  And Cellucor just gained a new customer for Whey Protein. I use to get ON 100% but after trying the Peanut Butter Marshmallow I was sold just because their product just taste so much better.  For my post-workout I use one scoop of Molten Chocolate and one scoop Peanut Butter Marshmallow. (Its taste great and if you still have a COLD water bottle to use it with it reminds me of a Chocolate Peanut Butter Milkshake if you use less water to make it thick.)  \n",
      "Mixes instantly, tastes amazing, clean profile.\n",
      "Cellucor is definitely becoming a staple in my supplement stack. I was impressed with Cellucor's C4 and even more impressed with their protein. The protein's profile is great. It's everything anyone would look for when trying to find a protein that would help meet their fitness goals. The price on this product is pretty normal; not expensive but not cheap. But the flavors I'd have to say are pretty out of this world. Cellucor's Cor-Fetti, is pretty good, it's definitely different, and extremely on the sweeter side. If you get this flavor, I'd say get it to cook with and/or to mix it into other foods such as greek yogurt for some extra protein intake. Now for cinnamon swirl... it's probably my all time favorite protein. The taste is phenomenal when mixed with milk, seriously tastes just like cinnamon toast crunch the cereal. It's a must have if you're order their stack. You'll look forward to it every time after a workout. I guarantee it. If not, then send me the tub and I will finish it for you. (: In all, get the protein. Great nutritional value, decent price, and great flavors.\n",
      "I was so excited to try this product .  When I opened it up the smell was unpleasent. I figured it couln't be that bad in taste. Well I was wrong it was as bad as it smelled. Not happy at all wit this flavor. Im now scared to get a new flavor after this exeperince and $29 dollars thrown in the trash.\n",
      "Started using Cellucor's COR-Performance Whey about five or six months ago and haven't switched to a different brand since. I use it in both my breakfast (oatmeal + whey + mixed berries) and post-workout shake which happen to be my favorite meals of the day because of it. My favorite flavors by far are Cinnamon Swirl, Molten Chocolate and Peanut Butter Marshmallow. I've tried almost every flavor except a few of the exclusives. \n",

      "i bought these 3 protein powders expecting them to taste as good as everyone raves about.... i was very disappointed. they all tasted non-flavored!\n",
      "This was my first time purchasing Cellucor Whey as opposed to the GNC brand I used previously. These are some of the best tasting protein powders I've ever had.\n",
      "Both flavors taste great with either water or milk!\n",
      "I would definitely recommend this brand of protein!\n",
      "There are so many things I can say about these products but I will just try to sum it up in one word...AMAZING!!!!  The flavors are pretty darn good (well, Strawberry Milkshake...I will drink it but it's not my favorite).  Works great as my meal replacement for snacks and breakfast when I'm in a hurry.\n",
      "Taste excellent, easiest mixing protein powder. I like it and I recommend this one (if you want to try buy small portion to try first) When I bought this one first time and I try I said the flavor about ok, and I'll tell the difference after workout one day I didn't used it. NOW I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO HAVE EVERYDAY 2 SCOOPS IN THE MORNING AFTER EXCERCISE AND 2 SCOOPS IN THE EVENING.\n",

      "NOW THIS IS A PROTEIN POWDER! holy cow! What TASTE! What Flavor! I cook with it, put it in milk, in my oatmeal, in my frosting, in EVERYTHING! If you enjoy protein for taste THIS is your powder. Cellucor is a fantastic company and this is my favorite whey by far. Great macros. Low fat, low carbs, High protein, low cals, like a protein powder should be. It has everything you need in a powder. I take it morning, pre, post workout, whenever! BUY THIS POWDER! Best flavors are Cinnamon swirl and PB Marshmellow. Red Velvet is THE BEST to cook with though!\n",
      "This is a great protein powder, its thicker than others I've had and the flavours are amazing. I usually add fruit to my shakes but with cellucor these taste fantastic on their own. I'm surprised by how much I've enjoyed the cinnamon swirl.\n",
      "Really good tasting protein. Decent protein to scoop gram ratio, pretty good on calories as well. Would buy again! \n",
      "Definitely the best tasting protein powder on the market, with a wide variety of excellent flavors. My favorite is peanut butter marshmellow; it goes great in oatmeal! Smores, cookies and cream, and corfetti cake batter are also pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The protein does its thing, good price in the B2G1F deal.  Ordered the COR Fetti as a trial of something new.....blown away by how good it is.  Sort of a really yummy Caramel/Vanilla taste.\n",
      "These 2 flavors, as well as S'mores (9/10), molten chocolate(10/10), peanut butter marshmallow(10/10),  and corfetti are all wonderful. My favorite is cinnamon swirl because it's most true to taste. My least favorite is corfetti (7.5/10) because the smell makes me feel nauseous and when it is cooked, the flavor gets kind of lost. Not terrible, just not the best.  I use all of these to make protein pancakes/waffles/mug cakes. I would definitely buy any one of these again in a heartbeat. \n",
      "Great taste, thats the first thing I look for when shopping for any product. This whey has a good taste and better after taste. Noticed  gains very quickly, I do 1 half scoop of ON malt chocolate and 2 scoops of this and its amazing! \n",
      "I ordered a 2Lb container of the s'mores flavor and the trial package of cor-fetti cake batter came with it. After a month of waiting for it to arrive, I did not like either of them! I ordered s'mores because, based on the reviews, it seemed like the best flavor. It was way too sweet and left a horrible after-taste. As did the cake batter flavor. It had the same horrible after-taste. I gave both of them away immediately and went back to my normal protein that I was originally getting tired of. Needless to say, I was so happy to have plain chocolate again! I was tempted to try the Cellucor Cinnamon Swirl flavor but I am affraid that it will have the same taste as the previous two. \n",
      "First, S'MORES FLAVOR IS THE BEST PROTEIN I HAVE EVER HAD. It isn't available for me to rate right now but it's 10/10. The marshmallow and graham cracker pieces are amazing. The PB Marshmallow was disappointing because I had heard it was so great, but it wasn't awful and has an okay flavor. Red Velvet did live up to the immense expectations I had for it, but it was a decent flavor. Cellucor protein requires very little water, unlike other brands where I can add any random amount and it will always taste good. Great protein and can't wait to try other flavors.\n",
      "I purchased the Cellucor COR-Performance Whey because when I bought 2 containers, it was much cheaper than buying whey locally. Based on BB.com recommendations, I tried molten chocolate, mint chocolate chip, and peanut butter marshmallow flavors. The molten chocolate and PB marshmallow flavors are outstanding: better than other flavors of various whey products I have tried. I look forward to drinking them. They mix smoothly and fully. The mint chocolate chip does not really taste like its name, and it almost always has unblended clumps of the powder unless I use an electric blender. All of the varieties are a bit thicker than I would prefer; the formulation could do without so much zantham gum and cellulose thickeners. Overall, a good value, not much extra fat/carbs, and some top flavors.\n",
      "Cellucor was recommended to me by a friend so I gave it a try and found that I didn't love it.  The mint chocolate chip flavor was edible but didn't taste the way you would hope, so I did sometimes have a hard time getting it down.  It also isn't entirely the best for mixability, I couldn't ever just mix it with a spoon or fork, there would be chunks.  It tasted horrible with water also, so I had to use milk/almond milk no matter what.  The cake batter flavor was honestly really gross, the smell of it made me gag.  Taste is high on the list for me so if you're choosing based on that, I wouldn't recommend this protein.  \n",
      "I'm very impressed with the taste of Cellucors whey. I used to be a ON fan, but these flavors have turned me to the other side. Molten chocolate and mint chocolate chip taste just like melted ice cream, very rich and tasty. Cinnamon swirl is amazing in the morning. \n",
      "This is by far the best protein shake I have ever had. I am little picky but this had everything I needed, not too many calories, just enough protein, and the taste is amazing. I drink this for breakfast and after every workout. It blends pretty well. It is a little pricey but it is definitely worth it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mint-chacolate flavor the best to start your morning, if you wanna throw up..lol It's like eating toothpaste , nasty flavor , very poor mixing protein,sticky like a glue, can only imagine what it does to your stomach , will not buy again and not recommending \n",

      "Great Flavor! Helped me survive my figure competition prep! Tastes great mixed in with coffee as well. Just like a cinnamon roll in my mouth! Love this stuff. Also, I would recommend trying the Red Velvet Cake Batter (like red velvet FroYo) if you can still find it and the Cor-Fetti (Just like funfetti cake). ALL SOO SOO yummy!! \n",
      "This is the best protein powder I have tried.  Great flavor.  I got my order yesterday and have already made pancakes, brownies, mug cake and ice cream with it!\n",
      "I'm going to start by saying i was a little skeptical trying the Mint Chocolate Chip flavor with the fear that the mint would be overwhelming and would just plain ol taste nasty.  Boy was I wrong!! Its just the right amount of flavor and to boot they even add pieces of chocolate! How can you beat that?! I honestly don't make shakes with it, i mix it in with plain yogurt and make ice cream.  So as far as drinking it goes i cant tell ya, but id imagine its like drinking ice cream! I do have to say that Cellucor has come through yet again with hitting the flavor right on the head!! Cant wait to see what else they have up their sleeve! \n",
      "While the macros of this are great, the taste was chalky and awful. I have vanilla too but haven't tried it yet. I am just praying it's not as bad as strawberry.\n",
      "Incredible taste, works great as a shake, cake, or sludge topping. Definitely will be getting more!\n",
      "Love the taste of all these flavors and love how quickly it dissolves!  Can't wait to try the other flavors.\n",
      "All four flavors I have tried so far (cinnamon swirl, mint chocolate chip, peanut butter marshmallow and corfetti) are absolutely amazing! I highly recommend all four. So so good! The whey doesn't taste chalky or anything and it doesn't deposit on the bottom of your water bottle either! It tastes amazing when you drink it with almond milk. It also tastes great mixing it with cottage cheese and greek yogurt. You can't top the amazing flavors of cellucor whey. I will definitely be a buyer of this whey for life.  It is so worth the money. Your health is worth the money. The flavors taste true to their name too. My all time favorite of these is the Peanut Butter Marshmallow! It doesn't taste too peanut buttery or anything! SO GOOD!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, very good protein. Would definitely recommend. Tried cinnamon swirl and it was amazing, Smores was pretty good as well but didn't like the vanilla at all (and I usually love vanilla).\n",
      "Peanut Butter Marshmallow....horrible flavor. That is unless you love the taste of PB2, which I do not. It tastes exactly like vanilla whey with some PB2 thrown into it, I used to do that every once in a while. And let me tell you I don't think it tastes very good at all. Nice if it tasted like actual peanut butter and not that PB2 crap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effectiveness wise we shall see since I just started taking it. \n",
      "\n",
      "But choose a different flavor. Glad I only bought 2 lbs for this one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also got a sample of Cor-Fetti cake batter. That stuff tastes horrible too. Tasted like pure chemicals; nasty. \n",
      "\n",
      "update...also just tried the vanilla a few times,, seems to have a similar chemical aftertaste. Seems this stuff is a big disappointment when it comes to the rave on it flavor profile. Definitely not buy again. \n",
      "I'm not even a fan of flavored whey protein, but this stuff tastes really good and I made great gains while I was using it.\n",
      "Great product, great profile.  Mixes well, taste is very nice, not over powering or so sweet that you know it is loaded with sweeteners.  The price of this product is not bad either for what you get.\n",
      "I tried the cookies n cream, chocolate and vanilla and like all 3. The vanilla is awesome mixed w Greek yougurt. Awesome tasting and mixes easy. Will keep buying.\n",
      "This whey is by far the best tasting protein on the market. Also saw great gains while on this product. It is fairly expensive so I only buy it when there's the buy 2 get 1 free. Overall one of the best on the market.\n",
      "This is a very solid protein and if you enjoy mint chocolate chip flavors, this protein is second to none.\n",
      "Cellucor is my second favorite brand (first brand I used) of supplements, so I've tried out a fair amount of their line. The protein is a solid choice. Consistency is good, pretty creamy and mixes well with a proper amount of liquid. I recommend 10-12 oz per scoop. My main gripe is the flavor isn't the best. Strawberry finishes bitter, the cookies in the cookies n' cream are hard pellets which isn't pleasing, and the peanut butter marshmallow would be better labeled as just peanut butter. The price is solid for it and it is on special regularly. If you don't like your protein overly sweet then this might be the brand for you.\n",
      "I have been on the search for a tasty protein that mixes well with water.  I have heard TONS of great things about Cellucor and decided to give this a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability: Great, never had chunks on the bottom left like some of the cheaper products out there.\n",
      "Taste: Taste was great! But I was hoping I would fall in love. It tastes like most chocolate whey with a hint of peanut butter in there. I did try this with milk, and as usual it tastes MUCH better.\n",
      "Macros: This has less protein and more fat than my other protein, but it did taste better. \n",
      "This is a pretty good protein, but not worth this price. You can find a protein that is just as good for much less. I'm not really sure why it has come up to this price. \n",
      "\n",
      "Very similar in quality to other proteins.  May taste better, though.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucor has definitely knocked their protein out of the park. I am a very picky person when it comes to taste, I find most proteins I've tried taste grainy, and the flavour tastes fake, but Cellucor tastes like a true shake. I look forward to using it in my oats, post workout, or even in my protein bars/muffins. I have tried every single flavour except for the vanilla & chocolate raspberry truffle. Only one I did not enjoy was strawberry milkshake, definitely had a strong strawberry taste. --personal preference however. Mixability is awesome, no clumps, and mixes within seconds, as apposed to standing there for 2 minutes trying to shake it all up. Nutrition profile is awesome. I for sure love Cellucor's products, hopefully they can drop some casein in the next year. I'd love to get my hands on that. \n",
      "\n",
      "This protein is great! So many different flavors and they taste so good! The nutrition is great. Mixes perfectly and I discovered so many different ways to use this whey. Love it!!!\n",
      "Love the Peanut Butter Marshmellow Powder!!  I love adding more peanut butter in the shake to give it a more intense taste!! \n",
      "\n",
      "It's great tasting and smelling. I really enjoy it with oatmeal. :)\n",
      "I've never had Cellucor protein before and I absolutely LOOOOOOVE the Cinnamon Swirl flavor. It blends perfectly and makes my bland post-workout shake taste amazing! ( a banana, egg whites, water and ice). The Peanut Butter Marshmallow gets a 9/10 because I've tasted the Myofusion Peanut Butter Cookie Dough flavor protein and it tastes much better. I will definitely need to try the other flavors.\n",
      "Best tasting protein hands down! I've tried gold standard, iso-flex, combat powder, myofusion, BSN, Muscletech, and the list goes on. Cellucor topped all of them in the taste category. The cinnamon swirl is so good I could drink it all day. Chocolate Chip Mint is very tasty too, tastes like an after midnight chocolate stick. The S'mores flavour is seriously to die for. I didn't care much for the peanut butter marshmallow and the strawberry milkshake. Cellucor is kicking *** in the taste category, and really protein is protein, its the taste that really matters.\n",
      "I've bought three of the exclusive flavors. Out of all of them only the mint chocolate chip was bad. This protein is close to perfect. It mixes easily and taste great. I highly recommend it\n",
      "Didn't like it at first, but this flavor really grew on me... that and cake batter is my FAV.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an excellent whey product.  It blends very well and has a preferable flavor to my experience with ON whey.  The only drawback with the Cookies N' Cream flavor is that the \"cookies\" portion tends to blend poorly and stick at the bottom of the shaker cup.  \n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl is so freaking good.\n",
      "Flavor wise I was expecting more out of the cake batter, it just seemed kinda plain to me. But let me tell you about that Cinnamon Swirl, taste like I'm drinking those cinnamon pancakes from Denny's when I mix it with milk, which are delicious I might add. \n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend this protein to all my fitness friends! It tastes like cinnamon toast crunch. I have 5 different flavors of protein by Cellucor and this one is by far my fave!\n",
      "Great product! Good taste. This is my favorite protein. \n",
      "this is the best protein!\n",
      "A good whey protein.  Took advantage one the B1G1 deal a while back and it did not disappoint.  Great taste and mixes well.\n",
      "By far the best protein out there! Flavor breakdown;\n",
      "\n",
      "S'mores :The s'more flavor is awesome! It even has marshmellows in it! 10/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Peanut Butter: Best Flavor! I use it to make cookies and bulking shakes. 10/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Molten Chocolate: My favorite chocolate protein shake! 10/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl: OK flavor, its a little thick and kind of a weird after taste. 9/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies N' Cream:I was disappointed with this flavor. Tastes weird and gross after taste. 7/10\n",
      "Great protein taste great and mixes easily. The s'mores flavor is ****ing delicious and the mint chocolate \n",
      "Low in calories per serving with the most protein (25 grams).. and this flavor is amazzzzzzing. \n",
      "This is by far one of the best flavors I have tasted and one of the best proteins I have used. I always get the stack of Three 2 lbs. tubs and the c4. Great purchase and great money saver. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Where does one begin when it comes to Cellucor products? Especially their whey, I can't get enough of it. I've had the Peanut Butter Marshmallow flavor before and it was phenomenal. And now I got my hands on quite possibly one of the most delicious whey flavors I have ever had, S'mores.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never thought I would be able to have a protein shake that tasted so much NOT like a protein shake. This flavor is incredible and the profile as always is top notch. I can't even begin to formulate educated thoughts about this whey right now, it's that good, all I keep thinking about is making another one. I had my supps shipped to my work and even my boss is now considering ordering the Cor-Performance Whey based strictly on the smell of the S'mores whey.\n",
      "I have never tasted this worst whey protein powder before. ewww...its totally disgusting and diffenitely not my taste. will never go for cellucor protein again. \n",
      "i ll just stick with isopure. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was really skeptical about this flavor. How do you nail 3 flavors in one? Graham cracker bits, chocolate, AND marshmallow pieces?! It's all there. This flavor is perfect and mixes so easily. Tastes great with both water and almond milk.\n",
      "Cinnamon swirl was pretty good, 6/10. I wasn't jumping for joy to have this protein. Definitely know know that Cellucor makes good preworkout and bcaa but I will never buy their protein again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cor-fetti cake batter protein is not the greatest. I gave it such a low rating because I like to make protein sludge with my protein and it's taste is not good, especially compared to other cake batter proteins. \n",
      "\n",
      "Red velvet cake batter was the worse protein I've ever had! 1/10 Horrible for making sludge smells like a chocolate tootsie pop sucker and doesn't smell and/or taste like red velvet AT ALL!! I was highly disappointed! \n",
      "I think one of my all time favorite desserts are s'mores so I was pumped when this flavor got released and it didn't let me down! Such a great flavor ! The added marshmallow pieces and graham chunks take it to a whole new level! I'm a huge fan of the cookie pieces in the cookies and cream so this sits right up there with my previous flavor C&C. Great job Cellucor!\n",
      "Great flavor, even in water...can't imagine how good it would be in milk.  Little cookie pieces are a nice touch, mixes easily, good profile...took advantage of the B1G1, can't wait to try other flavors\n",
      "This is one of the best mixing and tasting Whey Proteins out there. You can't beat the cinnamon swirl. It's like drinking liquid cinnamon toast crunch.\n",
      "Ingredient Profile (9/10): With 25g of protein & only 130 calories per serving, I liked the profile right off the bat. The digestive enzymes also help a lot too for me since some brands of protein don't sit well for me, but thus far I've had no stomach issues whatsoever. Overall it has a pretty solid profile! \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability (8.5/10): Overall they mixed pretty well.  A few leftover clumps after shaking, but nothing to complain about.  It also got pretty frothy, but settled after a few minutes of letting it sit on the counter before drinking. I mixed 1 scoop with about 12oz. of low-fat milk in a shaker bottle. Shook it up for about 10 seconds, and it was mixed pretty good with a nice and smooth texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "COR-Fetti Cake Batter Taste (9/10): I was a little hesitant at first to try this but honestly, really great job by Cellucor with the flavoring on this one! It's smooth and refreshing after a nice workout.  Gives you that cake batter taste to make you feel like you're cheating with your diet, even though this is an extremely healthy alternative. I've also mixed 1 scoop of this with 1 scoop of Molten Chocolate, and it tasted like a chocolate cake! Definitely recommend doing that if you have the chance. Another use I found for this was mixing 1 scoop into some vanilla Greek yogurt, which tastes really great as well!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall (9/10): The COR-Fetti Cake Batter COR-Whey is my 3rd favorite flavor in the line(1. Cinnamon Swirl 2. Strawberry Milkshake). After trying pretty much every flavor, all of them are amazing, but my favorite still has to be Cinnamon Swirl.  Cellucor just seems to keep pumping out great products. Flavor-wise, I don't know another company that compares with every supplement they come out with. I would definitely recommend this protein to anyone looking for something new and delicious with a great ingredient profile. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product, easy to mix with water or milk.  Add ice, bananas and a blender to thicken it up a bit if desired.  Doesn't leave me feeling heavy or bloated after consuming. \n",
      "corfetti!!!!! -- i like using 2 scoops of this and it is an incredibly thick, vanilla milkshake type texture..reminds me of the funfetti cupcakes from when i was a kid\n",
      "\n",
      "smores - has miniature marshmallow which is a cute/unique twist but i found them very hard on the teeth to crunch. the flavor is good, just not my favorite\n",
      "Cellucor is doing it big lately.  They are releasing all kinds of new flavors to their already solid lineup.   Here are my thoughts on 2 of the new flavors of Cor-Whey.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mint Chocolate Chip:  This one surprised me quite a bit.  I love this flavor.  When used in a shake, it taste almost identical to a Thin Mint girl scout cookie shake.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Cor-Fetti:  Cor-Fetti taste fantastic in a shake but really excelled for me when using it for cooking.  So far Cor-Fetti makes the best protein pancakes I have had to date.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability for both of these are fantastic.  Just like the other flavors in the Cor-Whey lineup, you can expect almost perfect mix ability with each flavor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Price:  Cellucor is always running deals for their protein.  It is usually B2G1 or they offer a crazy stack of 3 2 lbs tubs plus C4(or SuperHD) for right around 60 bucks.  Hard to beat that price.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are my thorough reviews with pictures on each:\n",

      "Product Presentation â The bottle is in a normal sleek jug with scooper. The only thing I didn't like was I felt there should be a mini packet in there to keep the powder dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste â For Mint chocolate chip, the flavor reminded me a lot of andes mints. The taste was smooth, creamy and the chocolate tasted well blended with the mint flavor. No worry of chunks getting stuck in your teeth on this one. It did have the same sweetness as the andes mints which tasted great to me, but could be a little intense for some. It was very easy to drink, almost like a mint chocolate chip milk shake you would get at Chick fil a. 9/10 \n",
      "For the smores, the flavor seemed most focused on the graham cracker flavor, with subtle chocolate and little marshmallow bits. This one also blended perfectly. The sweetness was more milder than the mint choc. chip and very easy to drink. It tasted like I would have expected if I threw some graham crackers and chocolate in a blender then added little marshmallows. For those that like to cook or drink more than shakes, I see a lot of potential with the smores. 9/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability â When the powder is still fine and almost looks like chocolate chip cookie dough whey. The smores looked like chocolate whey powder. They both mixed like a charm with minimal powder residue and minimal effort. A spoon or even swirling would mix the product well in water.  It blended with minimal effort. It practically mixed itself. Still 9/10\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Side Effects â Nothing out of the ordinary like with most wheys. I'm somewhat lactose intolerant so 1-2 scoops in a day does not phase me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Price âThe value per dose was average. I am more about cost effectiveness and best bang for the buck. When it can be had for about $30 per 2 lb jug, this will be my go to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results - The results were very consistent. It is the same as any other whey product except I have a little more wiggle room with my diet since the calorie per scoop is less than a lot of wheys.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The texture and flavoring of Cor Whey is phenomenal.  The new S'Mores has bits of graham cracker crumb and tiny marshmallows really setting this apart the flavoring is so on point,   is fantastic in water, almond milk and mixed in with strained yogurt.  The Cor-Fetti cake batter has a strong vanilla cake batter/icing like flavor and the tiny bits of sprinkles add a nice touch to this.  I highly recommend picking up Cor Whey some great protein.\n",
      "good profile..strawberry taste is awefull\n",

      "While s'mores wasn't my favorite flavor, I did still enjoy it and anyone that likes s'mores will love this flavor of protein! \n",
      "Mint chocolate chip, however, is my favorite flavor by far! I love mint chocolate chip ice cream, and was skeptical to see if cellucor could capture that flavor in this protein. Well, they did it, and I am thoroughly impressed with the result. Cor-whey is my favorite whey product and that won't be changing anytime soon.\n",
      "The buy 3 tubs + c4 was a really good deal so I had to get it. I bought the Cookies n' Cream, Strawberry Milkshake, and Whipped Vanilla. I don't think the CnC flavor is that great so the taste is 5/10 at best. I don't really care about the taste that much because protein is protein and Cellucor is a good company. I will continue to buy Cellucor protein if this deal is here to stay.\n",
      "Flavor reviews for Exclusive flavor Mint Chocolate Chip:\n",
      "Thanks Cory for selecting me to try this exclusive flavor sample. I mixed 2 servings I was surprised that it actually turned kinda green after mixing it in water.  I think the flavoring on this one was perfect. It tastes exactly like melted mint chocolate ice cream and i love mint chocolate ice cream! \n",
      "OMG! I absolutely love red velvet and since i'm always in prep, having red velvet ANYTHING is pretty much just a dream. The red velvet and smores both dissolves great (just like most of the other Cellucor Cor-Performance Whey products).  The red velvet tastes just like red velvet cake. The smores tastes great as well. Cellucor whey protein is one of my favorite go-to products and each time they come out with a new flavor, it never disappoints!\n",
      "I love the flavor varieties.  I have all of my shakes with 3/4- 1 cup almond milk. \n",
      "Cinnamon- I first ordered the cinnamon swirl. It's good, but the flavor is weak but sweet. I have to add a lot of cinnamon to actually taste like cinnamon swirl. This would be an awesome cinnamony milk with some cereal. \n",
      "Cake Batter- I got cake batter as a bonus when ordering the Cinnamon. It was really bad. \n",
      "S'mores- The s'mores is just okay, a muddled, weak chocolate. It does have bits of marshmallow and graham cracker which is a nice change of texture. But that in the background of the muddled base it is not that outstanding. I made sludge with it and it was a bit better than a straight shake.\n",
      "Red Velvet- Definitely the best tasting flavor. It has the strongest flavor so I did not have to add anything else besides milk or water. \n",
      "Cons- \n",
      "The ingredient list is short but on the negative, it has sucrose and even worse it has ace-k (acesulfame potassium). Which, if these things matter to you, is the most dangerous artificial sweetener. I wish the \"clean\" protein powder tastes as good as cellucor. \n",
      "Great taste !!!\n",
      "My girlfirend was using this for a while and swears by it. She brought me the vanilla one morning with breakfast and it was great so I picked up that and two other flavours and it is the best tasting protein I've had. I just ordered the mint chocolate and Cor-fetti this time around along with a casein as this is a fast acting protein. The girlfriend takes it because its low in calories if you care about that but I just take it for the taste and it works great. \n",
      "Tastes great and I definitely notice the difference from before I was taking protein. I would recommend to everyone\n",
      "Love this protein! Mixes great. Tastes great.  Only disappointment was the mint chocolate chip.. Maybe I was expecting too much from everyone's hype but honestly I hated it. I keep retrying it hoping to change my mind but no luck. The cinnamon swirl is great in oats or pancakes!  I like the pb marshmallow for a sweet shake. Definitely recommend giving them a try!\n",
      "I have been using protein powders for 10+years. I have never had any that taste a good as this entire line. The Strawberry is exceptional! The Mint Chocolate Chip tastes like Melted Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream from the bottom of your ice cream bowl! It is amazing!\n",

      "Tried Cellucor when it was on a screaming deal - Even without the deal - i think Cellucor is a good buy for a decent price.  I  got 3 flavors - I found that all the Cellucor whey mixed really well - the majority of the time it was mixed with water and it was dissolved quickly and had really good taste.  Great flavors - The Cinnamon Swirl smelt like Cinnamon Toast Crunch - but the taste wasn't as good as some of the other Cinnamon Bun or similar flavors by other companies. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Mint Chocolate Chip - tasted good - could really taste the mint in it and the little specs of chocolate chip were good.\n",

      "I have tried a couple Smores flavored proteins in my day, and was excited when I heard Cellucor was going to release their take on the flavor. As soon as I cracked it open I was hit with that nostalgic smell of camping from my childhood. The graham notes and highlighted by a strong, sweet smell of marshmallows and milk chocolate. It mixes instantly in water and tastes even more amazing in milk! I think I have found my new favorite protein. I can't wait to try it in a big bowl of proats!\n",

      "\n",
      "Strawberry Milkshake: Pleasantly surprised! Usually I hate all of the strawberry flavored powders but this one is a winner in my books. Not too sweet - mixes great with a hanful of blueberries or a banana post workout! I've used it in my oatmeal too - with a scoop of pb....winner!\n",
      "\n",
      "Whipped Vanilla: Typical vanilla - very versatile. This is a staple in my collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies and Cream: Had low expecations for this but I was wrong! Delicious.....with actual tiny peices of cookies! \n",
      "\n",
      "Cor-fetti Cake Batter: Delicious in oatmeal or protein pancakes/waffles. I can't stomach it just as a shake - WAY too sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mint Chocolate Chip - MY NEW FAVE! Cellucor has seriously won me over. My favorite \"mint chocolate chip\" USED to be Syntrax Matrix Whey in Mint Cookie. Cellucor's flavor is AMAZING. Not too sweet or minty - and you can still taste the chocolate chips. Im so glad I ordered two tubs!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucors Cor-Performance whey is by far my favorite protein powder. I have tried 7 flavors from this line and I really enjoyed most of them! The only one I disliked was the Cor-Fetti flavor. S'mores is so great with all the little pieces of graham cracker and chocolate and marshmallow! The very best flavor is Molten chocolate. This protein is now a staple in my diet. I would buy so many tubs of this if it wasn't for the sky high price on the canadian store. Looks like I'll have to stock up big time on the sales.\n",
      "The Mint Chocolate Chip tastes amazing!  I blend it with almond milk and a little ice and it's just like drinking a mint chocolate chip milkshake.  Where has this stuff been all of my life?  The red velvet cake batter is pretty tasty too, but the mint is hands down a favorite.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried a lot of different protein powders in the past, and I would have never thought protein powder could taste this good.  It also does an excellent job at keeping me full in between meals.  Finally - a protein shake I can get excited about!\n",
      "The COR-Performance Whey Protein by Cellucor contains great amounts of whey isolates and concentrates, added BCAA's, and INCREDIBLY low sugar amounts for the incredible tastes. I tried the cookies and cream flavor very recently.  Although coming across very sweet, it had a perfect texture, and a familiar favorite flavor.  Interestingly enough, it smells like straight up chemicals.  Good thing the taste doesn't reflect it.\n",
      "These two flavors moved to the top of my list in the Cellucor Line up! My previous favorite was PB Marshmallow but I think these two flavors (cor-fetti and smores) knocked it so far out of the park I can't even explain! Cor-fetti is very sweet and taste great in shakes and for baking! Smores is great for those as well but absolutely dominates any flavor I've ever had in the form of sludge!! Buy with confidence, these two flavors are killer!\n",
      "After trying about 6 other brands I gotta cay Cellucor is the best tasting, easiest to mix and thickest of all.  I was a big fan of Dymatize elite (and still am) but I think I like Cellucor more.\n",
      "My favorite protein hands down! I loveee the cake batter flavor! It's perfect for waffles lol I recently tried and fell in love with the s'mores flavor as well! It has tiny marshmallow pieces inside! The cinnamon flavor is delicious too! Those are my faves. They are thick and taste just like they should.\n",
      "I originally bought the stack because I needed protein powder and I wanted to tryout the C4. I was beyond impressed with the whey protein. I use it for cooking or a snack between meals. The cake is a little sweet to drank by itself but make amazing protein pancakes!  Cellucor  produces a great product! \n",
      "\n",
      "I have to agree with many other reviews for the COR-Fetti Cake Batter -- the taste is pretty bad. I was initially really excited to try out the flavor and have used it with water, with milk, in smoothies, and in protein pancakes. The flavor (as many others have said) tastes artificial and chemical-y, like a sugar-free dessert. The best way I've been able to eat them is in protein pancakes, for sure.\n",
      "I'm sure the ingredients are great, but if you want a whey protein with good flavor, don't do the cake batter.\n",
      "I just bought S'mores and Cinnamon Swirl, so I'll review those after I've tried them out. \n",
      "Fetti Cake Batter - to be honest I was a little disappointed with this one because of how much everyone talked it up in their reviews. I used it to make and it doesn't taste anything like cake batter the way people raved about. I don't care for it in a protein shake either. However I do enjoy it as a smoothie. Make with almond milk and ice it basically tastes like sugar free ice cream. I like to add 1 tablespoon of dark chocolate chips and for whatever reason it tastes like a frozen coffee drink and that's my favorite way of consuming this flavor! \n",
      "\n",
      "Strawberry Milkshake - I really enjoy this one. As a protein drink it kindof just taste like some strawberry and vanilla ice cream melted. It's really good. I also make this one in a smoothie form too. I use 1 scoop, vanilla almond milk, ice, and about 4 fresh strawberries to enhance the flavor. It's delicious! Would definitely recommend this one! \n",
      "\n",
      "They both mix really well and don't leave chunks. Both are great in smoothie form as well. Will definitely be trying other flavors.\n",
      "Mixes well with a good hard shake, didn't upset my sensitive stomach, and good protein ratio. However the taste and texture was pretty bad. The cake batter has little flavor at all, and is creamy like artificial creamers. Also a little watery for my liking. I would try other flavors. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is my favorite proteins!!  Many great flavors mixed in water or milk.  Mixed very well in shaker and blender...I will continue to buy this product!\n",
      "The Red Velvet Cake Batter flavour tastes amazing in unsweetened almond milk and in water, it is definitely my favourite. Cinnamon Swirl is pretty good too and it was great in pancakes. The Mint Chocolate Chip flavour is incredible, I'm currently taking it post-workout with water only and it tastes amazing. PB Marshmellow wasn't my favourite but it was still good overall. I take 1 scoop of cellucor whey with some dextrose after a CrossFit wod and I feel recovered shortly after so I know it's helping me. I will keep buying this brand it does not disappoint and having so many flavours to choose from is definitely a plus!!\n",
      "Red velvet cake batter tastes amazing. Just like a piece of cake. Absolutely delicious. Mixed well, and didn't feel like a brick sitting in my stomach either(some low quality protein powders will do that) and it was shipped super fast!! Ordered it on a Sunday and it was here Tuesday afternoon...thanks bb.com!!!!!\n",
      "Every flavor is amazing and is versatile for baking too!  I love all Cellucor products!!!!\n",
      "CNC flavor is great and mixes really well. My favorite Whey Protein so far.\n",
      "Molten Chocolate was disappointing though. \n",
      "I am an avid fan of ON Whey products. They are great tasting, mixes well with any kind of solvent, and clean ingredients. That was then, and this is now. I've tried a variety of Cellucor whey protein products, and I have to say that I am thoroughly surprised. It is a great product. Amazing taste, mixes well, reasonably priced, and no after taste. My least favorite thus far has been the red velvet. I find it too rich. My favorite flavor thus far? Cinnamon Swirl and Mint Chip. The peanut butter is also VERY good. All of them are good. It's hard for me to say which one is THE best because all of them taste great, it's just a matter of what you are in the mood for. Go grab some!\n",
      "I finally got in my Smores flavored whey.  It is delicious.  Definitely give it a try if you are thinking about it.  Make sure you give it a shake prior to each sip as it does have little chunks of graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmellow pieces.  Overall the Cellucor whey serious is excellent.  I have tried most of the flavors and have enjoyed them all (Red Velvet, Corfetti, Molten Choco, PB n Marshmellow, Cinn Swirl, and now Smores).  The profile is excellent.  The consistency is excellent.  It has become my go-to protein choice.  \n",
      "This protein is delicious!! I got the COR-fetti flavor and it was just like drinking a birthday cake milkshake. I also used it in my protein pancakes and they were the happiest pancakes ever!! I can't wait to try to other incredible flavors of this protein! A+++\n",
      "I love cellucors protein and options! The mint chocolate chip is delish as well as the cake batter. The cake batter has SPRINKLES!!! I'm pumped to try s'mores!!! \n",
      "Absolutely in love with this whey protein product. Although I have used proteins in the past with slight less calories and carbs, the flavors I have tried so far are completely worth the extra 20 cals or so. I mix the Cake Batter with almond milk, and it's literally a liquid confetti cake! :) The whipped vanilla is out of this world perfect, I usually use this during the day as a meal replacement when adding it to my protein pancakes, oatmeal, or blending it with coconut oil, bananas, oats and peanut butter :) It's absolutely perfect and WILL buy again. I'd also love to try all of the other flavors, too!\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely love the Mint chocolate chip flavor.  No disappointment in this one!! Freeze it and have some ice cream, I swear it taste just like the real deal!!! \n",
      "\n",
      "I have far too many of these tubs at my house currently and LOVE them all except for the cake batter. I bet it would make awesome pancakes though. Mint Chocolate Chip is definitely my favorite.\n",
      "LOVE the red velvet flavor, tastes like real red velvet cake batter. I use 1/2 scoop in my oatmeal and add a healthy cream cheese icing (fat free cream cheese, almond milk, and stevia) because what is red velvet without cream cheese ? ;)\n",
      "Cellucor has slowly become my main brand of whey protein. It blends really well, tastes great, and is so versatile. While I never use them with just water alone in a shaker bottle, these flavors are great in blended smoothies and protein pancakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a smoothie, can't go wrong with this whey, 1 cup of almond milk, spinach, and ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend thought the red velvet was great but while it's good, I didn't like it as much. He thought pbmarshmallow was too sweet but that's one of my favorites. It's all a matter of personal opinion, but you'll definitely find a good flavor from this brand.\n",
      "This is a fantastic protein option. It mixes easily and it makes a thick shake. I was hoping the cake batter flavour would live up to the hype and it blew me away. It was delicious! I would highly recommend this protein.\n",
      "Just tried the Mint Chocolate Chip whey recently and I love it! It is absolutely delicious even when mixed with water. Makes a fantastic protein ice cream! I would highly recommend this flavour and all Cellucor products. \n",
      "Taste 9/10: Tastes almost exactly like funfetti cake batter to me. Love it, and I like to nibble on the little colored \"sprinkles\" floating around. Taste is a little sweeter when mixed with milk, but still tastes great mixed with water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability/Texture 9/10: Not a single clump. A bit thicker with milk. Only reason I give it a 9/10 and not a 10 is a couple times the shake was a bit too thick and \"sticky\" when I made it with milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Made a few pancakes with it and they were great as well. Love seeing the \"sprinkles\" in em.\n",
      "This is AMAZEballs! I love Cor-Fetti! I can make the best donuts and pop tarts out of this one!\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!! I've never used any other brand and the options of flavors is amazing! I've tried the Cor-fetti cake batter, cookies n cream, strawberry, chocolate, cinnamon swirl, and peanut butter marshmallow. I still have more to try obviously but for just drinkng it as a shake I like the cake batter and cookies n cream. Didn't really care for the rest but the chocolate one i found I love to bake and make treats with it rather than drink it plain!\n",
      "This is definitely one of my favorites from Cellucor. I enjoyed drinking it as a shake post-workout, eating it with my oats in the morning and baking mug cakes with them. The possibilities are endless, not only because it tastes creamy, sweet and smooth, but also because it has colorful confetti that makes everything I bake or drink that much more exciting. \n",
      "Cellucor's COR-Performance Whey has absolutely the best flavors out there, not to mention that it's #1 among protein powders!\n",
      "Just finishing up my first container of the COR-fetti. I NEED MORE PRONTO! It has that vanilla flavor, but definitely not your plain ol vanilla! The bright colored confetti in it just makes you super happy!\n",
      "HAPPY PROTEIN!! Your muscles have a party! ;)\n",
      "Fantastic taste! Versatile use such as using it in a protein shake, creating amazing oatmeal, or using it to make recipes from the Protein Powder Chef. With 25 grams of protein per scoop and minimal carbs & fat, you will not be disappointed. \n",
      "I absolutely love this protein!! It's the best out there and would recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "Red Velvet is the most delicious whey protein i have ever tasted. It flavor creates a special mix of flavors that the finally tasting is really special. Plus its final composition is thick and easy to mix. Highly recommended. For makinf protein cookies is faboulous.\n",
      "I tried the Cellucor Mint Chocolate and it tasted amazing! I'm loving how Cellucor keeps coming up with these flavors!\n",
      "Cellucor is at it again making another incredible and delicious flavor of their COR-Performance.   You're going to be thrilled! I promise you the use of the protein does not stop at shakes but the application for cooking is endless!!! \n",
      "This Cor-Fetti Cake Batter flavor taste great! I've also had the Peanut Butter Marshmallow, Strawberry Milkshake (a favorite) and Whipped Vanilla too. When I first noticed this product was available, I knew I had to try it and I'm so glad I did! It reminds me of the Funfetti cake mix, which I still love to this day.! \n",
      "By far my favorite protein powder. It mixes so well and what love is that it still tastes good when mixed with water. Cooking with it is great also.\n",
      "This stuff tastes AMAZING!! Love all cellucor protein, would love to try the new Smore's flavor! \n",
      "To be honest this is a really good product. I am nuts about the Strawberry Milkshake, because... its taste as good if not better than a real strawberry milkshake. I mix it water is taste great, and even better for the full milkshake effect, almond milk and ice in my Nutribullet until foams up and BAM! I happy as school kid! *****\n",
      "\n",
      "The COR-Fetti Cake Batter is really good too. I like liquid cup cake frosting, even with the little frosting sprinkles texture in it. I'm even considering mixing an egg and some almond milk and throwing it in the microwave see if I can make cup cakes with it. That said the 9 is only for my taste, I dont have a huge sweets pallet for cakes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Peanut Butter Marshmallow is very very solid. It caters to your peanut butter craving....almost fully. Dont get me wrong its really good, its just missing....something. That being said, maybe its not a bad thing, because its AWESOME with I mix with a banana and chocolate whey! \n",
      "Mixes so easily and has all the essentials. Won't buy any other protein.\n",
      "For those who love this combination, the taste it is like the name said, I love this flavor with milk or water, is awesome\n",
      "Cellucor Mint Chocolate Chip is hands down the best protein powder I've ever had! I mix it with almond milk and ice cubes and it tastes just like ice cream!!! It's so delicious. It satisfies my sweet craving and I look forward to drinking it. If you haven't had it yet, you definitely need to try this one!\n",
      "I have used too many whey protein powders in the past few years to recall or count.  Cor-Whey from Cellucor is hands down one of the best.  Low calorie/High Protein, easy mixing, great for cooking, top notch taste (a ton of amazing flavors to choose from so don't be bashful order a few); but the over all results and gains with this product are the best part.  You can use it for cutting, you can use it for bulking and I even have close friends that are using this product to supplement meals with or without the added time in the gym.  I would s****est this product to anyone looking for a protein powder for any lifestyle or goal.\n",
      "I love protein but this has become one of my favorite. Cellucor never seems to disappoint and the Red Velvet Cake batter instantly became one of my favorites. From a shake, to making pancakes I highly recommend.\n",
      "Cellucor makes THE best flavors of whey protein powder. I've tried a great variety of brands and flavors, and I'm always happy and excited to use any of Cellucor's flavors. Peanut butter marshmallow was my favorite for a long period of time, but I recently just tried the Mint Chocolate Chip... It tastes exactly like the ice cream, particularly if you blend it with ice and whatever kind of milk you drink. I really hope this flavor sticks around for more than just a limited time!\n",
      "Peanut Butter Marshmallow was one of the best proteins that I have ever had!!!! Really good with milk! Cellucor is a reliable brand and I love their Performance Whey to make ALL KINDZ OF GAINZ!\n",
      "Excellent in almond milk. Actual chunks of graham cracker and what I think are actually chocolate pieces as well. Pretty versatile as well. Made delicious pancakes with peanut butter syrup & they were killer. A+ Cellucor.\n",
      "I take this whey every day pre workout and love it. The profile is great and it is some of the best tasting whey I've found. The Cookies N' Cream flavor is very good and I love the little cookie pieces in the powder. \n",
      "I tried the Corfetti flavor and it was great, tasted more like cake, than protein. As part of my post early morning work out shake I added strawberries to the Corfetti. Great taste. It was a sampler but this week I ordered 2) 2lbs. Containers it tastes great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great protein powder - good profile, great mixability, and the cinn swirl tastes GREAT. Red velvet was waaaay to rich though... I'm not sure what I expected but that wasn't it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll probably pick up some more at some point, I usually stick with Phase8 and chocolate/white chocolate but it's nice to mix it up with something a bit more exotic tasting once in a while.\n",
      "This tastes unbelievably good. Even at room temperature, the smores flavor is amazing. The powder (once you add water) actually creates little crumb sized marshmallows and Graham cracker. You'll see it when you rinse out your shaker cup. I can't wait to try to make protein brownies with this flavor!\n",
      "\n",
      "This taste amazing love it the only thing is I wish it had a 4 pound container \n",
      "Just when I thought Cellucor couldn't know me any better with the release of cor-fetti cake batter, they release mint chocolate chip! My favorite flavor of ice cream and they absolutely did it justice. Between the 2 and red velvet cake batter, Cellucor makes protein something to look forward to after workouts and cannot WAIT to try s'mores!!\n",
      "Great taste, best flavored protein I've had with water.\n",
      "This product is very tasty. It took a bit of getting used to, to try and find the right amount of water to use. For this I had it with about a cup of water or so to get the desired taste. I usually have over 500mL of water with my protein shakes just so it fills me up right. So this was the only \"not so con\" con. That being said, the other protein blends I have tried are full of fillers and cr@p, so that is why I can put so much water in my shake and still tasting good. This product has not even half as many fillers, so that is a good feeling knowing you are not just getting loaded with cr@p. There are other products that have more natural ingredients, but they don't have these exclusive flavors. It is good to get a treat for all the hard work we put in.  After all, we are in this to reach goals, so flavor does not really matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: I use these more to bake and make clean protein treats and they always come out delicious! I have made muffins, cheesecakes, cookies, pancakes, and pancake syrup with these. So good! All the new flavors taste incredible and rare! They all taste so authentic. I favor Red Velvet Cake Batter over the COR-fetti slightly though. Can't wait to try the newer flavors (S'mores, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, and Chocolate Raspberry Truffle).\n",
      "I am a consistent cellucor customer but I was unimpressed with the cake batter flavor. It just doesn't taste good compared to the other flavors. I gave the product a three for taste but the whole cellucor whey lineup gets an overall 9!. Great flavors and 25g of protein per scoop is a big plus!\n",
      "Gotta start by saying that CELLUCOR has killed it with COR-Performance Whey.  It's amazing how they've managed to create such a great-tasting protein with such a low calorie, fat, and carb content.  All this with 25g of protein per scoop, and you really can't beat COR-Performance. Now for the Mint Chocolate Chip flavor, it really does taste like a Mint Chocolate Chip milk shake. CELLUCOR continues to step up their game! And I look forward to new flavors that I'm sure will be great as well!\n",
      "This is one of the best tasting Whey protein I have had thus far.\n",
      "Very flavorful and not too sweet!  Great in just water (at least in my opinion).  I also use this protein in many recipes.  (Gotta love those protein waffles!!).  The flavors keep getting better and better so I won't say a favorite!\n",
      "Love the taste, not chalky or chemical tasting. loved it so much I ordered 2 other flavours getting delivered today!\n",
      "Cellucor comes out on top in taste, and consistently produces a great shake at one of the best values on Bodybuilding.com. Excellent protein with an excellent variety. Can't wait to sample every flavor.\n",
      "Excellent macros, excellent taste, easy on the stomach!\n",
      "Red velvet is my favorite to make waffles with! It cooks up great and tastes like my favorite cake!\n",
      "Mint Chocolate chip hands down is the best protein flavor from the best tasting protein brand I've ever tasted. Cor Fetti used to be my favorite, but Mint Chocolate chip takes it over. It really tastes like Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream or milkshake. Try it with Almond Milk.\n",
      "This is by far my favorite protein. It is a great value when bought with the c4 stack that is available here. It had a good profile and some of the flavors are great. My favorite protein flavor is definitely the new mint chocolate chip. It tastes just like the ice cream. The only flavors that I did not like were the peanut butter marshmallow (too sweet for my tastes, but some of my friends liked it) and strawberry I could not even finish.  I am definitely stocking up on the chocolate mint since it replaced my favorite flavor of molten chocolate. You can't go wrong with this protein! \n",
      "Cor-fetti is one of my favorite flavors of Cellucor Whey! Cellucor whey is fantastic to bake with (pancakes, protein bars, muffins)...The texture is amazing for mixing into recipes, and all the flavors are absolutely divine (I used Cinnamon Swirl in my protein french toast the other day and was blown away).\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Cor-fetti, it's definitely a staple in my pantry now. Not only does it taste like birthday cake, but it's got a gorgeous color with rainbow sprinkles in it, which is just the icing on the cake. I use this product and flavor every day post-workout by mixing a scoop of Cor-fetti into my oatmeal. The texture and flavor are divine and I feel like I'm eating a post-workout funfetti cake! Definitely a must-have, especially for baking\n",
      "I was so excited when Cellucor came out with the Cor-Fetti cake batter flavor! I love having a variety to choose from in my protein flavors, and was excited to have another option to add to the list! This is BY FAR my new favorite whey protein flavor! It's not too sweet or rich, it is just perfect when mixed with milk or almond milk - creates just the right consistency and flavor! Definitely my favorite way to \"cheat clean!\" \n",
      "This stuff is on point! Tastes exaclty like red velvet cake! I look forward to it or any of the other flavors each day/night! Cor-fetti cake batter is just as amazing. I wont buy any other protein ever again! \n",
      "The taste of this powder is great! It reminds me of a McDonald's shamrock shake but better. This is actually my first taste of cellucor's line of whey protein, and I am thoroughly impressed. It's easy to mix. For those counting, fats are low and there is just a few more grams protein per serving with Cellucor than some other popular brands. I'm very sold on the taste though. If one new product, definitely try their line. \n",
      "I absolutely love all of Cellucor's COR-Performance Whey flavors! They all mix really well in a shake and are also amazing in protein desserts. Out of all of the flavors I've bought (Peanut butter marshmellow, strawberry milkshake, Cinnamon swirl, and COR-fetti cake batter), Cake batter is definitely top on my list. It is the perfect amount of sweet and tastes just like the real thing. The sprinkles in it are a fun added touch too! Can't wait to try more flavors. Cellucor never disappoints. Great flavor and more importantly, great results!\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I use it for protein shakes as well as using it to bake with! I have at least 6 different flavors and love them all!\n",
      "This line of protein powders is awesome and tastes so good. The red velvet tastes amazing even just mixed with water!  Definitely gotta try the rest now. \n",
      "I have tried EVERY flavor they make for this and also hear of two of my ABSOLUTE favorite flavors coming down the pipe (Cookie dough and S'mores)  I really enjoy the nutritional profile of this protein and the price bodybuilding.com keeps it at is AMAZING.  PB Marshmallow, Cinnamon Swirl, Strawberry Milkshake, and Red Velvet are all my go-to flavors.  I use them all in my daily shakes, and the pb or Red Velvet in my protein pancakes (1/2 a cup of quick oats blended up to flour, scoop of protein, almond milk, and egg whites til the consistency creates a batter..very simple).  Cellucor makes wonderful products and I will continue to buy them as a normal staple to my healthy lifestyle! \n",
      "Cellucor makes the best whey protein! Mint Chocolate Chip is my new favorite flavor. Tastes exactly like mint chocolate chip ice cream when mixed with milk! Cellucor always has the best flavors and I hope to try S'Mores next!\n",
      "This is the best protein flavor I have ever had, second to cellucor cinnamon swirl! I could drink this daily and never get tired of the flavor. makes amazing sludge and protein ice cream and is perfect with almond milk as well! noticeable gains compared to other proteins. \n",
      "\n",

      "Really great taste! Mixes well with water or milk! Favorite brand of protein (:\n",
      "This ishould by far my favorite protein powder. It tastes amazing it mixes well have gained some serious muscle from the powder. The Cor-fetti cake batter is the best tasting protein on the market.I highly recommend it to everybody.\n",
      "the Cor-fetti is seriously my fav flavor of protein and ive tried a ton....it mixes well with water milk even Greek yogurt or ricotta cheese!! \n",
      "The only protein I will order now. It's so good, settled well on my stomach and can used for baking... I use it every morning for \"protein waffles\" yum! :) \n",
      "Absolutely Love this product.  Only protein I use anymore and have had amazing results while taking it, both losing and gaining weight.  Seems to be an excellent protein powder and all of the flavors are truly amazing but the best in my opinion is the Red Velvet Cake Batter.  It tastes like chocolate wrapped in cake dipped in sugar but is oh so good.  I mix it everyday with oatmeal for a shake and have it after my workout.  Will definitely continue to buy this for a long time.\n",
      "Very sweet, but otherwise no complaints.  I will definitely buy this again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: I've bought several tubs of this awesome stuff since my first purchase, as well as trying other brands. I keep coming back to Cellucor. Most of the flavors taste awesome and mix well. Peanut Butter Marshmallow and Strawberry Milkshake are by far my favorites.  Molten chocolate is a close second, especially when mixed with almond milk and peanut butter.  Cinnamon Swirl was way too sweet but I enjoy it in baked goods.  The only flavor that I haven't liked Is Cor-Fetti Cake Batter.  I could not get past the chemically taste of artificial sweeteners. I realize the other flavors are artificially sweetened also, but it was unbearable in the Cor-Fetti. The taste was just terrible.  I'm hesitant to try the other new flavors, but might have to take a risk and order some S'mores!\n",
      "This is the best tasting cake batter protien I have ever taken, you can taste the sprinkles and everything! \n",
      "This is my go-to coffee creamer, mug cake, protein shake, protein pancake, my go to everything you can make!! This stuff not only packs 25g per serving protein, it's freaking delish!!  No bad after taste, it's just amazing that protein powder can taste THIS GOOD! I love all the flavors, I don't know if I could pick a favorite!! \n",
      "Cellucor Whey is by far the best tasting whey I have had. I really feel as if the quality of this product helps aid my recovery much better than some lower quality products I've used in the past. Cookies N' Cream is probably my favorite flavor. I got the new Mint Chocolate Chip shortly after it came out and it is a close second! WIth milk, it tastes just like a melted mint chocolate chip ice cream cone. LOVE IT\n",
      "I bought this flavor from Cellucor's website when they were doing the special for being recently released. The flavors are AMAZING! Profile is good and can't go wrong with this protein for any use. By far some of the best tasting protein powders on the market.  You can bake anything with it, the texture is spot on for powders!  Flavors are crazy good! Mint Chocolate Chip is like having a bowl of ice cream and Red Velvet is like eating cupcakes.  Cellucor killed it with with these two flavors! Profile is on point, CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS PROTEIN!!\n",
      "Cellucor has done a great job with their COR-performance whey series. The Mint Chocolate Chip flavor is by far one of my favorites. Mixed into a shake, it tastes just like Mint Chocolate Chip Ice cream. \n",
      "I've taken the Cellucor Whey for about two years now and it's by far my favorite. The flavors are amazing and I decided to give the new COR-fetti a try. It's just as delicious as the rest of the flavors. If you like Funfetti cake at all, you'll LOVE this stuff.\n",
      "Both of these flavors are delicious and mix well with shakes and food recipes. I have seen almost instant results with this line of products\n",
      "for the macros you cannot beat it, and especially when on sale with buy one get one 50% off\n",
      "\n",
      "10/10 for quality and mix\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste:\n",
      "molten chocolate - 8/10\n",
      "cinnamon swirl - 10/10 - best ever\n",
      "confetti cake batter - 7/10 its okay\n",
      "red velvet- very let down 6/10\n",
      "pb marshmallow- 10/10 best ever tastes like a butter finger\n",
      "After a very long search and testing out many different protein powders, I finally found Cellucor and I instantly became obsessed! So many great flavour options and the powders mix very well/are very versatile. I use these powders to make mug cakes, pancakes, cookies, muffins, proats and occasionally I use them the \"traditional\" way and make a shake with almond milk. There's also nothing super disgusting in the ingredients which puts my mind at ease, since other protein powders I've tried had \"corn syrup solids\" and other weird things listed in the ingredients, which I try to avoid at all costs. So far I've tried the following flavours:\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl: Probably the most versatile flavour I've tried. Mixes very well into everything and tastes delicious.\n",
      "COR-Fetti Cake Batter: Great for making mug cakes, this actually tastes like the real thing!\n",
      "Mint Chocolate Chip: Works best as a shake and I've been meaning to mix this with frozen blended banana to make ice cream. Has a slight after taste and isn't as versatile a flavour since I usually make mug cakes, pancakes and oats with my powder, but I still enjoyed it.\n",
      "Red Velvet Cake Batter: Red velvet cake is a personal favourite of mine, so I have a soft spot for this flavour. Very delicious!\n",
      "Peanut Butter Marshmallow: At first I wasn't digging this flavour very much when I got it since the peanut butter flavour isn't THAT prominent (although it smells very strong). If I mix it with PB2, this is absolutely perfect and this powder makes a great peanut butter mug cake.\n",
      "S'mores: SOON! Will be arriving any day now!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh goodness! Where to even begin! When opening the tub the the unexpected smell of vanilla and cake filled the air. At first I thought it was going to be far too sweet for my liking but it was amazing! By itself it is great but I also use it in overnight oats or protein pancakes which come out fantastic! The consistency is smooth and creamy as many protein powders are dry and chalky! This is by far my favorite flavor as of now compared to the other cellucor proteins!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not bad but not great either. Taste was ok but this stuff is thick compared to something like Gold Standard, you have to add more water and shake it pretty we'll to get a consistent mixture. \n",
      "I have tried many different proteins, and they all fell short for me. Whether it was the flavor, mix ability, or price I just wasn't quite satisfied. Then I decided to try Cellucor's Cor-fetti  cake batter, and I must say...WOW! Amazing smell once you open the tub, and the taste is absolutely wonderful! It is a little thick, but you get used to it. As far as price...you get what you pay for.. If you want a high quality protein with a great profile, then Cellucor is the way to go! I highly recommend this protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just purchased this protein and was really excited for it to get here, I wanted to try it out! I just literally finished drinking it and I honestly have to say, it is the best protein shake I have ever had. I can't wait to cook pancakes and other various goodies with this!\n",
      "\n",
      "(I have had MetRX, MHP, Optimum, Designer Whey, Javapro prior to this).\n",
      "I don't usually write reviews, but I was blown away withthe taste of this! I'm usually a regular vanilla fan due to indgredient profile being more important than taste and not a wide selection when i first was bit by the bodybuilding bug. I stuck with my go-to until I saw this bogo sale and said \"why not?\" BEST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE!! It mixed so easy, and has such a great profile that i feel great about drinking this (what i would have thought was a big cheat drink had i not known it was a protein drink). I love Cellucor's Super HD and CKL, and my boyfriend loves their C4. One more reason to add to our big list of why we are huge Cellucor fans. Thank you for another great product!! Keep up the great work Cellucor!!\n",
      "Cellucor whey protein is my favorite brand by far. Cinnamon swirl is life changing. The smell and taste is soooo good and tastes amazing mixed in with things like yogurt and oatmeal! Mint choco chip tastes like ice cream and helps fight cravings (especially when put in a shake). Chocolate is OK-nothing special, and vanilla is just vanilla. I have never been unhappy with a cellucor purchase! Also, good prices, good sales and great customer service on bodybuilding.com's part. \n",
      "\n",
      "In LOVE with my cellucor powders! I've got 3 flavors so far and am addicted to my cor-fetti cake batter the most followed by cookies & cream & red velvet. These are definitely keeping my sweet tooth satisfied during figure prep! \n",
      "This protein tastes like a liquified cinnamon roll! It tastes amazing, there no fizz when you mix it up, and it mixes so well that you could do it with a spoon. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great protein. Great supplement with a great taste.\n",
      "I am in love with this protein! Cellucor never fails to come out with the best products and hit a home run with this one. It has 25g of protein which helps recovery and builds solid muscle. I noticed my best results with this one. It also tastes amazing: chocolate is my favorite. I would definitely recommend to anyone!\n",
      "I have been buying this Whey for about the last 6 months when they do there buy 2 get 1 free offer. I recently purchased the mint chocolate chip one and was blown away. This protein powder mixes super easy, The only time it will get chunky on you is if you mix it with ice cold water. I recommend mixing it with Luke warm or cold water and then adding a few ice cubes to make it colder if desired. If you are looking to satisfy a desert craving I highly recommend you add a scoop or 2 in a blender with a cup or so of milk and several ice cubes and mix together. It is just like having a mint shake from Dairy Queen. TRY IT NOW!!!! \n",
      "\n",
      "This protein is definitely one of the better tasting proteins (especially strawberry) and mixed very well with either water or milk, will definitely buy again! \n",
      "Doesn't really taste like the milk after a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch. I fell for that and I regret buying this product because it's not even half gone since I don't want to take it due to horrible taste\n",
      "\n",
      "LOVE this protein! Have only tried 2 flavors, but peanut butter marsmallow is awesome.\n",
      "The corfetti cake batter is a bit on the sweet side, but tastes good too. Will buy again.\n",
      "I have tried several flavors and all of them are very good and it works well\n",
      "Cellucor has always delivered when it comes to taste, and I knew Red Velvet Cake Batter would be no different! I have had many ask me, \"Doesn't it just taste like chocolate?\" and the answer is no! \n",
      "\n",
      "Upon opening the tub, just the smell alone triggers thoughts of Red Velvet Cake. It's spot on with smell and flavor. I am a long time fan of Cellucor COR-Performance whey protein, so I already knew it would mix well. I usually do not drink protein shakes. Instead, I bake with protein or mix it with Greek Yogurt. This protein bakes well and is not clumpy when mixed with yogurt. It does not leave a gritty and dry taste, you simply get the flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "I give this flavor 10/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for something different than your standard Chocolate and Vanilla!\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever came up with the idea to put sprinkles in protein powder is a genious!  I love drinking, baking, and cooking with this protein so much more than any other I've ever tried.  Its great in mug cakes, pancakes, shakes, and even waffles.  It tastes dead on to confetti cake batter youre used to from being a kid and you dont feel guilty about eating it.  Its a little on the sweet side and for some thats a down fall.  I mix it with a little vanilla to curb the sweetness and its perfect for me.  I love getting the bits of sprinkles from the bottom of the shaker bottle, its like the toy in a box of cereal.  Mixes very smoothly and does not clump up at all!\n",
      "I recently received cor-fetti whey in my BB.com order. Initially, I used the product in a shake of just water, as I usually do. This allows me to taste the true product without any spin on the flavor. I found it to be a bit sweet for my liking. I also thought this of the PB Marshmallow.\n",
      "BUT, upon using it in some baking/cooking recipes, I found the flavor to be really solid. I made Cor-fetti pancakes and they were OUTSTANDING!!! \n",
      "The Cor-whey series is very easy to cook with and there truly is a flavor profile for everyone. \n",
      "My only gripe is that in a shake, the flavors can taste a bit artificial and chemically, but on the whole, I really enjoy this series of product. \n",
      "Keep up the good work Cellucor!!!!!!\n",
      "Purchased a 2lb Tub of Cellucor's Cor Performance Red Velvet Cake Batter whey and have been using it for a while. Below are my thoughts on this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nutrition: Like the rest of the Core Performance Whey Series, this whey has a great profile. 25 Grams of protein, with isolates being the main source. It is also low on fat with only 1.5 grams and relatively low carbs (especially for the great flavor) at 3 grams (with one of that being fiber). Total calories are 130.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability: Zero issues with mixing this in a shaker cup. My first shake i used 12 oz of water with 2 scoops of whey. Consistency was perfect and i had zero clumps/ unmixed product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: Taste is not bad. Not what I expected, but not bad. I will occasionally mix it with water or milk if I am in a hurry, but mostly it gets mixed with Red Velvet Cake mix and water to make a protein post workout cake. This flavor may not appeal to everyone. It is not my favorite Cellucor flavor, but it has been a good change from the normal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this is a very solid product. I enjoyed a different taste and personally would rate it as my fourth favorite Cellucor flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall score 7.5/10 \n",
      "Cellucor has done it again with flavoring for the newer mint chocolate chip!!! I've had it two different ways. \n",
      "\n",
      " As a shake. Taste and mixing are a 9 out of 10!! \n",
      "  Taste is very similar to that of a thin mint cookie but not as much of the chocolate flavor which would be my only neg towards it. It mixes smooth but sometimes clumps it the mouth of my shaker.\n",
      "\n",
      " Mixed in yogurt is amazing!! Tasted exactly mint chocolate chip soft serve ice cream!! It has been my go too for a late night meal!! \n",
      "Another solid flavor from the folks at Cellucor. Cor-Whey is in my staple when it comes to getting my daily protein intake. This particular flavor I have to say was pretty good and I loved the little fetti pieces. Mixed up very well in a shaker cup with minimal effort and no clumps. The ingredient profile is excellent and this protein can be used in baking, sludge recipes, etc. I have tried almost all of the flavors Cor-Whey has to offer and while Fetti Cake Batter isn't my favorite I wouldn't pass it up if it was offered to me. I would highly reccommend this protein for anyone looking for solid flaovoring and ecellent ingredient profile. \n",
      "I absolutely love the taste and mixibility of this flavor.  After purchasing it with my own $, I was blown away with how well it mixed and tasted in water, milk, almond milk, and pancakes/waffles.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "The Cake Batter is just okay. A lot of people say it smells and tastes JUST like cake, but it really doesn't. It has an artificial taste to me. I can't drink it straight... I have to make a smoothie out of it. If it's in a smoothie, it tastes yummy! But by itself... yuck. I just ordered PBM, Molten Chocolate, and Cinnamon Swirl. Hopefully those don't have any nasty aftertastes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Please hear me out. The peanut butter marshmallow is ridiculous. I felt obligated to let everyone know this. I only mix my shakes with water and it took taste to another level. I previously crowned syntha 6 as king of flavor but this is great with far less carbs, calories and fat. I was an optimum guy but I'm convinced.  This is king.  #levels \n",
      "This protein is good. I probably wouldn't get the cinnamon swirl again. It taste good, but it's a little too sweet for an everyday protein.\n",
      "Over all, not bad. Flavor wise, I do not recommend the Peanut Butter Marshmallow, it tastes like old peanuts and artificial sweetener.\n",
      "Delicious! The only thing I wish that they listed is the Amino Acid Profile. Red Velvet is amazing and great in shakes and pancakes!\n",
      "So good! Love this product. Can be a little difficult to get all mixed up but it taste amazing!\n",
      "Taste is one of the best I have ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love love love this flavor.  So many times powder flavors have a chemical after taste to me and I never finish the tub...but this one I always finish.  It's great first thing in the morning mixed with just water...even better mixed with milk or almond milk.  Great for after workouts and snacks.  I love all the Cellucor whey products but when it comes to taste, this one is the best.  \n",
      "I seriously love this protein. I mix the chocolate w/ a little water, and pour on top of my hot oatmeal in the AM -- so awesome. I also will mix it w/ coconut milk and ice in my vitamix and then freeze for an hour or two -- totally tastes like soft serve chocolate icecream. LOVE! Choco mint is also amazing.\n",
      "Best tasting protein I've had yet. Each flavor tasted great especially the cinnamon swirl. Vanilla was the best tasting vanilla I've had but still not quite on point. May be slightly more expensive than ON when buying one at a time but well worth it. The best deal is the stack with PWO. Comes out much cheaper than any ON deal.\n",
      "This protein has top notch taste! I have tried a few MusclePharm proteins and this blows them out of the water. \n",
      "Was excited to try a new protein, very disappointed with this flavor! Yuck! \n",
      "\n",
      "I have used cellucor whey protein for the past two years. ( super sport )  the new formulation is good with many new flavors, still mixes well. But I liked the super sport better. I will stick with the Cor-Performance Whey  and give it a chance. I have tried a lot of other whey protein products and there are a lot that are not good ( taste, mixing, and performance )  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great protein overall with excellent proportional composition. MY favorite flavors are incredibly palatable as well! Peanut Butter Marshmallow is possibly the best I've ever had. Great flavor, not overly sweetened, easy to get down quick or enjoy it as a high protein snack with a splash of Milk. Mint chocolate chip tastes a little chemically sweetened to me and similar to melted ice cream, so i's hard for me to get this down post-workout. Not only do I feel like i'm cheating when I'm not, but its just too flavorful. Some people may like that, I can't really tolerate it. \n",
      "Long time fan of the Old Original Metrx Choclate Packet flavoring.  This is stop notch. \n",
      "Use for my post shake; so far so good. Tastes excellent could drink it all day long.. \n",
      "I've tested almost EVERY flavor of this (excluding CnC), and have enjoyed every one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their ingredient profile is terrific.\n",
      "Great protein product with NO FILLERS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is second to none.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a quality product. I just unfortunately tried a flavor that I felt was terrible. Take that with a grain of salt as every persons taste buds are different. I wish they had more flavors in sample size so I could give another flavor a try. The Cor-Fetti cake batter flavor did mix well with water and I only used a spoon to mix. \n",
      "I am a bikini competitor and I am constantly craving sweet things. Today, I received my package and I am very pleased with Cellucor's protein. If you have a sweet tooth, I recommend you to try the red velvet cake batter.  It is very tasty! I normally add Ice, 30 calorie almond milk and splenda. It really makes amazing protein shakes! \n",
      "This is by far the easiest mixing protein powder I've ever used: no clumping and even mixes easily with a fork! I've only just started using the product, so I can't comment on its effectiveness, but assuming the protein content is accurate, it should do as good a job as other quality powders. I've also noticed it takes a lot less water to get a good mix; not really sure what that means, though, but I like it. It keeps me from feeling too full immediately before and after a workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "The cinnamon swirl is the best tasting flavour I've ever had (I've been taking protein powders since 1996). Blended with a banana is so good, I'd drink it for the taste alone. \n",
      "So far, my favorite is the COR-fetti Cake Batter. The Red Velvet is good too. My least fav is the Peanut Butter Marshmallow because it doesn't really taste like the name but Cellucor is one of my fav protein powders.\n",
      "FREAKIN AWESOME! taste, texture everything! By far the best protein powder and worth the money!\n",
      "Just finished my first 4 lb tub of Cinnamon Swirl and must say its hands down the best tasting whey protein I've ever used. Mixes very well in both milk and water. Can see the gains already. Looking forward to trying their other flavor options. Must buy!\n",
      "I tried pretty much every flavor, except the vanilla and strawberry, and they all are pretty good.  I was not all impressed with the cake batter (tasted like vanilla protein.)  My top 3 flavors are the mint chocolate chip (taste almost like the ice cream), cinnamon swirl (with almond milk), than probably PB marshmallow.  I like to bake with protein powder and am always please to how things turn out when I use cellucor!  \n",
      "I really like this protein. I have tried four flavors adn have been really impressed by all of them . It mixes really well and i like how thick it is with the right amount of water. all on all i will keep coming back to this protein.\n",
      "Great protein powder.  Mixes up super easy.  Filling and satisfying after a workout.  Mint chocolate chip is tastes perfect- needs to be made a standard flavor.  Not too sweet but helps when that chocolate craving comes around.  Cinnamon Swirl is a little too sweet some days, but flavor is still on point, would be interested in making protein pancakes & do other cooking with it.\n",
      "Holy **** this is the sweetest protein I've ever had in my life. I have a sweet tooth, but this stuff is kind of absurd. The Cake Batter flavor was terrible&Peanut butter marshmallow tasted bad at first but I sort of got used to it. It was way better than the Cake Batter anyway. Would not recommend this protein.\n",
      "I love this protein! I love peanut butter so this flavor is just perfect! It's thick, creamy and delicious. I drink it alone, mix it in smoothies, add some chocolate, make mug-cakes - everything! Definitely recommend it if you are a peanut butter lover.\n",
      "Tried most proteins on the market. Cellucor Cor-Performance is definitely my new favorite and go to protein.\n",
      "For shakes this whey is perfect, mixes instantly with no clumps.\n",
      "The true strength of this line comes from cooking and baking with it, also perfect when combining it with Greek Yogurt\n",
      "\n",
      "Cor-Fetti, Peanut Butter , and Molten Chocolate are the best i have had flavor wise out of others similar to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl tastes exactly like a cinnamon bun.\n",
      "\n",
      "These Proteins are a must, especially when Cellucor runs deals so frequently \n",
      "I bought the Peanut Butter Marshmallow whey because it had the 2nd highest taste rating and because the combination sounds spectacular. But I tried downing it and I have to say it was the most disgusting protein I have purchased. I usually have no problem just downing shakes, but the taste was unbearable for me. I ended up giving it away.\n",
      "It did mix well, so Im not doubting its high quality. I just dont see how the flavor got such a high rating. GROSS!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the best tasting whey mixes I've ever tried! Cellucor nailed it on this one! I love mixing it into my oatmeal in the morning or making protein pancakes with it! \n",
      "This is one of the best tasting whey mixes I've ever tried! Cellucor nailed it on this one! I love mixing it into my oatmeal in the morning or making protein pancakes with it! \n",
      "Great choice of protein. All the flavors are great, but you better stock up on the birthday confetti cause that is just amazing! \n",
      "Chocolate tastes great. Mixes easily and can't beat the B2G1 deal. \n",
      "I LOVE the mint chocolate chip flavor. Mixes perfectly with water with a creamy smooth texture (as if you mixed with milk). Just sweet enough to get me through a craving. \n",
      "I have tried 4 other proteins from other brands and this is the only flavor I can drink with out having a reflex to puke.. This is absolutely Awesome and especially amazing in protein pancakes. Can't wait to try more of cellucor\n",
      "Great whey protein supplement.  It mixes well and taste great.  It cost a bit more than the ON whey protein, but the Cellucor flavors are superior.  I've tried several of the Cellucor COR-Performance flavors and they are all really good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If there was one gripe I had, it would be that its a little too thick.  I guess you could thin it by adding more liquid, but Cellucor could use a little less thickeners (gums) in the mix.  \n",
      "This product is very good. The cinnamon swirl is awesome. The peanut butter marshmallow is good, but hard to taste any sign of marshmallow, and the cake batter is ok. This protein doesn't mix up as well/tastes as good as MusclePharm's Combat Powder, but it is a cheaper alternative that works well. I bought the stack with 3 (2lb tubs) of protein, and 1 (30 serving) C4. This stack is out right awesome for $74.99! You figure the C4 is $29.99, so you get 6lbs of protein for $45! You really can't beat that deal if you like C4 as much as I do. If you haven't tried C4, pink lemonade and watermelon are the best flavors IMO. \n",
      "This is my go to protein powder! Best one on the market! Cellucor's products never fail to impress me with their quality as well as their flavors! This protein powder mixes well & tastes amazing! I use it for post-workout mixed with water in my oats, in protein pancakes and in my cottage cheese! The cake batter flavor was my least favorite. I liked the sprinkles in it, but the flavor was far too sweet. The red velvet was surprisingly very similar to the cake batter, however this flavor tastes amazing in protein pancakes; just not on it's own. The molten chocolate is so good! It has a rich, thick chocolatey flavor. I LOVE this flavor in anything! I left the best for last, peanut butter marshmallow! Anything peanut butter is amazing, but  this protein blows me away! It tastes SO GOOD! I use this flavor so much it's ridiculous! Cellucor is hands down the best brand for any product! \n",
      "Like the flavors and mixes well, good amount of protein per serving. Would definitely recommend. \n",
      "This Whey tastes awesome ! The cookies & cream flavor is underrated, it's absolutely AMAZING !  I tried a lot of different proteins: Iso 100, Combat, Hydro, Isopure, Phase 8... and with no doubt this is the best tasting protein i've ever tried (even with water), plus it mixes perfectly well and have a very good nutrition profile !  I'll definitely stick with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using Cellucor for at least 6 months now.  Love the flavors and how nicely it mixes, esp. in my bodybuilding.com shaker cup.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought both the COR-Fetti and Red Velvet, have not tried Red velvet yet. Tried mixing the COR-Fetti with water and it was awful, then mixed with milk and it turned out so much better. As close to the real thing as you're going to get in a protein shake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Update:The Red Velvet tastes like chocolate cake. Not bad but not what I expected. Not a chocolate protein fan.\n",
      "I have been buying this product for the past couple of years, it has by far the best taste compared to other protein powders I have tried.  I am extremely happy with the quality and results I have seen with this product.   \n",
      "I've never in my life done a review for anything but holy s***! This mint chocolate chip powder is HEAVEN! It tastes just like the ice cream!\n",
      "For sure buying this one again!\n",
      "Been ordering this product since it came out and by far one of the best Ive ever had. It mixes good and taste pretty good nothing bad to say about this product \n",
      "Product mixed pretty well in my blender with milk. Peanut Butter Marshmallow wasn't bad, kind of reminded me of Rocky Road ice cream. Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mint Chocolate Chip is on another level!\n",
      "9.5 rating for mint chocolate chip? You all have lost your sense of taste. The artificial sugar taste makes me want to gag with every drink milk or water. The powder itself is good. Mixes great but this flavor starts good but after a while its NASTY....hoping cinnamon swirl or peanut butter marshmallow tastes less artificial.  \n",
      "This is my second time ordering this protein, and it is a great protein. It has a good nutrition profile, not very high in carbs or calories, so it is a good protein to cut with if you don't want to spend the extra money on a isolate protein. The Mint is my favorite flavor, it is a little thick with 5 oz of water, which was okay with me, because it makes it seem to have more of a full feeling to me. It mixes very well also, so you don't have the clumps stuck in the bottom.\n",
      "LOVE this product!  Hands down the best tasting protein on the market.. and it's lean!\n",
      "I just tried the cinnamon swirl today and I must say it is pretty awesome! it tastes good in a shaker with water and also mixes really well! I am impressed and will be buying other flavors now!\n",
      "I like cellucor protein, it mixes well and has a good consistency.  I was excited about cake batter but was horrible. I wouldn't order it again but have a tub I need to use still....taste is hidden in the protein pancakes. \n",
      "\n",
      "******The peanut butter marshmallow and whipped vanilla are my favourite and would definitely order those again. \n",
      "I bought the Red Velvet Cake Batter flavor and it didn't exactly taste like what I was hoping for but it did taste good. It mixes really easy and has 25g for protein per serving. I recommend it!\n",
      "Cellucorâs performance whey is currently my favorite choice of protein.  They have a great array of flavors.  I have tried their molten chocolate, cinnamon swirl, birthday cake, peanut butter marshmallow and Cellucorâs newest flavors red velvet & mint chocolate chip and they are all excellent.  Of course I have my favorites: I like to make my protein pancakes with red velvet, sprinkle cinnamon swirl in my oatmeal, and simply drink the molten chocolate, but thatâs just me.  If you like to bake or cook with your proteins they are great for that.  As far as the nutrients it has an awesome 25g of protein per scoop with minimal carbs (about 3 carbs per scoop).  I would highly recommend Cellucorâs performance whey proteins.  \n",
      "After looking at reviews and comparing labels I  bought this protein to use with a non flavored mono creatine. I have to say I got it right the first time. This is the only Whey I've used and the only one Im gonna buy. Im happy with my gains and I love the taste of the Molten chocolate. Mixed with water taste just like choc milk. \n",
      "The downsides to these flavors is the mix-ability because if you have water already inside your bottle the protein just sticks there and its hard to come off. Its like you gotta put the protein inside your shaker cup or blender (if making a delicious shake) first before you put any wet product (water,etc.). Overall the taste from the Molten Chocolate had a little bit of salt taste to it which I found fascinating. Peanut butter Marshmallow is like melted marshmallow mixed with peanut butter, and Cinnamon swirl is out of this world! its like cinnamon toast crunch even the container reeks of the cinnamon that's inside the powder itself.\n",
      "All I have to say is WOW! This protein powder left me speechless. I LOVE all of Cellucors protein powder flavors but this one knocked me on my butt. It was creamy and rich and had little chocolate bits in it too. It turned a little green which I thought was awesome. The amount of flavor this has with Almond Milk is not like any other protein powder that I have tried. It tastes just like Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream. I really like the Dymatize Chocolate Mint flavor protein powder, but this one even tops that! Take advantage of the Buy 2 get 1 Free Promo and get 2 of these and 1 of another flavor. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to EVERYONE! It is not too sweet as you would imagine it to be. What are you waiting for?! Go Order it Now :) Thank you Cellucor for NEVER disappointing <3\n",
      "The cinnamon swirl is amazing! The strawberry doesn't mix very well and before you mix it it smells like feet.  The peanut butter and marshmallow is good too but when I reorder it will be only cinnamon swirl.\n",
      "Great price for the money. The stacks are a no brainer. Lean an clean. Just wish it had BCAA's. \n",
      "I've been using this product for 6 months. Honestly its a great product, it doesn't make miracles but helps very well to recover and build some muscle; and if you take the stack promotion with C4 or Super HD its a great option, worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only issue for me is the taste, so sweet IMO, specially the peanut butter flavor, I don't like it, the only way that I could drink it was with black coffee, it mixed very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general its a great product, 25 gr of protein per scoop; mixes very well; low carb; and very friendly with my stomach.. so if you like the sweet flavors you will love it.. or you will find a way to drink it.. \n",
      "Awesome recovery, nice flavor and good mix. \n",
      "Great protein. I am a sucker for red velvet cake so I had to try it. It is SWEET!! It is good but just a little too sweet for me.\n",
      "Been using Cor whey during my prep and I love it! The Cinnamon swirl is amazing and I would recommend again and again. Cookies n cream is good but I am not reordering it because I am hoping to try another flavor I like better.  There is little cookie pieces in it though which is good! Molton Chocolate is alright... I have had better store bought chocolate protein. However, it is good when mixed into oats or with peanut butter in a shake.  I just didn't like it plain with the aftertaste.  I always use them in a blender and it is always mixed well.  They also cook well into pancakes, mugcakes, and mix into oats.  Just ordered the three new exclusive flavors with the buy 2 get one free so will review after i get those!\n",
      "The Cinnamon Swirl is very very good, love it. Reminds me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal! Just in protein drink form. lol Would reorder again, the Peanut Butter Marshmallow is a good flavor but I wouldn't say the best.\n",
      "Mixing a scoop with 6oz milk/water seemed to be fine for me. I prefer a thicker protein, and it wasn't \"too thick\" at that amount. No grit, mixed really well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Cellucor Mint Chocolate Chip tastes great with milk. It's ok with water, but you are definitely missing out on the full flavor by using water. I always drink protein powders with both to get a real test of the flavor. When I am cutting I use water every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not the biggest mint fan, but this was a really great tasting protein. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of mint and chocolate. \n",

      "I initially tried this protein based on it being a special deal (buy two get one free). I was also looking to change up brands just to get my body off the same old protein. It's ingredients are on par if not better than most other competitors as well as the price point being significantly more affordable especially on sale. The taste of this protein, I've had most of them now, is on par with the best out there at the moment. \n",
      "When I first started lifting I had no clue what to get so I always ended up buying the cheap crap at the local grocery store. But than one day I discovered Cellucor had Whey protein. I bought myself a tub of Cinnamon Swirl and I can honestly say I've never looked at protein the same again! Every single flavor I've tried is utterly amazing, and mixes very well.  I will never buy another brand of protein again!\n",
      "I ordered this because I am always craving Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream.  We all know what the protein in itself can bring to anyones workout.  But taste is what helps me get through taking certain supplements.  This has not disappointed in any areas.  The taste is great with water (which I normally take my protein with) and I can only assume that with the addition of milk it would make for a GREAT shake.  I would recommend this to many to not only get the benefits but to also help with cravings.\n",
      "The best Whey you could get i love the profile and the taste.. i tried cinnamon swirl, peanut butter marshmallow, and chocolate which kinda reminds me of muscle milk if mixed with milk only smoother..love all of them :)..\n",
      "Mixes easily, tastes great.  Very similar to Iso 100 in consistence and taste. \n",
      "This is my first Cellucor product and im a little on the fence about it. I know the profile is right up there with the best but the taste was really lacking for me. I have tried it with water, milk, peanut butter and yogurt and just really cant get it to shine at all. Good product just doesnt taste the greatest. \n",
      "I've been using cellucir whey for months now and must say its some of the best tasting flavors I've tried. The new mint chocolate chip is great especially if your a mint lover can't go wrong. For the other flavors there's nothing new I can say about cnc, pbm, and cs these have been my favorites since I started ordering only cellucor whey \n",

I have never had any problems with any of the Cellucor line in the mixing category and that has not changed with the Mint Chocolate Chip. It is a thin texture so I can pretty well guess it will bake great in the kitchen. I am going to try this tomorrow with some Edy's Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream and see how it goes!\n",

      "Two words. Holy Cow! This is my first try at Cellucor's Whey and it is some kind of amazing. I love it! I was skeptical about the COR-Fetti flavor but it is awesome! It has sprinkles and everything! I mix it with almond coconut milk and add a frozen banana and ice with natural peanut butter in a blender and it comes out like a freaking DQ blizzard or something! The PBM is everything I expected and more especially coming from a PB nut! I was a huge fan of MP Combat Powder but this, to me, is much better! I will try Red Velvet next! I'll keep ya posted.\n",

      "Mixing ability is mediocre-to-good (the colder the water the more clumps you'll get).\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the 3 4lb tubs with a free C4 and I absolutely love the whey protein. I always went with gold standard whey protein and in saw this stack was a good deal so I tried it out. Cinnamon swirl is f***ing delicious. I've never had a protein that tasted this good. I always got peanut butter marshmallow which is also very good. Since these are such good flavors I look forward to having them, so I have use this protein a lot more and I have seen significant results after I have made this switch. I am now a long time buyer of Cellucor's whey protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another great tasting flavor from Cellucor! \n",
      "I got the Cor-fetti flavor and as someone with a sweet tooth, it was WAY too sweet, I end up having to cut it with my ON chocolate to dull down the sweetness. other than that, it does, indeed, taste like cake. The Molten Chocolate is very plain and honestly i wouldn't buy it from cellucor again. the PB Marshmallow is great, as is the new Red Velvet, its not as sweet as the corfetti which is much better.\n",
      "Mixes well, very unique (in a good way) flavor.  Would buy again!\n",
      "This stuff is amazing.  Average price, but great product.  Mixes very well, and the flavor is insane!  Smells AND tastes amazing!  I got 2 tubs, and I hope they still have the Red Velvet when I need to reorder.  I will add that it seems like I enjoy this better when its colder.  I put ice cubes in my blender ball and add water to it.  I don't usually put milk or anything else in it, but it seems like it would be just as good, if not better tasting, with various additions.  Order the Red Velvet - it's worth it!\n",
      "I bought this the other day because of the buy one get one half off sale. Thought I would give a new flavor a try because I was starting to get burnt out from the same old chocolate flavor. Ended up getting COR-fetti cake batter. It mixed great and tasted fantastic. I didn't find it to be too sweet, but just right in the taste. I would definitely buy this again. \n",
      "Pretty decent whey at a good price.  Nothing special, but not protein spiked.\n",

      "Cannot remember what vanilla or chocolate tasted like, has been a while since I had them.\n",
      "As you can see I really enjoy this company and their products. That being said there are positives and negatives to their way. Cinnamon Swirl and the Cake Batter and 10/10 drank both tubs all the way. If you're going to get any of them, those two are it. Cookies N' Cream probably tastes okay, but I wouldn't know since it doesn't dissolve. It says all clumpy and hard no matter what I do. STAY AWAY. PB Marsh is one of those flavors that I got exhausted on very quickly and could no longer take, even the thought of it makes me feel queazy. But some people really like that one. Molten Chocolate tastes just like Chocolate milk, but for me it left an artificial taste in my mouth that made it a turn off. \n",
      "My first time buying this product, and I waited for the buy 2 get 1 free sale of the Cor-Fetti Cake Batter. At first, I tried it in a shake, and was not overly impressed. I felt the flavor tasted like chemicals. My boyfriend then suggested to make protein pancakes with it..And they were amazing!!!!! Since then I have been baking with it, and everything I have made turns out fantastic. I have not had another shake, but I WILL be ordering the Red Velvet to see how that tastes :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I love all of Cellucor's products.  This particular flavor is very strong to drink by itself.  However, makes extremely tasty pancakes and mugcakes. \n",
      "If your from the UK, don't order the Red Velvet Cake Batter flavour unless you would like it to be seized by customs, and put on your record so you can never order any similar products ever again without receiving a hefty fine.\n",

      "Not only that, you still have to pay for the product and get no refund.\n",

      "I am super pleased with cellucor and these flavours!!! I read some reviews on both purchased flavours and after some people complaining about the cor-fetti i was scared to try it. UM WRONG... it was so delicious and I highly recommend it, especially the red velvet flavour!!! i definitely will not need a cheat meal for a long time with these bad boys!!! Protein pancakes all day everyday AND they turned out so be super fluffy and tasty! 100% loving this product. \n",
      "Just received my 4lb's of cinnamon swirl today. As soon as I opened up the container at the gym everyone could smell it and said smelled good. I had it today with milk and its the best tasting protein I've ever had. Im a huge fan of Cellucor and was not disappointed once again. Also, thanks BB.com for the 10% coupon too which made this buy even better. Will defiantly buy more for the future and other products. \n",
      "This is a really good protein powder. I bought it on special buy 1 get 1 half off so the price was a bonus. The peanut butter marshmallow is good, but basically only tastes like peanut butter. The cor-fetti I bought with my fiancÃ© in mind and she really likes it. It mixes well in a shaker cup with 2% milk. I would put this in my top 5 protein powders along with phase-8, syntha6, BPI whey HD and Myofusion. They are all good products, so I just buy whatever is on sale.\n",
      "I have tried many of cellucor's flavors and I keep coming back to the peanut butter marshmallow, its so yummy.  The cookies and cream was not my favorite and neither was the cor fetti cake batter which doesn't taste like cake.  I was really excited to try to red velvet, but so disappointed in the taste!  Is it me, or does the red velvet and cor fetti taste exactly the same?? seems like they used the same recipe but added pink color. I hope to try the Cinnamon swirl soon.\n",
      "I purchased the cinnamon swirl and peanut butter marshmallow flavors on special. They mix easier than other brands I have tried. The flavors are GREAT! (I am mixing with 30 cal almond milk). Neither are gritty or thick and I can drink them immediately after shaking - no waiting for froth to settle. \n",
      "Ordered the 3 servings size sample pack. I am lactose intolerant, so I was a little skeptical that the digestive enzymes were going to be enough. But this stuff doesn't cause me any issues at all. Additionally, the flavor is good. I make it a little weaker than called for (1 scoop, 16 oz of water). The flavor ends up being like watered down hot cocoa. It would be excellent in almond or coconut milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will be purchasing the larger sizes and more flavors of this whey powder,\n",
      "This stuff is great. I currently have the Molten Chocolate,  Strawberry Milkshake, and the Cookies & Cream in the 4th tubs. I think Cookies & Cream tastes ok, but it does have a sweet aftertaste that is not that good. Strawberry Milkshake is amazing. It has great flavor and mixes very well. Molten Chocolate is my favorite so far. Tastes like a chocolate milkshake. I have tried all 3 of these floors with water. They don't taste all that great to be honest with just water. The way I make my protein shakes is with milk, ice cream, and then the protein. With just milk, the chocolate and strawberry taste awesome. The ice cream just makes it better.  Can't comment on the mass and strength gain myself. Only been working out for the past month though. I would recommend these highly. I love drinking my shakes and they don't cost an arm and a leg to make.\n",
      "My personal opinion is that I feel that the flavors could be a bit sweeter, but the taste of the product is A+ the flavors actually taste like what the label says! Great that dose of natural occurring bcaas, and this protein tends to leave me feeling full for longer than most other mixed protein blends. However, Cellucor is more expensive than most other brands so...you are getting what you pay for. So shop during buy 1 get 1 free deals or buy 1 get 1 50% off\n",
      "Excellent protein. I don't have any complaints about this stuff. Every flavor I've tried has been delicious. My favorite is the cor fetti cake batter. I use it in cooking to. Mixes very well. \n",
      "My first impression of cellucor was their peanut butter marshmallow flavor which I wasn't very fond of, but I got sample packs of cinnamon swirl and MAN! it's amazing. I make my protein waffle with this flavor every morning and it never gets old. The red velvet flavor is awesome too! Mixed with almond milk is even better. I love how smooth and creamy cellucor is. I used to stick with Optimum Nutrition but now I'm staying with Cellucor :)\n",
      "Absolutely addicted to the new Red Velvet Cake Batter protein!! Ive tried a few flavors already and they do not disappoint! Def delicious :)\n",
      "I just bought both PB Marshmallow and Cake Batter.....first BB.com shipping is amazing!!!! It came to my door the very next day! :)   I really liked both protein powders.....the Cake Batter (which even looked like fun-fetti cupcake mix) tasted pretty darn good!  I thought it tasted like a sweet vanilla flavor.  I'm excited to bake with this flavor for some sweet clean treats! :)  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now unto the PB Marshmallow.....in a word, AMAZING!!! I highly recommend this flavor!  It seriously is the BEST!!!\n",
      "I like this protein powder.  It mixes well and does not thicken up.  It is also good in recipes.  I was disappointed in the COR-Fetti Cake Batter and returned it.  It did not taste like cake batter at all.\n",
      "NEVER STOP MAKING THE RED VELVET! THIS STUFF IS THE BEST. IF BODYBUILDING.COM STOPS SELLING IT I WILL BE LET DOWN, LOVE IT!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I received this protein a few days ago from bodybuilding.com. I have to say Cellucor nailed this flavor! I have a large variety of protein flavors although ever since I received the red velvet cake it is all I have been using. I drink shakes with it and bake. If you enjoy protein sludge or protein pancakes then this for you. Cooking with this protein powder is enjoyable. It mixes very easily I do not need to shake it up to much. I am addicted to this and will be ordering again later this week so I don't run out!!!\n",
      "This flavor takes like syrup, not like cake batter at all. I like the cinnamon swirl and peanut butter marshmallow though. \n",
      "This is by far my favorite protein powder on the market. Great mixability with almost everything I've tried. The flavors really shine when you bake with them (protein cakes rule). Definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a go to protein powder.\n",
      "I love Cellucor and use a good amount of the products they put out! Cor-Whey is fantastic and tastes great... great protein from a trusted company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Protein.  Really love peanut butter marshmallow.  I was surprised I didn't like cinnamon swirl more given the high rating.  My wife likes it though.  For some reason peanut butter mixes better.  Cinnamon powder seems to stick to my blender bottle in the bottom corners.  Both taste good with milk and vanilla almond milk.  Sometimes do half milk/half water\n",
      "\n",
      "Tried this when I saw the crazy deal on BB.com.  Great chocolate flavor, vanilla is decent, cake batter is weird to me... too sweet. \n",
      "Mixes into a thick creamy shake with minimal shaking.\n",
      "Really impressed with this protein, I've tried a few and this is going to be a regular when it is on sale!\n",
      "This flavor is very, very bland.  You will be disappointed.  Very bland flavor - particularly for the price.  Do not purchase.  \n",
      "Don't have any complaints, strongly recommend trying it\n",
      "i just finished my first shaker of the red velvet (ordered on wednesday when it was released, it was at my door today on friday)...flavor wise, they nailed it, it tastes great, the texture is pretty smooth and just thick enough with 8 ounces of water, it's probably a tad overpriced per serving but stacks up close against ON gold standard in that regard...this being my first experience trying cellucor's protein, it was definitely a positive one and certainly when i'm looking for more variety flavor wise then what i can get going with isolates, i'll look into trying other flavors\n",
      "I love this whey protein! Cellucor usually has awesome flavors and taste but these are just simply amazing. I love the peanut butter marshmallow it's like a desert! The cinnamon swirl is amazing when mixed in with oatmeal. The whipped vanilla tastes just like a vanilla milkshake, it's not too thin and not too thick or creamy; very nice balance of consistency. I have no complaints about the powder itself, it mixes well and does the job it's meant for. Cellucor could include some BCAAs or glutamine to go above and beyond all the other competitors but that's just being not picky. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favorites by far! Smooth mixing and great flavor even when mixed with water. I use it in recipes for waffles/pancakes, crepes and mug cakes as well. The best flavors I've had (so far) are the chocolate and vanilla. I found the cinnamon to be a little too artificially sweet for me, so I just add a little cinnamon to the vanilla now. Cookies and cream is good, but not my favorite. Cake batter is next on the list!\n",
      "Cinnamon swirl hands down is the best, very smooth. Sometimes I add extra ground cinnamon or a dash of maple syrup (even though it needs neither) I make mine blended in a blender with ice. Tastes like a real shake. \n",
      "Cookies and cream pretty has tiny chunks of chocolate in it and very satisfying for a low cal sweet tooth. \n",
      "Great flavor- very smooth with no chalky, fake protein taste at all! Mixes really well with just water in my blender bottle. \n",
      "\n",
      "The cake batter flavor really does take like funfetti cake batter. \n",
      "The cinnamon swirl tastes like the milk you drink after having a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch cereal, just a little bit watered down. \n",
      "Cookies n' cream was a bit disappointing for me, it tastes a bit like every other cookies n' cream protein I've had and has more of a fake protein flavor than the others. Also it has these chunky cookie pieces which don't dissolve in the blender bottle leaving a chunky ending to the shake. They do add good flavor when blended in the blender.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely my new go to protein powder! It has the informed choice logo (no weird ingredients and no banned substances) and most importantly it tastes amazing.\n",
      "Solid ingredient profile, appears to have minimal fillers as is present in some other protein powders.  This is appreciated.  Depending on the flavor, I found variant mixability.  Chocolate and cake batter left clumps and bits at the end via standard shaker cup, but overall mixes well.  Both flavors were good, chocolate was good but I find this to be a safe flavor.  Cake batter was surprisingly good, again mixability did affect flavor.  Peanut Butter mixes perfectly through just a few shakes, and the taste was perfect.  Not overpowering or underwhelming.  Cost appears acceptable for what you are getting, however, I usually only buy this when there is a promotion.\n",
      "Will order again.\n",
      "The protein is great.  Mixes decently well, but sometimes clumps in my shaker which is why i gave it only 9/10.  That might have something to do with my shaker though, so don't let that deter you!  The cookies and cream flavor is great to mix with 1/2 almond milk and 1/2 water.  Tastes like a milkshake!\n",
      "First time tried this Positives all around.\n",
      "Mixability- Great (y) @scoops in almond milk shaker cup, no chunks, Mixed with peanutbutter , oatmeal. No problems mixing with anything. Improved taste with the whey included.\n",

      "This was ok, mixed well, the flavor could have been better but its a protein powder.  It works and mixes well.  \n",
      "I tried the Cinnamon Swirl. I'm freakin' nuts about the flavor. Also I didn't feel super full after having a serving but only had trial version so I can't tell any thing past that. But I'd buy more it. \n",
      "the flavor of this protein is very good. Mixes well with water and I use it to cook as well. I would certainly recommend this to anyone and as always Cellucor's  products have great a taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucor's whey protein has quickly became my all time favorite Protein!  The Cinnamon Swirl is absolutly amazing. Love mixing it with my morning oatmeal. Add a few raisins and you have a little bowl of heaven :)  Mixes great, taste amazing, price is good. Have no compalints on this one or any of their flavors!\n",
      "Best tasting protein i've ever  tasted, but its pricey. \n",
      "Very strong favor but a lot better than the Cake Batter or the Molten Chocolate\n",
      "I have a hectic schedule and dont have time to cook. I dont get enough protein in my diet so i needed a supplement to meet my macros.  This was the perfect choice and fits into my diet perfectly at 130 calories. 25g of protein, low carbs. The nutritional profile, price and overall good reviews convinced me to purchase this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "The molten chocolate IMO is your average chocolate shake. Tastes good but isnt mind blowing. It mixes ok with 8oz water, I'd give it a 7/10, i had to put some effort into it when shaking it in my blender bottle to get rid of all the little chunks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl is interesting. I was a little worried that the tast would be over powering based on the smell when i opened the container. It has a Light flavor, and like others mentioned, it tastes like cinnamon toast crunch cereal milk. Mix, i give it a 10/10. I mixed with 8oz of water and a few shakes it was frothy and chunk free.\n",
      "\n",
      "overall, for the price (BOGO) and nutritional value, i'm satifisied with my purchase.\n",
      "Great taste, mixes well tastes really good with vanilla almond milk unsweetned of course.  :)\n",
      "Favorite whey protein powder brand, awesome mixability, great taste! Peanut butter marshmallow is the best whey protein powder I have ever tasted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bought this product for more of a fast digesting protein used mainly after workouts. Like the product overall but if you are looking for taste i wouls suggest looking elsewhere. The powder mixes well but the cookie chunks are fairly large. Would reccomend for the results but not for the taste.\n",
      "I love this product. Cellucor's whey protein delivers amazing taste, with the exception on the strawberry; it was just okay to me) with miniaml carbs (3 per serving). I think if I had to pick, I would say the PB marshmallow is my first favorite followed by the cinnamon swirl. Noth are absolutely delicious in whatever you use them in. I also purchase Gaspari's Peanut Butter Cookie Dough, but feel that Cellucor's is just that much better. The peanut butter flavor pops out more than Gaspari's (which has 5 g carb per serving).\n",
      "Absolutely recommend this product.\n",
      "Cellucor has done a great job creating this. It's scary how great this product tastes. Not too sweet like MusclePharm and sweeter than ON. The texture is excellent and mixes easily. Low thickening. No fillers. Very low carbs & fat but it certainly doesn't taste that way! Easily my favorite protein powder that I've ever had.  Would not hesitate to buy at full price & definitely stocking up when it goes on sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly, highly recommended.\n",
      "I bought the vanilla, cinnamon swirl and cookies n cream flavours (as well as peanut butter marshmallow from another site). For me personally they are far too sweet. The peanut butter marshmallow tasted exactly like that (although as a drink it's possibly not the best concept after all haha). I will be going back to USN for my comp prep (forcing myself to drink these until April would not make me a happy bunny!). If you have a strong sweet tooth then these are perfect for you. I will be using them post-comp in things like pancakes and waffles as I believe these flavours would taste great in recipes. Perhaps with milk it's nicer but who knows\n",
      "Tried the COR-fetti (tastes like vanilla), and I must admit that it takes real effort for me to drink it. ON protein in Vanilla flavor tastes a million times better.  Just my opinion.\n",
      "Good taste. I love it added in my oatmeal in the A.M.\n",
      "This protein is simply awesome.\n",
      "Has a perfect taste, good amount of proteins and bcaas per scoop.\n",
      "And it's not expensive.\n",
      "If you are still looking for some protein to take or if you want to change to some good whey, give to it a try.\n",
      "overall this line of products are great the cinnamon was just a bit to over powering for my liking I wont bebuying it again but def going to try the others ones\n",
      "The Whipped Vanilla is your typical Vanilla with milk, has that usual over-bearing vanilla-extract taste. However I just recently began mixing this with OJ and it made a world of difference. I've mixed several vanillas with OJ and they weren't all there, this however is very different!\n",
      "This protein is easily digestable (little to no cramping), and it doesn't fill you up to the max even with a stacked mix in a blender (2-3 scoops + 24OZ liquid) so you're still able to fit a meal in with the protein and other macros associated with this.\n",
      "I would give it a 10/10 but I wish it was a bit earier to mix by hand(I just default to my blender anymore), and the vanilla taste was a bit better in milk.\n",
      "This is by far the best tasting whey I have ever had. Cinnamon Swirl is my favourite! \n",
      "The Macros are good for the product, the side-effects on body seem to be minimal.\n",
      "I have it in a smoothie with fruits & sometimes spinach&berries. Cinnamon Swirl is best tasting, on part with top Syntha-6 flavors like Moccacino, Molten chocolate is also good, Peanut butter is slightly above average but not a repeat.\n",
      "This is important, the scoop is quite likely too large when filled to brim but not packed, maybe 15-20% more, so beware you are getting 40-42g, not the  35g on label\n",
      "This was my first experience with any of the Cellucor line. I have to say I am not disappointed. The chinaman flavor was fabulous in the morning with oats mixed in. It mixes well with water with out the chunks that a cheaper product produces. All in all good product, I will definitely be ordering again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a good protein for its price ... Cake batter tastes like old vanilla to me ... The mixability was ok on the first week, then it gets harder and harder.. Lots of clumps.. Won't buy again \n",
      "This is by far the best tasting protein I've had. It's easy to mix in a shaker or if you're wild with it, you can mix it up in a shake. Either way you're going to enjoy the heck out of this protein!\n",
      "This is my favorite whey so far, it is a great price when you get the stack, all of the flavors I've tried so far were very good with the molten chocolate being my favorite. I woul definitely recomend this product and the stack.\n",
      "Honestly just tastes like vanilla, nothing special about it. Don't buy it.. get another flavor. \n",
      "Meh, really was not very good. Edible but disappointing. A good Vanilla would be a better pick. We were pretty disappointed as my 17 year old son loves the cake batter products.\n",
      "I gave this a 5 because the smell reminded me of a cigarette smell in a car.  The taste wasnt bad but I could not get past the smell personally.  I will be ordering another flavor, I like cellucors products.\n",
      "I love all of Cellucor's proteins, because of the taste and nutritional information. (Also loves that its a big serving and not a small scoop, may be weird but it helps haha)\n",
      "\n",
      "However Cor-fetti Cake batter tastes so chemically and gross that I don't think I'll even be finishing my 2 lbs of it. I am not a fan, it just doesn't taste as good as the rest of the other flavors. Cool concept but poor execution on taste. \n",
      "I have tried 12+ brands of protein looking for the right one for me and I think this is it. \n",
      "\n",
      "A big deciding factor when I choose a product is taste. If I feel like I am forcing myself to down a bottle of *** to try and get better results I will start resenting working out and also be less inclined to actually use the product to get better results.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the molten chocolate and it both tasted great and dissolved well. No chalky after taste, no floating particulates, good consistency. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I haven't given a higher rating is because I am still new to this particular product and will wait and see the results from use before scoring more, but as of right now, I am quite happy with it.\n",
      "Besides for the strawberry, Cellucor whey tastes amazing.  I have had all the flavors with Molten Chocolate being my favorite.  The profile is very nice and should fit into everyones macro's (caloric Intake).  Mixes great and has a smooth texture.\n",
      "Very good protein. Lots of flavors, had some good gains on this stuff. Can go wrong with those Isolates. Wish it had more servings but quality/quantity oh well.\n",
      "Stuff works good see good gains. \n",
      "\n",
      "I mix my COR-Performance with water and it still tastes pretty good!\n",
      "I would definitely recommend it to any one who's looking for a solid all around \n",
      "protein supplement.\n",
      "Great protein, I tried Strawberry, Peanut Butter, and Cinnamon. The Peanut Butter was hands down the best, would definitely try again. They all mixed pretty good with either milk or water, with just a slight \"graininess\" to it.\n",
      "I purchased the stack special with the three 2lb whey proteins and unpicked strawberry milkshake, peanut butter marshmallow, and whipped vanilla. I have tried the PBM and the SM and both were good I liked the flavor of the PBM a little better because its tastes less artificial. I love that the shake is a little thick and frothy even with water, it's satisfies me more. I would defiantly recommend these products to anyone. The calories are low as well as the fat and carbs and there is still a sufficient amount of protein I am defiantly a fan!\n",
      "Great product. The price x benefit is not the best, but it has a great protein concentration and great taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't mixes very well..............\n",
      "Great protein powder at a great price.  I like the Molten Chocolate but i found that the Cookies and Cream had little chocolate chips in it that made it inconvenient when using a shaker cup.  I bet it wouldn't be too bad when used in a blender.  I just don't like chunks in my drink. haha\n",
      "Statistically speaking, this protein is one of the best whey protein powders out there. but the flavors just weren't for me. works great as a post workout, but i don't use it anymore after i got ON's gold standard whey. I highly recommend ON's products. but this works just as good if you enjoy the flavors.\n",
      "One of my favorites! You get a lot in just 130 cal and barely any carbs. Tastes great too! \n",
      "My favorite protein overall!!! Great texture for easy blending. Makes great protein pancakes as well! Cinnamon swirl is so good with everything! ! Cannot wait to order the cake batter!  \n",
      "This stuff is honestly pretty good flavor wise and performance wise.\n",
      "cinnamon swirl-It tastes like vanilla with hints of cinnamon, tastes kinda like the milk you drink after eating all the cinnamon toast crunch in your bowl just a little more watered down.\n",
      "\n",
      "molten chocolate- basically tastes like milk chocolate, but better than the other proteins chocolate flavors\n",
      "\n",
      "cake batter-honestly didn't find this to be special at all, but it tastes good. It tastes like cake batter flavor and thats it. \n",
      "\n",
      "While taking this I've notices gains and its not hard to chug down like other proteins. It has no fillers like taurine and what not, THIS IS HIGH QUALITY must try. \n",
      "This product is by far the best protein I have ever tasted I hope Cellucor keeps it around for a very long time!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This flavor is the best whey protein I have ever tasted! Once you open it you can already smell the cake batter aroma. There's even sprinkles or whatever in it to give it that overall feel/taste. Speaking of -- i ordered it Monday night and it was here by Wednesday Afternoon standard shipping! So great! The taste is essentially identical to any cake batter product. I am used to taking Vanilla Almond Designer Whey which I thought was pretty good but this knocks that out of the water. I am 100% satisfied with this product and highly recommend it! The macros are very ideal and it mixes/bakes great. Thanks BodyBuilding/Cellucor!\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl - 10/10 perfect taste, mixability (water/greek yogurt)\n",
      "Whipped Vanilla - 10/10 \n",
      "Cookies'n'Cream - 10/10 Love eating an oreo in a shaker cup or with my yogurt...\n",
      "Corfetti - 10/10 sprinkles? Yup. Cake? Yup. Perfect? Yup.\n",
      "Molten Chocolate- 10/10 literally the thickest shake ive ever had (mixed with water!) it tastes just like a thick creamy glass of chocolate milk\n",
      "Peanut Butter Marshmallow- 10/10 Youre literally drinking a glass of super smooth peanut butter... Its like you made a PB&J, and you take a bite, and the first thing that hits your tongue is some creamy PB... my god amazing...\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason i gave it a 9 was because i didnt love their strawberry flavor, but i havent honestly found a strawberry that i like (i've tried like 3 or 4 brands...). \n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl is the best tasting protein I have tried thus far (I\u0000ve used ON gold and MP Combat). Satisfying flavor and you feel like your muscles are fed. Molten Chocolate was average. I switched for a bit to Combat just to try some new Flavors. I couldn\u0000t wait to finish that tub. Back to Cinnamon swirl and I\u0000m staying! I need to find out how I can get sponsored by Cellucor so I can get this stuff for free!!!\n",
      "Awesome protein overall - great tasting, low carbs, low fat, and very few additives.  I find this to be the perfect protein to use when on a cut since it doesn't\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed all the flavors except the Molten Chocolate - I definitely wouldn't purchase it again or reccomend it to anyone who likes choclate protein.  It is more of a dark choclate that is not sweet at all.  Had a hard time getting through the 4 lb tub I purchased.  All the others I tried were excellent though and I can't wait to try the Confetti Cake.\n",
      "Sooo its been some time on this product, gained about 12 lbs of mean muscleâ¦ Hard 10 on this product as its given great results and improvements in strength (due to my hard work) with product supplementing my routine. Thanks!\n",
      "Strawberry is always my go to flavor for shakes and cellucor hit this one out of the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor is amazing!  10/10 for sure \n",
      "most strawberry proteins taste good, but they taste like strawberry flavoring.  Strawberry Milkshake literally tastes like I blended up real strawberries into my PWO Shake.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Mix is 10/10-  I never see a single clump nor any leftover morsels in my shaker cup.  An almost instant dissolve!   \n",
      "\n",
      "Nutrition profile is win- 25g protein with just 3g carbs and 1,5 fat.  can't go wrong\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also quite versatile- Along with shakes, I also used in a few other recipes.   Most notably- protein strawberry shortcake.    It also can be added to plain greek yogurt for an extra protein boost.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing product, and it definitely is taking the #1 spot for my choice of whey.\n",
      "I love this product. I'm on my seventh tub of the stuff and I don't plan on switching to anything else anytime soon. The taste is amazing as well as the mixability.  I've put on about 10 pounds since starting to take this stuff a couple of months ago. Out of all the supplements I've taken this is by far my favorite.  I'm really looking forward to trying the new flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "mixes well, tastes great...what else can you ask for in a whey? Buy it now!!!\n",
      "Great protein! All the flavors I've tried are good, but cinnamon is best so far. \n",
      "I love Cinnamon Swirl in smaller doses (flavor gets old at more than a 1 scoop shake).  It tasted like Quaker Maple and Brown Sugar instant oatmeal.  The Molten Chocolate is a solid dark chocolate flavor.  I'm more of a milk or white chocolate guy with my sweet tooth so not my favorite chocolate but solid choice if you like dark chocolate.  The Cookies and Cream is pretty good.  The Cor-Fetti tasted like a not as sweet Pronom vanilla cake batter but neither flavor is strong enough to cover the whey taste.  Good sprinkles after-taste tho.  PBM tasted like peanut flavor as opposed to peanut butter.  Tastes good when mixed with peanut butter or PB2 but didn't like it on it's own.  Solid profile/macros.\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl is best tasting product I've ever had.. hands down! Peanut butter Marshmallow smells odd, but the taste is really good. COR-Fetti Cake Batter isn't anything special, still good tasting though. Cellucor hit a grand slam with these flavors!! \n",
      "I bought this protein because I really wanted to make my protein drinking experience enjoyable. This did not exceed my expectations at all.. First off, the cinnamon swirl scooper was MISSING.. There's a lot of hype about the taste. I didn't find the peanut butter marshmallow sweet at all like other reviewers stated. Maybe if I add milk? But I don't drink milk with my protein. I must say that it does taste better then maybe 70% of the protein powders I've tried but the taste is really over hyped. Taste was pretty light for both, peanut butter marshmallow and cinnamon swirl.   I really wanted it to be sweet. However, I did enjoy the cinnamon a bit more than the peanut butter. \n",
      "If you love Fun-fetti cake like I do prepare to have very happy taste buds.\n",
      "This is one of the best tasting proteins I have ever had. \n",
      "Another product done right by cellucor, the cinnamon swirl is simply the best. Not only does this protein compete with the best in terms of content, it surpasses competition with taste.\n",
      "Not to mention this protein is great for different protein cookie recipes..\n",
      "My favorite new protein! It works very very well for recovery and with meals. By far the best tasting protein I've ever had. Cinnamon Swirl taste is unreal! Great mixed with cottage cheese, yogurt, oatmeal, etc. \n",
      "This is an overall great product. The only flavor I've had was the Cinnamon Swirl. This is the best tasting protein on the market. What I find tastes the best is Almond milk mixed with this protein. I will say the water mix tastes gross. What I did was get my other products unflavored that way I can just mix everything with the protein post workout. I found this to be the best idea and work the best for me. Get your creatine and glutamine both unflovored throw it in with your protein mix with almond milk or regular milk and you will taste the greatness promise you you will love the taste.\n",
      "This protein powder work, mix good and super flavor.\n",
      "I just bought a tub of strawberry milkshake protein from cellucor and I figured id share my thoughts on it...\n",
      "\n",
      "MIX-ABILITY- 9  i mixed it in my blender bottle with both milk and water and the powder mixed as good as a protein powder can mix with each.\n",
      "\n",
      "EFFECTIVENESS- 10 with 25g of protein per scoop this is possibly the most effective protein ive used. only 130 cals per scoop and I get all the protein I need post workout. needless to say ive been making gains and It helps a lot with soreness also.\n",
      "\n",
      "TASTE- 10 I didn't really know what to expect with the taste but I was pleasantly surprised.  Most strawberry proteins taste like crap in my opinion, but I feel this one is the best on the market hands down, it actually tasted like a strawberry milkshake.  \n",
      "\n",
      "PRICE- 9 its priced pretty competitively at 27$ for a 2 lb tup as compared to muscle milk at about 24$ where as cellucor has about 9g more protein and less cals and sugars etc per scoop I say its a great buy. \n",
      "\n",
      "OVERALL- 9 overall a great product to add to your arsenal, it has great flavor to go along with a solid ingredient profile at a legitimate price, I suggest you give it a try. \n",
      "I've been using Product for a little while now and I think it is an awesome Protein. I love the flavors and it mixes pretty well. I've always thought Cellucor to be a great company and I'd recommend this protein to anyone who is looking for a great protein for a great price. I like that Cellucor is a company that responds back to customer complaints or positive feed back right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Thanks Cellucor\n",
      "Cellucor always has amazing taste, and their products have been effective every time I used them. I will be buying this product again and for the foreseeable future.  \n",
      "Great Whey protein product. Fills you up. This is the only protein I use now during pure muscle building weeks. Low calories, low calories from fat, low sugar, high protein, great taste. The best part is the great price...\n",
      "Great protein, really taste!\n",
      "Molten chocolate and whipped vanilla taste very good, but this protein made me have digestion problems, every time a drink 1 scoop of this i have to run to the bathroom after 10minutes or at least get bad intestinal movement. Of course thats me.\n",
      "I wanted to change up my protein and got this when they had the special 3 for 70. So far I have only had the molten chocolate and it mixes well and tastes great. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the cellucor brand.\n",
      "I didnt like the flavor, its too strong. its good if you wanna change your protein flavor, but for the long run no. also, made me have digestion problems.\n",
      "This protein works well for me... But really just wanted to write a review on the strange \"Cinnamon Swirl\" flavor.  Where by itself, it's WAAAAY to sweet for me and I would score it a 7... However, with a *banana* added in, it's an 11! It's COMPLETE different experience. The banana somehow balances out the extremely sweet flavor and what you get is a heavenly taste... \n",
      "\n",
      "So on one hand, if you drink this by itself, it's like a 7... Add in a banana, and it's the best protein shake I've ever had... \n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, taste is subjective.  So, as a point of reference, I am comparing Cellucor COR-Performance Whey Strawberry Milkshake flavor to BSN Syntha-6's Strawberry flavor shake.  In my opinion, Syntha-6 Strawberry is the best tasting protein shake I've tasted.  I haven't tasted every single Strawberry-flavored shake, but over the course of 15 years of consuming supplements, Syntha-6 is the best tasting one that I've had.  I had the Cellucor COR Whey shake this morning and did not enjoy the taste of their Strawberry flavor.  It was actually quite tough to put down.  I finished it, so it wouldn't be right to just give it 1 star.  It's decent enough to finish, but compared to Syntha-6 Strawberry, which I give a 10, it's not even close.  \n",
      "Great protein(mixed all with water), my favorite was molten chocolate(had 2 lbs of cinamon swirl, molten chocolate, and peanut butter marshmallow). Didn't like the peanut butter marshmallow, not horrible, but also not amazing. Cinnamon swirl was unique, it was REALLY good for COOKING such as pancakes/oatmeal. Molten Chocolate tasted amazing, probably the best protein i have ever tasted... Only problem was that it didn't mix too well. Protein was effective!\n",
      "Just received my 2lb tub of Cor-Fetti Cake Batter and I'm more than impressed with the flavoring. Tried it in water alone just now and it is delicious. I'll have to mix it in with pancake/waffle batter next! Can't go wrong with Cor-Whey especially since it's not spiked with free form aminos. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't drink this mixed with water, but almond milk (or regular) works great. It's delicious as a smoothie with frozen strawberries and a couple chunks of frozen banana (banana helps bring out the peanut butter flavour). I will be buying this one again.\n",
      "All flavours are too sweet and taste of chemicals. Unless mixed in a smoothie or used for baking, it's just too strong. Tasty, but artificial and leave a slightly bitter aftertaste.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "tastes great but makes me feel bloated terribly\n",
      "One of the best tasting proteins I have ever tried. I have tried 3 flavors and they are all amazing. Digests well, tastes great and mixes well. \n",
      "Very solid protein powder. Great taste and great ingredient profile. Would buy again.\n",
      "This is some delicious protein. Cinnamon swirl is insane and I can't get enough of it. I was real surprised with the strawberry milkshake. I normally don't like strawberry proteins but Cellucor did a great job with theirs. The vanilla is also one of the best vanillas I've had. Tastes like I'm drinking whipped cream. CnC was good, just not a fan of the cookie pieces in there. As far as mixability, it is pretty much mixed with 3 shakes in a shaker cup. No lumps or anything. I will say that when mixed with water the shakes are a little thin, even when I used 4-6 oz of water. All around a great protein though. It might not be the cheapest but I felt like I was getting my moneys worth with how quality this stuff is and the fact that it tastes awesome. \n",
      "This is the best tasting pp\n",
      "The protein itself seems pretty good. The flavoring is ok, definitly not the best tasting I have ever had. The cinnimon swirl is more of a maple syrup taste and the cookies and cream lives up to its name. The smell is also a little off putting but for the deal its a buy for me. I would much rather take trutein cinnabun which is absolutely amazing in every aspect but i dont have that money. The 3 4lb tubs with 30serv. c4 is a really good deal so if u have the money i would go for something like trutein or gold standard but if u don't have a lot of money and want something that will get the job done and doesn't taste too terrible, go with this!\n",
      "I purchased a Cellucor bundle because I had yet to try a Cellucor protein since Super Sport. I was not disappointed with my purchase. Like always the products tasted awesome (especially when I mixed the molten chocolate with the peanut butter marshmallow). The ingredient profile is solid, but is a little on the expensive side if you are taking more than one scoop a day. Other than that, I am really satisfied with the product.\n",
      "Strawberry and Cookies N Cream both taste pretty good.  I'm not a huge Strawberry fan, but I like it as a change of flavor a couple times per week.  Both of those flavors mixed up perfectly and with minimal shaking in my Blender Bottle.  I mixed with 8 oz. of Almond milk and got a consistency that is a little thicker than an ON Gold Standard.  What I found weird about this product was that the Molten Chocolate flavor did not mix nearly as well as the other 2 flavors did.  I would have to mix it up before my workout, let it sit during the workout, and shake it again before drinking it.  The Molten Chocolate flavor is on par with other Chocolate offerings, not as good as Syntha 6 or ON Gold Standard but still good.  I've been using it for 6-8 weeks now and have seen pretty solid gains with it so far, nothing extraordinary but about what you would expect from a protein with its ingredient profile.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I thought it was a very good product and Cellucor is supposed to have a Confetti Cake Batter flavor coming out soon, so I will be getting a tub of that to try out before deciding to stick with ON Gold or go to this as my normal protein.\n",
      "Great product !! I've tried almost all the flavors and wasn't disappointed with any of them but i must say cinnamon swirl is my favorite i've been using this product for a little over a year with cellucors c4 Extreme and I think this whey protein is by far one of the best tasting  proteins out there .... You can't go wrong with cellucor \n",
      "Great flavors good for post workout recovery. Really refuels me after a workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breaking down the Nutritional facts panel I see I am getting 25 grams of high quality protein per scoop. This is a Whey Protein matrix of whey protein isolate, and whey protein concentrate. I personally like that they have put Isolate first on the ingredients panel because the consumer then knows the ratio of isolate is higher than the concentrate, with isolate being a more high quality and easily digested source. Total carbohydrates are listed at 4 grams with 1 gram of sugar, and also 1.5 grams of total fat. This comes to 130 calories per serving which is very nice to fit into anyone\u0000s diet whether cutting or bulking. All the flavors are top notch and the protein mixes great in water or milk. \n",
      "Loveeee the peanut butter marshmellow flavor! It's probably the best protein powder flavor I've ever had! As for the vanilla, well, it's vanilla. It's okay on it's own. I mostly use the vanilla flavor to bake protein goodies with and use both flavors for my protein pancakes! :)\n",
      "When looking for a protein, the goal is to find something CLEAN, TASTEFUL, & GREAT MACRO PROFILE. Cellucor's COR-Performance Whey fits just that. This is one of the cleanest profiles when it comes to whey, no fillers, Cellecor's TruFact label discloses everything in the ingredient profile. You can also assume this from the smooth consistency of the protein powder. When it comes to taste, Cinnamon Swirl & PBM are my favorite. Cinnamon swirl tastes like cinnamon toast crunch & I've turned heads in the gym from the smell of this specific flavor. PBM has a great PB taste without being overpowering when combined w/ the marshmallow aspect. Cookies N Cream is best with milk, but still a great CNC flavor in water. Fits well into a lean macro count.\n",
      "I bought the cinnamon swirl just to mix with my oatmeal in the morning for breakfast and its fantastic! mixes great and helps me start off my morning!  After my workouts I'll get the molten chocolate in my blender bottle, Its the best tasting whey I've had!\n",
      "These are the only two flavors that I've tried so far, and I absolutely LOVE them! I gave the Cinnamon Swirl a 9/10 only because its a little too sweet for my taste when mixed with plain water. I would highly recommend using it for cooking though. It makes the most delicious protein waffles and pancakes!! As far as the Cookies N' Cream goes, that stuff is delicious any way you eat it/ drink it. haha. I just ordered the 2lb stack a couple days ago and should be receiving the Molten Chocolate, Peanut Butter Marshmallow, and MORE Cinnamon Swirl <3 I eat a protein waffle every morning for breakfast so I know its going to go QUICK (: again, I HIGHLY recommend this product to EVERYONE!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor is good but it's entirely too sweet to me.  I'm glad I only purchased the individual servings because it would have been a waste of money if I bought the tub.  But don't get me wrong, the flavor and smell is unreal but I just can't have sweet protein shakes because I get tired of it too quickly.  I'll stick to the usual flavors like vanilla, chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, etc.\n",
      "Actually I bought it becuz of the price of the stack .. but it was good product and the taste was more sweet !!\n",
      "The peanut butter marshmallow tastes great but the protein is very thick, and I found it sticking to the sides and the lid of my shaker cup a lot. Otherwise its a great product.\n",
      "These taste great and even better to cook with .. You will be super pumped that you bought any one of these.. \n",
      "No matter how I tried I could not get this stuff to mix well... It's clumpy and think like mud ... Not a good choice for protein... The only good thing is the taste but like I said it doesn't justify because it doesn't mix \n",
      "The best tasting protein you will ever have. It doesn't even taste like protein.unbelievable taste and mixes with no clumps. The cinnamon swirl tastes like your drinking a ffresh bake cinnamon bun right out the oven. Enjoy drinking it anytime and every time. Have gone through 8 tubs of it so far and can see results. Always get it when theres a promotion for it. \n",

      "This is hands-down the greatest tasting protein powder ive ever had.. and ive tried many brands and flavours of protein before. Absolutely love cinnamon swirl\n",
      "Taste was good. But I saw no results using this product. I actually lost gains at week 3 of using this whey.  Should've just spent the extra ten and stuck with musclepharm.\n",
      "Awesome protein. Profile, mixability, taste, everything is great. In my opinion, this protein is better than the Gold Standard 100% Whey. I does not give me any digestive issues. Recommended!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using various Cellucor products over the last 2 years, and they have never let me down with the quality of their products. Their new COR-Performance Whey Isolate is no different. I have never relied on protein powders as my main source of protein, but the fast acting whey is great post-workout if I know that i won't be able to meet my protein intake for the day. I had the privilege of trying both the Cinnamon Swirl and the Peanut Butter Marshmallow. Both flavors were amazing and mixed very well! I will note that even though I've never had a flavored protein that tasted better when mixed with water than when mixed with milk, but these two flavors both tasted worlds better when mixed with water. I look forward to giving the other flavors a try! **UPDATE**: I am typically not a fan of anything strawberry-flavored, but Cellucor shipped me a 2lb tub of their Strawberry COR-Whey to try. I must say that I was very surprised by the flavor. It's a very subtle strawberry taste, and nothing too overpowering. As with every other flavor of their protein, it mixes excellently in water but seemed just a bit too thick for my likings when mixed with milk. I'd definitely buy this protein but would probably end up using it for making protein pancakes and muffins instead of using it strictly for shakes. \n",
      "By far the best tasting protein I have tasted. Deff will buy this product again. Thank you cellucor\n",
      "Good protien, AVOID THE PEANUT BUTTER MARSHMELLOW, taste like ****\n",
      "DO NOT GET STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE!  It is the worst tasting protein I have ever had.  I literally have to hold my nose in order to drink that flavor and cannot workout with the after taste in my mouth.\n",
      "The most perfect protein EVER! I mean, aside from eggs and whatnot, lol. I'm so excited about the Cor Performance line from Cellucor. The Molten Chocolate tastes just like chocolate milk if you add the actual milk to it, but I know a lot of people like to add water to their protein. And the Cinnamon Swirl....oh, good God. :) A friend of mine talked up the flavor so much I ended up buying it and loved it the minute it hit my lips. It's like drinking the milk out of a bowl that had Cinnamon Toast Crunch in it. SO GOOD. As far as the Whipped Vanilla goes, it was just so basic. I'm not a vanilla fan in the first place and when I got it, I ended up mixing PB2 with it to make a peanut butter shake. I didn't know they had a Peanut Butter Marshmallow flavor. I ordered it and got it in the mail today, and am SO IMPRESSED with the taste. Cellucor has the best tasting protein HANDS DOWN.  I'm pretty stoked about the gains. 25g of protein per serving, and it mixes perfectly in a Blender Bottle, even without the blender ball in it. I'm a true fan of this protein. It helps me recover, doesn't make my stomach upset like a lot of other proteins since it has digestive enzymes in it, and is low carb/low fat making it easy beyond belief to fit into my macros. LOVE IT!!\n",
      "This protein was Ok. It mixes well no clumps at all. Taste left much to be desired. It wasn't awful. I got this during a sale so i DO think it was worth what i paid. But for taste there is definitely better out there.\n",

      "Great taste! I love the chunks of cookie in there. Mixes easily and is a good price!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This product seemed to be getting negative reviews so i decided to come and give my input. The product tastes delicious (strawberry, and the cookie flavor) but the only gripe i have is that there are little chocolate pieces in the cookies and cream flavor .The mix-ability is even good, had a shake this morning and it was ready within 5 seconds. Price is a little on the higher side but not so high you can complain, you get what you pay for in this product. Digestion wasn't upset while taking this protein as others tend to do. Honestly if you want a whey protein there is no reason not to get this. \n",

      "What is it? It was very surprized that this protein is sach a bed thing. Its like cheap indastrial protein mixed this Nesquick! It almost insoluble powder and it should be used only with milk, there are strang small grannuls in cookiesncream flavour that is disgasting on taste! Im very disapointed(\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl surprisingly not very sweet, and Peanut Butter Marshmallow tastes just like peanut butter. Mixes well, and Molten Chocolate is definitely the worst chocolate protein I've ever had. Would not recommend. Doesn't taste like chocolate at all. Difficult to say my results, as I combine this with other proteins and supplements that I have added at the same time, but have been working well as of recently, so I cannot complain.\n",
      "I got the 3 tubs of protein with the C4. great deal on special. Molten chocolate doesn't mix well and has clumps. tried shaker bottles, blenders, spoons whatever. Not happy with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cookies N' Cream has a chemical taste. Especially the cookie parts. Really confused because all the ratings are pretty high but this is the most disgusting protein i've had. stuck with 6 lbs of it now...\n",
      "Best tasting protein I have ever had. I am not a huge fan of chocolate flavored anything but this literally tastes like chocolate milk without the protein after taste. 25g of protein per scoop that you can just sit and drink casually no need to chug it down if you don't want to. \n",
      "Get this if you really love Peanut Butter! you get a lil taste of Marshmallow in it but its just some normal high quality protein i got two 2lb bottles for 30$ so that was a major steal \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best. A little overpriced. \n",
      "i normally but chocolate only, but the 3x2 stack with c4 couldnt pass up that deal. adventured out of my comfort zone and was surprised this is the real deal. might switch from ON protein to to Cellucor.\n",
      "I'm a die hard optimum fan but I couldn't pass up on the 3x2lb with C4 stack. I have since bought another 12 pounds. This stuff is great! Tastes great, mixes great, and has a great ingredient profile for a good clean shot of protein. I love it. and WILL buy it again! P.s. the cinnamon swirl is delicious! \n",
      "I've been using this product for a month now. Results are fantastic and quick! The only thing I don't like is the Cookies N' Cream flavor. I'll get a different flavor! But the product itself really is amazing.\n",
      "The worst tasting protein I have ever bought.  As far as performance goes, it's protein, and I used it to ensure I hit my daily target.  \n",
      "Ive been taking this protein powder for 1 month and have used 2lbs of strawberry/cookies n cream. I take it post work out and have seen good gains in this past month i diet correctly and have a good work out regiment and this product has helped me quell some of my cravings for sweets and also become a routine part of my diet i may end up returning to it after more experimenting, mixing was good cookies n cream was annoying as all of the bits of \"cookie\" sank to the bottom imo get rid of them\n",
      "Got this on BOGO and was skeptic at first but what a  great protein! PURE GAINZZZ FOR DAYZZZ! Cinnamon Swirl is the bomb.com. You can mix it with pancakes and mmmmm...you're gonna want moar!!! Whipped vanilla is ehh I like it with some peanut butter. Chocolate though was not to expectation. Really recommend this protein though. Very good!\n",
      "Just got the peanut butter marshmallow flavor delivered today! Mixed one scoop with 12 oz of low fat milk for my post workout and the taste is absolutely amazing! Like a liquid butterfinger. I'm definitely excited to see what gains I can get from this product.\n",

      "Flavor is Cinnamon Swirl and its an 11/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Best whey I've ever had. Taste great, mixes great, great gains with this product. All and all I highly recommend it. \n",
      "I purchased the bundle with 3- 2lb whey protein powders. I choose the Molten Chocolate, Cinnamon Swirl and PB Marshmallow. The cinnamon swirl was by far my favorite and I used it in everything such from cinnamon apple protein pancakes to pumpkin spice protein bars. I even added it to my oatmeal and it made it taste dessert like. The PB marshmallow is pretty good. I wish it was just peanut butter flavor though. The molten chocolate was disgusting and I would never buy it again! Optimum makes MUCH better chocolate whey. My overall good review is based more on the quality of the product and the great bundle deal I got and also how great the cinnamon swirl is. I just came on to reorder the cinnamon swirl and was so sad and shocked to see that it was discontinued.  I had to reorder from Vitacost. I'm not sure if it was just discontinued on Bodybuilding.com or if Cellucor discontinued it but if Bodybuilding.com discontinued it they made a big mistake since it's the best flavor and had the highest rating and reviews. \n",
      "I ordered 3 of the Cinammon Swirl, after reading all the hype about how good it tastes... and boy I was not let down at all. This is the best tasting protein I've ever had in my life. It honestly tastes like it could be a dessert milkshake. The taste isn't the only benefit, it also digests really well and mixes with ease in a blender bottle. Overall, this is my now go to protein supp (I used to use ON Whey and GNC Wheybolic). Weird how it's not showing up anymore on the store! \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered Cinnamon Swirl and Peanut Butter Marshmallow.  These are both the best tasting protein flavors I've ever had.  The Cinnamon edges out the PBM by a small margin.  I'm used to ON Gold and Cellucore is thicker, mixes as good or better and tastes so much better.  It's worth the few more dollars to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mix oatmeal (finely ground in a coffee bean grinder) with my shakes sometimes and it mixes so much better with the cellucore than the ON.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellucore seems to digest very well with no bloated feeling and, not to be too crass, a lot less gas then I was having with ON.  This isn't a problem either way because I work with a bunch of guys and lets face it, clearing out a room is fun.  Not so much when I'm with the wife though.\n",
      "Best protein out there !\n",
      "It says that you may mix it in with any beverage,  and almost anything but water makes it too thick\n",
      "I bought this a couple weeks ago because it was on a special buy one get one free. Got a molten chocolate because chocolate is always a safe bet when it come to taste and a Cookie N' Cream. The Cookie N' Cream, taste wise wasn't all that and didn't mix well. Beside's that, it a good Whey supplement.\n",
      "I purchased both cinnamon swirl and molten chocolate. Molten chocolate was definitely the safest bet, but I got cinnamon swirl because of the taste feedback from other people on bodybuilding.com. However, Cinnamon swirl is not that good. definitely a vote up for molten chocolate\n",
      "I have been using Muscletech's Phase8 chocolate protein powder for awhile now and recently switched the Cellucor's protein.  The cinnamon swirl is one of the best things I have ever tasted before, not just in protein powders.  Goes down smooth and has a nice texture to it, LOVE IT!  Gonna make all kinds of gains with this....ALL KINDS! \n",
      "Literally the best tasting whey I have every had compared to the big name brands such as musclepharm and BSN Dynatize ON Cellucore stands alone with this product! In my own opinion that is mixes well and even smells great the only downside is the scooper is big and if you have a small blender u will need a funnel \n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl is great! I've mixed it with chocolate milk and put it in smoothies...definitely a great way to get my protein.\n",
      "I absolutely love this protein powder!! It's  my all time fave and I have turned everyone from clients to family members on to this! I love the cinnamon swirl and I've just placed another order for the peanut butter marshmallow flavor! I can't wait to try it. I highly recommend this for fullness, pre workout, post workout, or as a meal replacement. I also like it because if helps me keep my ratios in check and my calories up.  \n",
      "Hate this stuff. Way too strong for me. I'll take BSN's Syntha-6 over this ANY day.\n",

      "Cracked open the tub and right away could smell the peanut butter with no hint of chemicals. Mixes good in water, in almond milk it's more thick but that's ok. Taste is fricken awesome and an awesome after taste. Trying the cinnamon next \n",
      "An excellent low carb/calorie concentrate. The cinnamon flavor is unique, and the PB marshmellow smells delicious. A little better than some other \"gold standards\" of whey, but a little higher priced per serving. Also, high in calcium and plenty of amino acids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl tastes great... not too sweet, making it a flavor that one can continue to have day in and day out. The ingredient profile speaks for itself so no use rating it as a protein. Mixes fairly well but a thick whey protein powder means lower percentage of the powder is actual protein... but can't hold it against them because the taste is worth the fill. I can put this in the same sentence with ON 100% GS Whey. Hope to try Peanut Butter Marshmallow one of these days.\n",
      "I normally use Dymatize ISO.100 which gave me brilliant results but BB dot com had a B1G1 Free offer so i decided to give it a go.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time there had been a hype about the cinnamon swirl flavour but honestly, i found it to be very average, maybe because dymatize set a really high bar already with it's taste ( i use gourmet vanilla).\n",

      "Plus, it's a Matrix and they havent disclosed the percentage or ratio of Isolates/Concentrates so it really doesn't tell what's going in.\n",

Definitely keep an eye out because occasionally bodybuiding.com will put this product on BOGO which is definitely a steal. I also have two tubs of cinn. swirl which I'm looking forward to trying as well as I've heard great things about it. This product tastes great and mixes very well with no clumping whatsoever. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "This being my first Protein shake and reading the reviews I bought this on a buy 2 get one free. This mixes really well, but the flavor of peanut butter that people are raving about set my expectations too high. This has a slight taste of peanut butter, but tastes just fine the way it is. I did get the molten chocolate but havn't opened it yet. No bad after taste and no grittiness when drinking it. no clumping and all of the powder dissolves quickly. So far no bad stomach/gas troubles with it. \n",
      "This is a great protein powder it tastes great and smells awesome. I look forward to working out so I can drink it. This competes with ON gold standard for sure. It blends well without any clumps. I recommend this to anyone looking to switch up proteins because you are bored with the one you are taking. Cellucor makes great products and this one is a great example of that.\n",
      "I luv this protein all kinds of gains............................\n",
      "Bought a stack of the 2 lb protein bottles, and I love it. Molten Chocolate, Whipped Vanilla, and Cinnamon Swirl (my favorite), tastes great, and the powder mixes easy and goes down easy. That being said, even though I love the protein, the Peanut Butter Marshmallow was absolutely horrendous. I don't think I'll be able to finish the batch. \n",

I've taken 5-6 different whey protein from ON to Syntha and others and none gave me gas like this one.  I don't know what it is about this one that's causing it but wife's not happy at all, this one likely going in the trash.  Sorry.\n",

The flavour is great, exactly what one would expect from cookies and cream. However, I am not a huge fan of having bits/pieces of stuff in my whey shakes (pieces of cookie), but I knew that when I was ordering the flavour. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a high quality, great tasting protein!\n",

      "Flavors are amazing ,solid ingredients ,good price will continue to order .\n",
      "I gave this protein a shot and it's really nothing special to me. There was a craze about Peanut Butter Marshmallow and let me tell you... Don't be fooled, the taste is ehhh. You can barely taste the peanut butter and you get a light vanilla chalky taste for the marshmallow. The taste is so faint that I would not buy this flavor again. \n",
      "\n",
      "I plan on using it the protein for baking now because the taste is so faint. I would stick to getting chocolate and adding my own natural PB or almond butter.\n",

I blend a scoop of this with 2 tbsp natural PB, half a cup of ice, and a cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk and it tastes like a reese's milkshake. It's SO stinking good.\n",

      "Just like everybody else says it tastes like cinnamon toast crunch, absolutely delcious very satisfying, got the limited promotion, buy one get one free! CELLUCOR strikes again, great line of supplements!\n",
      "This protein powder is high quality made of mostly whey protein isolate, and it also has digestive enzymes and over 5 grams of bcaas.  I really like the cookies and cream taste, along with the chocolate, I prefer to mix them to get a chocolate cookies and cream.  It mixes perfectly with water and milk.  As with most Cellucor products it is costly but the quality is worth the price.  I cant wait to try cooking some of this protein since it tastes great! I highly recommend this protein powder to anybody that wants a top notch quality protein powder.\n",
      "Honestly upon first purchasing the cinnamon swirl flavor I was only able to find very few reviews on it...so I was unsure of what to expect when the package arrived. Upon opening the lid, the room instantly filled with the flavor of cinnamon (imagine almost a bakery/cinnamon rolls aroma). From that instant I knew I would love this flavor. My nose did not deceive me...this flavor is by FAR one of the BEST I have tried PERIOD. It mixes well, it tastes phenomenal just as a shake or turned into a smoothie. I use it to bake and create pancakes and I cannot get enough :) Highly recommend this product! I am already buying more as I type this.\n",
      "* I liked all three but my least favorite one was the strawberry milkshake. It is just not my preference to take after a workout, however, it is good for morning vegetables shakes for that extra flavor. \n",

      "Let me just start out by mentioning that this product exceeded my expectations. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking for a Whey protein that was similar to the other brand I would take (Optimum Nutrition) \n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed that Corn Syrup was being used in Optimum Nutritions Whey protein and I basically tried all of the flavors of their protein. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the flavor Cinnamon Swirl and when it finally arrived at my house, I opened the cap and took a whiff; and let me tell you it was one of the best smell from a protein I have ever experienced. Even my dad (who hates the smell of protein) loved the smell. The taste was out of this world with Non-fat Milk. I take it right after a workout and as a meal replacement and keeps me satasfied throughout the day.\n",
      "I love this brand! All the flavors make amazing sludge as well as shakes. The PBM is my favorite protein ever, and the whipped vanilla is outstanding. The chocolate tastes just like a pudding pack you had in your school lunch! My only complaint is that the CNC has a noticable synthetic flavor, but it still tastes good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great macro ratios, quality protein and they constantly have great deals and stacks available. You really can't go wrong with this for your protein needs!\n",
      "delicious! actually tastes like peanut butter, I don't really taste marshmallow but i don't care ! I really enjoy the pb flavor I even added a spoon full of unsweetened cocoa, yum. if you like pb you will like this. dissolves well made a nice thick shake in my bullet with 3 ice cubes \n",
      "I'm still working on my first tub of molten chocolate... so far, I LOVE it!  It tastes amazing!  I'm really focusing on making small changes to improve my overall health, and one of those things was to quit stopping at Starbucks and getting a calorie-ridden coffee drink every morning and then not eating a proper breakfast.  I started blending 1 scoop of the molten chocolate, almond milk, ice, and about 4 ounces of iced coffee concentrate (they sell it in a bottle at Trader Joe's) all together.  It is seriously amazing!  It tasts as good as any mocha frappuccino, but it's so much healthier, not to mention cheaper!  Bodybuilding.com has by far the best deal on this stuff, I can't wait to try some of the other flavors!  I have been using a personal blender whenever I use this powder.  I tried just mixing with water one day, but it was a little chunky.  No big deal for me.  \n",
      "All three flavours I tried taste amazing and mix well. I usually put a scoop of the Peanut Butter Marshmallow or the Cinnamon Swirl in my oatmeal in the morning and its sooo good! The molten chocolate is probably my favourite flavour of the three.. already finished my tub! Will buy again and highly recommend\n",
      "As far as protein goes, this one pretty much takes the cake. I typically mix with water, but it mixes so easily that I can stir it into a glass of water without any clumps whatsoever. Another thing I enjoy, since I frequently mix with water, is that it does thicken up really well, unlike some proteins I've tried in the past. This helps to make it seem like there's more than just liquid in my stomach, which may not be a positive for everyone, but it is for me. Delivers a hefty 25 grams of protein per 130 cal scoop, without a ridiculously long list of who-knows-what kind of ingredients. Flavors are wonderful, and I love that they aren't ridiculously sweet. Exceptionally pleased with this protein and will continue to use it in the future.\n",
      "I have tried a ton of chocolate proteins and they all seem to have a similar flavor, with some having a little more sweetness, but not COR-Performance Whey. This chocolate flavor is so unique and really a refreshing change from all the other chocolate proteins I have tried. I've been blending this with water and a few ice cubes and every shake has been perfect. I also usually put a scoop of whey in my oatmeal in the morning and every whey has either been too dry or too soupy, but this whey gets the right consistency every time. I highly recommend this flavor particularly if you are into chocolate proteins.\n",
      "One of the best tasting protein powders on the market.  I mix this in with my oatmeal almost every morning.  I also like to put a half scoop mixed with any other chocolate flavor for my post workout shake.  Great flavor and mix ability.\n",
      "The product mixes well and has solid numbers, but the strawberry has a very synthetic flavor. You can taste and smell the chemicals in it. Compared to the taste of syntha 6, a strawberry milkshake flavor teenagers have told me they'd order in a restaurant, this fails. Big time.\n",
      "I found a recipe that required the peanut butter marshmallow flavor, and since there was a buy 2 get 1 free sale I figured I better read the reviews before buying that much of one flavor. It is amazing!!! mixed with water it is good, but mixing with almond milk in my shaker cup it gets really smooth and fluffy to drink, it is the most amazing flavors of protein I have ever drank in a shaker. I usually have to mix mine in a blender with other stuff for it to taste good. Cinnamon swirl tastes just like a cinnamon bun, great for protein cookies :) Can't wait to try more flavors.\n",
      "Tasty and mixes well.\n",
      "Love this flavor. I mix it in my oats every morning. \n",
      "LOVE the flavors! Gives me options to make my evening \"desserts\" (a.k.a. protein pancakes or milkshakes)\n",
      "This Ishtar best protein I have ever tried! I absolutely love how well the powder mixes with water! It is definitely a smooth protein that will satisfy anyone's sweet tooth! I have tried other protein blends over the years, but I found this one to be the best! Cellucor has so many great deals, and buying this protein is a great investment! You will not be disappointed! :)\n",
      "best tasting whey protein molten chocolate is yummy . as have just started with this brand will keep you guys posted about the results as well\n",
      "Cinnamon Swirl: Tastes like the milk after you eat some cinnamon toast crunch. Awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "PBM: Tastes like the milk after you eat some reeses puffs. Once again, awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whipped Vanilla: Tastes just like the flavor says. Can drink this every day, but there are other vanillas out there (Trutein comes to mind) that are more delectable.\n",

      "You know you're getting a good protein as COR-Performance has been tested and found to meet label claims. Solid and reliable protein powder.\n",
      "Cellucor protein is one of the most delicious whey proteins out there!  I do not have to pinch my nose while drinking this product! I highly recommend this to anyone getting into shape, beginners and people who have been at it for a while!\n",
      "One of the best proteins I have ever tried , better than ON gold standard ! Taste is great , they did a great job with this\n",
      " I had never had a strawberry-flavored whey product until I tried this one.  I had heard things like it tasted like strawberry Nesquik milk and such, so I figured I’d give it a try.  I was very disappointed.  It had no resemblance to that whatsoever and quite frankly, tasted awful to me.  I can say with confidence that I will not purchase this flavor going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just finished my last tub from 3 for 2 purchase. Generally I really like Cellucor products accept for the expense. This only mixed well in the blender with water. Profile is good and comparable to other top brands, flavor not so much. Will stick with BSN for value and taste\n",
      "There are a lot of chocolate protein powders on the market, what sets cellucors apart from the others? In my opinion, itÃ¢ÂÂs their mixability. The taste is there also, but its so easy to mix is why I like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: 9/10: Chocolate is chocolate. CanÃ¢ÂÂt go wrong with chocolate, but the cellucor protein is very smooth going down and makes it so much better. This protein shake is also good for making desserts. There is such a big variety of protein desserts to make, and cellucor cor performance protein is perfect to make them with because it tastes so good by its self.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability: 10/10: Like I stated above, I love this protein mainly because of the mixability. I use a vortex blender to make my shakes with, which will help blend any kind of powder, but I also use a shaker cup and blender ball from time to time. It mixes awesome and has no clumps and goes down so smoothly its like drinking chocolate water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effectiveness: 10/10: I like to drink protein shakes as a meal sometimes and always after a workout for recovery. This contains 25 grams of protein per scoops, which is plenty.  I like to take 2 scoops post workout and I believe that it helps my muscles recover tremendously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: 9/10: This is good quality protein and has a very good taste. The mixability is great, it helps with recovery and it is also good to bake with so you can make those desserts that wont hurt your diet. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for protein powders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes like vanilla with a slight hint of PB. If you're a PB lover like I am, this flavor is not for you. \n",
      "I am just about done with my tub of this protein and unfortunatly i am not that impressed. I deffinetly expected better flavor and mixability but neither were good, after a while i stopped wanting to drink it, it also upset my stomach The gains i made werent as impressive. I enjoy trutein or ON gold standard much more. I exoected more cellucor\n",
      "Great tasting Protein powder, great price, blends well... no chunks. Whipped vanilla tastes really good! Good macros as well\n",
      " Cookies &amp; Cream: Great taste, very creamy and has little crunchy bits mixed right in. Mixes easy with zero clumps.\n",
      "Cinnamon swirl is hands down the best tasting whey protein out \n",
      "Overall a solid protein powder, although I still prefer ON Gold Standard. Mixes well in milk and water. Molten chocolate tastes AWESOME although I found the peanut butter marshmallow to be a little funky.\n",
      "Absolutely unreal. Macro and amino profile, taste, mixability, price...cannot be beat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes amazing! Just like cinnamon toast crunch. Blends well and digests quickly.\n",
      "usually do not rate but def does not deserve a 9.1... too clumpy.. taste are weird for multiple flavors... def stick to optimum..  i wanted a change of taste so i tried this brand , it was a really bad idea.. will never order again.. thats just my opinion maybe some people actually enjoy this i don't know..\n",
      "\n",
      "taste is okay, but this protein powder mixes terribly with milk. if you plan on using mil to mix with a shake do not buy this product. it will turn thick and sludgy with 8 oz of water and one scoop. on gold standard is a far superior product.\n",
      "This protein powder is one of the WORST proteins I have ever tried. I really like cellucor products but their protein is a FAIL. DO NOT waste your money. The consistency is like pudding, it is so thick and hard to get down, the flavor is not all that great either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the peanut butter marshmallow flavor is incredible. when you mix it with milk its the tastiest thing, a little addictive even. blends well, no chunks. would not recommend it for people who do not like the taste of peanut butter lol.\n",
      "OMG!  I think I just found heaven in a protein powder!  This is the BEST TASTING stuff I've tried.  The funny thing is it doesn't smell good.  When I first opened it and smelled it, it smelled like it was going to taste yucky...NOT THE CASE!  \n",
      "\n",
      "MELT IN YOUR MOUTH, FLAVOR EXPLOSION!!!  I need to try the cinnamon swirl next since it's ranked even higher in taste.  I give this a 10!!!\n",
      "This **** is phenomenal it taste great mixes great and its whey protein so i doubt there is going to be a difference in the helpfulness and increase strength in this from id say op 100% whey.. This product is a def buy i bought the special buy 3 and a super hd for $69 bucks and its the best deal ever they all taste good and its probably as good as 100% gold standard but taste even betterWHOOP WHOOP love this ****ing product wish i could be sponsored by cellucor (Hint Hint) im only 16 though.... But whatever buy this product Trust me best investment for supplements \n",

      "As far as protein flavors go, Cellucor cinnamon swirl is my absolute favorite.  I haven't used it long enough to properly gauge to the formula's effectiveness as I use it to bake with more often than not.  It is low-carb if that is something you're interested in (great for leaning out during spring/summer).\n",
      "Well, just got done w/ my workout and was looking forward to a nice recovery shake.  As I looked at the cover of Cellucor  i was surprised to find only 25 grams of protein.  The Hydro platinum has 30g and was a lot thicker. I guess I should of \"compared\" the two before i made the purchase.. You get what you pay for...  Don't get me wrong taste great, but I'm in it for the ingredients not how well it mixes in a blender, shaker, or water bottle. \n",

      "1 scoop Whipped Vanilla in 6oz of water reminds me of marshmallow creme; perfect for satisfying a sweet tooth! \n",
      "\n",
      "Molten Chocolate is probably the second best tasting chocolate whey I've ever had; compared to the price of the other one (Amplified Wheybolic Extreme 60), this whey is a home run! 8oz of water is the sweet spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "1 scoop ON Vanilla Performance Whey with 1/8th scoop Cor-Performance Whipped Vanilla in 8oz of room temp water is probably the best tasting vanilla protein shake EVER. \n",
      "This is my favorite protein by far... Its great tasting, macro's are perfect...one shake keeps me from getting hungry for up to 3 hours. And did I mention, its great tasting?\n",
      "I wanted to try a different protein besides Gold Standard and I must say, I love this product!. Cinnamon Swirl is the flavor I purchased and i give it a 10/10! My muscles are going to love me for feeding them this product! Grow muscles, grow!\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought this with the deal that included C4. At first the flavors weren't as good as some other proteins I have had since I mix with water, but it grew on me and now I love all three I've tried (CnC, Molten Chocolate, and Strawberry Milkshake). It's an excellent value and I was able to limit the carbs compared to my previous formula. I 2-scoop this for post-workout more often than not, and I truly enjoy mixing the Chocolate and the Cookies and Cream powders with a scoop each. Solid protein, solid price, great taste, and will be buying more.\n",
      "This is the best Protein shake that I have ever used or tasted.  I could drink this all day long if I could.  No grainy texture or bad aftertaste, my only complaint is that they don't have 5 gallon  bucket options!  \n",
      "This powder was strange. Maybe it was just the flavor \"whipped vanilla\" but when the powder was mixed it became way too foamy and airy. It was equivalent to drinking a glass full of beer foam or something like that. I couldn't drink this stuff. It almost seems like Cellucor bottled up a bad batch and called it \"whipped\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Does have great taste, however it is very hard to mix if you don't have a shaker.  Clumps up really badly if you have to stir it.\n",
      "Been stuck on ON Gold Standard for a long time. I won't knock it. Good stuff. But Cellucor knocked this protein out of the ballpark. Great taste (I've tried Cookies n Cream, Strawberry Milkshake, and Molten Chocolate; ALL AMAZING!), perfect for cutting periods as it is low calorie and mixes amazing strictly in water without a bland taste, carb (sugar) count comparable if not better than most other proteins, comparable pricing,.....I could go on. I'm certainly sold on this product. I WILL be buying it again.\n",
      "I received this product about 2 weeks ago, and I love it! It tastes absolutely amazing and I look forward to taking this afer a workout, compared to forcing myself to gulp down other products.  It tastes amazing by itself mixed with milk, I'm guessing it wouldn't be as good with water. It actually tastes like the milk left over after you eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch!\n",
      "Mixes great like the other Cellucor whey protein powders and the taste is pretty decent.\n",
      " Solid profile, just lacking on taste unfortunately for this one.\n",
      "Taste awful\n",
      "This is definitely the only protein powder I will be using from now on. This makes ON whey look like the cheap brand you can buy at convenience stores. I tried the Cookies N' Cream flavor, and it is safe to say this is the best cookies and cream flavor i have ever tasted from any protein. i would rate mixability 9.5/10, taste 9.5/10, and ingredients 9/10. the strawberry milkshake was delicious. Mixed it with some unsweetened almond milk and it literally tastes just like a strawberry milkshake. taste for this one was ridiculous, i would give it a 10/10. The price is a bit more expensive but honestly it is worth the money. If you every have a chance please buy this product, you will not be disappointed!!\n",

      "They taste so good and mix very well in almond milk and water! I've used many protein powder but THIS TASTE AMAZING. And I'm highly sensitive lactose intolerant, this product doesn't bother my stomach much! Would love to buy this product again!\n",
      "This is definitely my favorite protein powder i have tried yet! it tastes way better than any other protein powder i have ever tried, and it is not too pricey\n",
      "Cor-performance whey is my new favorite protein! The price is decent, it mixes well, and it tastes great! My favorite is the cookies and cream by far. It tastes phenomenal and has little cookie bits that make it even better. 10/10. The cinnamon swirl is also really good. I don't think it is better than trutein's cinnabon, but it is still very good. It has a very sweet cinnamon taste. 9.5/10 Finally, the molten chocolate is not the best chocolate protein I have had, but it still tastes great. It is not overly sweet, but still has an enjoyable taste. 8.5/10.\n",
      "Taste is AMAZING! Mixes instantly, and flavor is not overkill. Highly recommend this flavor. Cinnamon Swirl is my 2nd fave. Just ordered the 3 tubs and C4 for 69 buck. Delivery was in 2 days (ground). Thanks Cellucor!\n",

      "TASTE- 10  \n",
      "The product description could not possibly be more accurate. This tastes like a strawberry milkshake with an occassional hint of fresh strawberry (like there are actually chunks of the fruit in it.. but it is completely smooth). Combined with the thick texture this flavor delivers. Strawberry is a very hard flavor to get right.. very few companies have done it well. Cellucor is one of those few.\n",
      "\n",
      "MIXABILITY- 10\n",
      " Wow! This is by far the thickest of the Cellucor proteins that I've tried. Often when a shake is thick it's foamy and or clumpy but that is not the case here. This is a super smooth milkshake/dessert like texture that doesn't go flat. It keeps it's vloume without having to reshake it. Seriously impressed here. I like 4 ozs of milk, 8 ozs of water (plus 3 ice cubes) and two big scoops best.\n",

The only thing I can comment on is the taste which is a 10/10, I bought the cinnamon swirls. I'm not a big believer in buying a protein because it tastes good (thats what a cheat meal is for) however this thing tastes phenomenal. Will re-rate again for effectiveness after 3 months use. But if you are looking for a great tasting protein with a great profile, buy this.\n",

I have tried Met-RX to Combat powder to Optimum Nutrition but I must say Cellucor is the best product I have tasted. Peanut Butter Marshmallow has an amazing peanut butter flavor. Great Product, and cant wait to try my Cinnamon Swirl next!\n",

It has 25g of protein and only 1.5g of fat. I've tried a lot of proteins but I've found one that I'll be sticking with this line for a very long time. Cellucor hit a home run with the COR Performance Whey's.\n",

      "I got the amazing promotion for Cellucor Whey through Bodybuilding.com and chose to order Cookies N Cream, Peanut Butter Marshmellow, and Whipped Vanilla. I ordered Cinnamon Swirl from Amazon a week prior. I tried the Cookies N Cream first. The smell of the Cookies N Cream lets you know this protein is going to taste good. It mixes well either in a blender bottle or standard blender. There are what seems to be real cookie bits in this flavor. The taste is subltle not too sweet. Just perfect. The consistency is thin not thick. I next tried the Whipped Vanilla. It wasnt bad but it wasnt great either. The flavor was faint and not over powering. I am excited to get Cinnamon Swirl and Peanut Butter Marshmellow in the mail\n",
      "Let me start by saying this is the first protein I have purchased that actually mixes with nothing leftover or sitting on the bottom of the shaker. While the taste was decent for C&C, it isn't the best I've had. With that said, this is nothing bad by any means. Its still a good tasting protein! Its not the cheapest product out there, but at the same time, its a label you can trust and there is something to be said for that. I have only tried this with almond milk thus far, but plan to give water a try as well. Never really been a water/protein person so reviewing that would have been irrelevant I suppose. If you're unsure about about your protein purchase, I highly recommend. You may like another flavor more than this one too. \n",

      "Great tasting and texture that doesn't have that granular feeling! \n",
      "The Cocoa Mochaccino tastes great especially when I add ice. However, this valor for me.. personally caused a lot more gas than I like. The chocolate brownie is great.. don't need a ton of water. Personally, the ice can make it taste better but tastes fine without. No gassiness on that flavor. Good amount of protein ratio. Not a lot of carbs, and additives and the additives that it does have.. are the good kind... in just the right amount. Overall a really product, especially with my goal.. \n",
      "Great flavor! Really tastes like melted icecream even when mixed with water. Dissolves easily when mixed with a spoon. Very happy the product :) \n",
      "Loved this product.  It is super easy to just grab a packet and go.  I have a job where I can't necessarily sit down an eat at every meal, or any meal for that matter.  So this is perfect for me.  \n",
      "This product is worth it. It is 100% The Best meal replacement with great results. \n",
      "I found these bars to be very bland in flavor. The texture was very odd and the bars themselves were too chewy for my liking. The macros for them are excellent, along with the fiber. But, would not buy again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice snack bar.  It is actually pretty filling and I have used it for breakfast sometimes.\n",
      "These bars are my all time favorites! The macros are excellent and they taste amazing. I personally loved the cookie dough, but found the cookies and cream to taste a little bland. Still very good though. The texture is also great, they are very soft and chewy with a ton of chunks. Cookie dough is my new go to, wont even bother with quest anymore.\n",
      "Worst protein bar I have ever tried.\n",
      "All Chef bar awesome.!!\n",
      "Not my favorite bar. Looks good on the label, decent taste, but not something I'll buy again.\n",
      "I was looking for something that was comparable to quest bars and I was not as pleased with these as I am with Quest.  The one thing that these miss is the chunks of chocolate and the texture is a little more taffy like with these.  Not a bad bar however, I prefer Quest!\n",
      "Pretty good cleanse.  I don't think its as powerful as the previous formula but works well nonetheless.  I use Great Plains Bentonite Detox on top of this product. I believe the old formula had it included and now it doesn't.  When I use the Bentonite with the clutch cleanse it works super.\n",
      "The ONLY protein powder I have ever tried that seems so pure. Mix it w almond milk and frozen fruit and you have a smoothie that you will crave every morning. No stomach upset, no bloating, pure ingredients. i try to only eat organic meats/dairy, so why compromise on whey protein? Grass fed cows people. Worth the extra cost.\n",
      "They only thing stopping me from giving this a 10/10 is the fact that I live in Australia and the shipping + conversion rate is completely ridiculous ($39.00usd = $53aud not including shipping which is at least $20usd ) I know that this is not anyone's fault in particular, so I only have logistics to blame, but other than that the fact his blends so well with other ingredients without a horrible aftertaste has a consistency of sugar in powder form I honestly cant fault it!\n",
      "I bought this based on the reviews and ingredients. Was disappointed because I could barely choke either flavor down with water and had to switch to unsweetened vanilla almond milk which made it somewhat tolerable. The chocolate is slightly better tasting (with almond milk). I will finish what I have but not purchase again. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have used protein powders for many years.  Most out there contain very bad ingredients and/or stimulants.  I refuse to put chemicals, chicken bones or stimulants into my body and most of those green type of protein powders out there have a horrible taste.   I find that CLUTCH is the best ever for me.  I love the vanilla in the am with frozen berries, nut butters and greens and the chocolate is a fantastic afternoon snack with just water on its own.  I hope that one day soon all CLUTCH products are more available to Canadians.\n",
      "I like how clean the protein is.  The only other protein claiming to be as clean is Bulletproof protein but has about a third the protein per serving.  Clutch Protein Powder blend fast in my little Tribest blender and I can throw it into my shaker bottle and take it with me when I am on the go.  Not over sweet and blends well with a banana and some ginger root and ice.  Thrilled this is available. Will be buying again.  \n",
      "This protein kind of ruined it for other brands.. I love it. I LOVED the flavor, Dark Chocolate, it is not nauseatingly sweet like every other protein I've tried.. It's true to taste. Mixes really well, tastes great,  doesn't upset my stomach at all. My only complaint is the price... 39.99 plus shipping for 1 lb? Way too much for the quantity you're getting.\n",
      "Highest quality protein I've ever used. It's smooth, clean, and as the Clutch team claims, it is the purest whey protein in the world. Worth every cent. Don't waste your money on any product that will only give you half protein and half fillers. \n",
      "This is by far the BEST protein powder I have ever used! The taste is so delicious you can mix it with only water and actually enjoy it instead of endure it. There is ZERO gas or bloat and added BCAA's for your post-workout needs. Love the CLUTCH line. Amazing products and people behind them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've spent about a month of intense internet research (if that counts) on just about every available protein powder out there.  CLUTCH is a stand-out for its unparalleled CLEAN ingredient profile. The vanilla flavor doesn't have much to it, so it's a great choice for adding extras (like peanut butter, fruit, roasted flax, banana, cinnamon, whatever). The chocolate flavor on the other hand - WOW.  Its dark coloring (almost purple out of the bag) threw me for a loop at first. I'm wary of chocolate flavored anything drinks since they almost always disappoint - but this one delivers and THEN some! I look forward to my bedtime CLUTCH chocolate shakes! And like almost all other reviewers, I must add that the \"feeling\" after drinking a Clutch Protein Powder shake is a positive one, both mentally AND physically. No bloating, no upset stomach. I have tried both vanilla and chocolate flavors, and I like them both.  I almost took a point off for the pricing (one of the most expensive proteins out there in its category, comparable to EXOS for example, which is also \"clean\" but expensive), but I'm in this for my health, so I'll cut my budget elsewhere in order to fund my supplements.  CLEAN is the way to go.   \n",
      "So I was hesitant on buying this product, afraid it was just some new gimmick that seemed to good to be true. I am so glad I bought this. It has changed my life. I work out twice a day and  thought my stomach was just sensitive to WHEY proteins like Gold Standard, Muscle Pharm, and Syntha-6... It was constant stomach rumblings all day and bloatedness. WHich I chalked up to just bein g part of the Grind and sucked it up... I tried VegaSport as well but the taste got old quick...\n",
      "\n",
      "Clutch Protein Powder, like others have said, tastes clean and feels great going into your body. My stomach doesnt ever hurt after or rumble, and I just feel full-NOT BLOATED. It tastes delicious, I usually mix with soy/almond milk but water tastes great too. Thank you Clutch for such a great product.\n",
      "Great product.  The vanilla flavored protein powder really doesn't taste good. That is my only complaint, but I fix that on my own by adding an 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon vanilla extract and I'm fine. I just wish the protein powder tasted better without me having to do that. I am seeing the desired results I've only been using the product for 2 1/2 weeks.\n",
      "Clutch Protein Powder is simply the stuff that dreams are made of; scientifically formulated, pure and delectable! I've been a huge supporter of the Clutch brand for over a year and have shouted their praises from the rooftops.  Ashley Conrad continues to lead the proverbial powerhouse pack by providing products that support muscle growth and definition in the cleanest manner imaginable.  Bravo!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Hands down, worst tasting protein powder I've ever tasted, and I've tried quite a few.  Can't say much besides that, as today was my first time using the product, but it was just awful... and I mixed it with coffee, which was completely overpowered by the chalky taste of the protein.  If you don't care about taste, this is the product for you!\n",
      "I normally love the clutch products but flavor is not their strong suit. So after it was listed on the best tasting protein powders I actually ordered and tried it... one of the worst chocolate tasting protein powders I ever tasted. Very disappointing. Should probably be eliminated from the best tasting list.\n",
      "I completely love the Clutch Protein powder. You can taste that it's not filled with crap!!!! It's not too sweet or flavorful. I hate all other products on the market that want to fake the taste of different flavors...they think the crazier it sounds, the better, but not for me. If I could make a whey protein from scratch this is how I would do it = simple. Less ingredients the better and the ones inside are top quality. Everybody here wants to eat healthy, clean and without preservatives. This is the only product on the market that is like that! Straight truth!\n",
      "This protein powder was way better than expected. I got the dark chocolate because Vanilla was out. Usually, I like Vanilla or Chocolate so I can add coffee for some more flavor but couldn't do it to this chocolate flavor because it is SO dark. It is EXTREMELY rich. But, surprisingly, despite the strong flavor this protein was MUCH easier to consume (I used coconut milk) than some other ones. I also like how few ingredients are in this protein and it doesn't make me burp or...the other one.\n",
      "Also, beware: this might be TMI but at first this will make your....movements....a lot more dark because this protein is basically black, don't be frightened, it's just the protein lol.\n",
      "I will be buying more but PLEASE get some Vanilla available BB!\n",
      "This is hands down the best tasting protein powder I have used.  The dark chocolate has an authentic, not-too-sweet chocolate flavor and no chemical aftertaste.  It's got a great mouth-feel and blends easily.  I love it in smoothies or mixed into yogurt or cottage cheese.  I've found that it gives me clean energy and leaves me sated.  I've been developing great muscle using this whey, and I love that it is a clean product!\n",
      "Im a \"clean\" eater myself and tend to stay away from additives in proteins, however I'm big on taste so it is very limited. This product is delicious and I use it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk and also use it for protein pancakes and other fun treats. It reminds me of chocolate milk from childhood. \n",
      "I love how fine the powder is. It mixes very well. I have not had it plain but I've been mixing it with fruit and coconut milk and it's been fantastic! It's not been too thick and tasts great!\n",
      "Hands down best protein powder on the market! I am in love with this stuff. It's so smooth and its tastes like a vanilla cake (vanilla flavor option) I can mix it with just water and can't even tell its in there other than the flavor. I have tried a lot of other protein powders and their texture is horrible and its tastes like chalk. This seriously has no texture at all and tastes so stinking good!!! I've noticed my muscles recover way faster too. Well done Ashley Conrad and Clutch team for creating an amazing product! \n",
      "I really like this one! Very smooth, clean tasting - and there was barely any powder residue on my blender or on my glass. The powder is very fine. Definitely 200% better than the original. Tastes great! \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm gonna keep this short and sweet: I like that this is a very clean product. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the price is to high for the amount of product. \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste, in my opinion, leaves a lot to be desired as well as the texture. I think it is far too thin of a formula but if you like that then you'll love this. I like to mix mine with spinach and flaxseeds and it still pours like water when blended. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: too pricey and not tasty. :( I really wanted to love it. \n",
      "Excited about this whey as I've been searching for a product w/ a minimal ingredient list, and most I've tried cause huge tummy issues.  The flavor is not too sweet, kind of bland, but that's not an issue since the quality/ingredients is more important to me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Love this protein because it causes no stomach problems; the only drawback for me is the cost.  Would likely purchase again; unfortunately just not something I could do regularly at that price.\n",
      "had high expectations after the hype around Clutch and must say was a bit disappointed with this protein powder; sure, the quality is great and I'd rather pay a bit more and have high quality, pure, organically sourced WPI but the taste really isn't impressive. That's to say I'm not one for overly sweet and artificial protein powders (I actually can't stand those) so I was looking forward to a non-artificial cacao taste but it's rather bland I have to say. Won't purchase this again as I think the price is way too high - I use other WPIs with the same high quality, pure, from NZ grass-fed cows with better taste and at a (slightly) cheaper price.\n",
      "Great tasting product, especially chocolate orange.\n",
      "I'm a student and whilst spending hours at uni doing my assignments, just one of these bars kept me hunger-free for hours.\n",
      "Good amount of protein and a reasonable amount of sugar and fat etc.\n",
      "Much cheaper than most protein bars, definitely recommend! \n",
      "This is one of the best products I've tried. Excellent quality and great taste.\n",
      "Great for a meal replacement and keeps you feeling full.  Chocolate Malt flavor was decent. Not the best chocolate flavor i've had if you're looking to take care of a sweet tooth, but still decent.\n",
      "Not the best strawberry flavor .. but definitely better than others (I have had some really bad strawberry flavors).  \n",
      "I do not like to miss a meal, but it is difficult to get the six that you need; with a busy schedule.  This is a great way to replace one of those missed, but greatly needed meals.  It is full of the nutrients that your body needs, along with a great source of protein it provides.\n",
      "\n",
      " You will get your money's worth out of ProMR. Hope this helps.\n",
      "This proetin is a must when it come down to gaining weight. Tastes great and goes down very smooth. A+++ I highly recommend the Propeptide mpf. Overall excellent!\n",
      "This is a great product I've ever had. After a month, I've gained 3 pounds. My metabolism is high and I run and lift weight a lot. I used to try True-Mass, Serious Mass, Russian Bear 5000, etc., but this ProPeptide BMF works for me very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is by far the best weight gainer I have taken so far. No doubt! I gain solid 3lb in my first month drinking it twice a day. I have been taking this weight gainer for the last 3 months and I already gained 12lb! Unbelievable! Great product! \n",
      "this is agreat product and often overlooked.  the ingredients are awesome, it tastes great, and reasonably priced.  i highly recommend this as a postworkout shake and weight gainer.\n",
      "Honestly just a waste of money. It tastes so bad I ended up throwing it away and there was no kick to help me though my workout. Save yourself and your wallet, don't buy this product.\n",
      "I started taking The Curse by Cobra Labs and it wasn't doing enough for me, so I switched to Shadow-X for the extra caffeine boost, and I feel a difference in all my workouts. I also like the fact that this pre-workout has no creature in it, whereas The Curse did. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an extra kick to their workout to help them get more out of themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the first pre-workout that I considered to throw away bc of taste:/   \n",
      "I loved the taste of usual cobra curse preworkouts with lemon or green apple. \n",
      "But this shadow-x tastes terrible. And I was expecting more energy and pump.  Its similar to C4 or Cobra Curse maybe, but not even close to Pre-jym or Legion Pulse. \n",
      "I will probably use Cobra Curse with NO Fury again.\n",
      "Really for hardcore users only if you have never taken pwo's before do not start with this one\n",
      "I really like this Shadow-X Pre workout. It doesn't have that weird floaty pulp stuff that The Ripper or The Curse has...I forget which had that but that made it hard for me to drink. Also, it tastes way better in the Lemon Zero flavor; making it easy to drink and get going. Most importantly, it really works to help with energy, motivation, and focus. After drinking this, it is harder for me to sit still than to do my workout. It doesn't make me feel sick or jittery and it works pretty quickly. I'll order it again.\n",
      "Omg  I love this product is one of the best workouts I've ever tried to anyone it works fast without any jitters and smooth and delicious 👌🏼👌🏼👍🏼😁\n",
      "It's a awesome pre-workout and really gets me going during a hard workout but the two flavours I've tried are really nasty.\n",
      "With most pre-workouts I've used in the past, I've needed 2 scoops for them to be effective. For this one, I've only needed 1 scoop and have gotten great results. First off, the taste is great. After you take it, you get a really clean feeling boost without any scratchy feeling. I would highly recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "Mixes really well. Mot jittery at all. Not a crazy pump from it, but still good. Very good focus and energy boost\n",
      "I love the lemon flavor from \"The Curse\" so i decided to  try this lemon flavor as well. It is just as delicious. I just received this yesterday and tried it before going to the gym after a long 13 hour shift at work. All i'm going to say is that this stuff is amazing. It gave me intense focus and the extra motivation to get a few more reps out during ab day. My girlfriend used it as well and states the same feeling I had. We usually drink it a 20 ish minutes before the gym and on the way there we couldn't stop talking it was insane how crazy hype we got from this. I didnt feel jitters but just extremely energized and focused. I will continue buying this because of how amazing it works. I will be doing updates on the flavors as well because I intend to try all the flavors. COBRA LABS products will be supported by me no matter what they put out, because they always have high quality products that work like they say they do.\n",
      "Just ordered this shadow x, so far it's a great pre workout! The thing I notice most is the intense focus from it, taste isn't the best with the neon tropic but I can look past that.\n",
      "This pre-workout works very well. Outstanding energy, focus, and pump. It's hard to find a preworkout that keeps me going on leg day and this actually makes me squeeze out a few more reps than planned. The pump is very nice also. I tried the curse and liked it so why not try this. It'l doesn't affect my stomach and won't have you reaching for water after every set due to the lack of creatine. I gave a scoop to a few of my friends and they loved it, even more than C4. \n",
      "Loved it, it's my second week for using Shadow-x and still feeling awsome\n",
      "perfect pump strength and energy with no crush, for sure will get more from this product.\n",
      "This is pretty good stuff. The magic berry tastes like a really good jolly rancher but the neon tropic tastes like watered down sand mixed with poorly made kool-aid.\n",
      "This was just an average pre workout. I tried both flavors because they were on sale and I use the cobra labs fat burner and really like it.  This pre workout gives you a nice pump but I prefer to use the fatburner more than the preworkout they make when I go to the gym..\n",
      "Taste wise I would give this product a 0. The only reason I'm giving it an overall  5 is because from the little bit that I could stomach made a big improvement in my workouts. I was focused, energized, and did receive some pump from the little bit I would take. The taste? To me, it tasted like someone had a glass of water and poured a jar of salsa con queso in it......yes. It's tasted like watered down spicy cheese. I would not recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "Very good product and vascularity helps to much for concentration and strength \n",
      "Neon Tropic is horrid - full stop!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried every major pre-workout over the past 10 years and have become a total critic. My tolerance is right up there, so it is hard for me to get a kick out of any pre-workout on the market. This one is a disappointment. Average kick to start the session, however the high concentration of stims + caffeine leads to headaches, nausea, and jitters after an hour, and they last for a fair amount of time after. \n",
      "\n",
      "It has been 2 weeks, and I will persist to the bottom of the tub to see if it gets any easier.\n",
      "Wow !! Truly awesome product. ..\n",
      "Wow! This is an epic pre-workout with massive pumps and insane mental focus.\n",
      "Have used several pwo's over the years and this one ranks towards the top of the pile. Product delivers a nice clean energy with a pretty decent pump.  Doesn't tend to give me the flush or jittery feeling as some pre workouts do; it just kinda creeps up on ya and let's you get to work and go hard in the gym with very little crash afterwards. \n",
      "It's very average. Alright focus, alright energy. Simply it's quite mediocre. \n",
      "another great product from Cobra Labs! cheap, strong pre workout with plenty of punch. The only downside is the fact that it doesn't have any creatine, but i don't mind this. Some pre workout products that contain creatine tend to contain Creatine HCl and other micro dosing creatine products. I prefer to take monohydrate so i can easily add as much creatine as i would like without worrying about taking too much and getting dehydrated.I would recommend this product to anyone taking 2 or 3 scoops of a more expensive pre and wasting cash! chicken breast costs enough! \n",
      "As predrink works poorly as a pump generally *******...concentration and focus is the same no! In General I do not advise to take!\n",
      "This was the first pre workout that I purchased for myself, and boy did I make a good decision. I have bummed tons of C4 off my friends, and used other types as well. This pre workout was different, there was no jitters or insanity, just a calm relaxed feel. I felt myself looking down a narrow corridor, getting ready for the pump of a lifetime. Once you start working out, you feel like you are at home. It's a really great pump, and there is a really unique sensation of a pause during a hard rep, then the ability to simply overcome all odds and get it up. I really didn't like the taste when mixed with water, but found that when mixed with Hawaiian Punch it was absolutely delicious.  All in all, a great pre workout, will most likely be purchased again. <3 HAPPY GAINZ\n",
      "Absolutely phenomenal pre-workout. I used to use C4, but half-way through a workout I'd feel burnt out, so I decided to try something new. Shadow-X (both flavours) had good reviews and was actually priced really well. Wow. My workouts have become way more intense and I feel I can get so many more reps in after my muscles start to burn. Definitely buying again!\n",
      "This was my first pre workout after cycling off for a month, I've been taking just one scoop for the past 3 weeks now and I still get the same effect every time! Unlike c4 or any other pre workouts, my body did not build a tolerance to this stuff. My focus in the gym is amazing, can power through an entire workout with only half minute breaks. The flavours are delicious, I could eat this stuff raw out of the tub. I highly recommend this to someone in their contest prep stage. No creatine, no jitters, just pure clean energy from a company that I can always trust. Give this stuff a try and you won't be dissapointed!\n",
      "Tried a sample tub of this, it's one of the strongest pre-workouts i've used. Awesome for focus and it kicks in really fast after drinking, was only about 10-15 minutes for me. Definitely would recommend if you want something strong, probably not to someone who hasn't used a stim based pre workout before.\n",
      "There is only 30 servings per tub, but it's got 350mg of caffeine per serve so i tried a heaped scoop and that was all i needed. I've used The Curse before, this seems to be a lot stronger, i trained back and it was full noise for the whole workout.\n",
      "Had to get this when it first came out and got really excited to try it . \n",
      "My first workout was the curse so  seeing this as a more \"savage\" version caught me.\n",
      "(I tried plenty of other PWO's)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I have to say that this pre workout could sometimes be too intense, like if I take it too often I crash 30 mins into the workout and lose all my focus..\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy Levels: 8/10 you can definitely feel it in you and it will help you get that one more rep.\n",
      "Focus: As I said it varies I'll give it 10/10 because generally the focus is just great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pump: 10/10 now this is what I LOVE about this PWO the pumps are huge , probably the biggest ones I got using pre workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is decent just not my type. Blends with no problem neither.\n",
      "Got sent a sample tub of this early. Thanks to Lemon Rush for sending it out. First impressions is that the label is awesome, quite different from The Curse. Mixes well in water and tastes good. No nasty after taste. One thing I noticed was it started to work quickly. Maybe about 10-15 minutes and I was ready to go. I was looking for something a bit strong in my pre workout and this doesn't disappoint. I could easily have 2-3 scoops of some other formulas but 1 scoop of this was ideal.    My workout on it was great too a nice clean buzz and no upset stomach. My next tub will be a tub of this.\n",
      "My friend gave me a scoop of this before a workout yesterday, first time i've ever tried a pre trainer, i've only used energy gels and bars in the past for mountain biking and MotoX.\n",
      "I can see why these pre trainers are so popular now, i worked out harder than i have since i was in my 20s. I've just purchased a full tub and i'm looking forward to trying out a few of the others on here as well.\n",
      "got nothing from this product, ive tried a few here and there, only thing cool about this is the security tab, very weak product\n",
      "Energy and focus as promised on the label. A great pre. My only complaint is the coloring used. First one ever to stain my shaker bottle. Pink. Maybe cut out the artificial coloring in future batches?\n",
      "I have tried between 5-10 different pre workouts ( c4, bsn, assault, 1mr, cutler, mr hyde, etc. ). This is the best preworkout ive ever had. I was taking the curse the last 6 months. I was using 2 scoops and it worked pretty good when it came to energy. The green apple was good the watermelon made my stomach upset. Shadow x gave me the most energy ive ever had off a pre workout and i also had a tremendous amount of focus. It took about 15 minutes to hit me but when it did, it hit me like a train. I had a great workout and the energy lasted a good 50 minutes before it started slowing down. Every other pre workout i had only lasts about 30 mins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only 2 negative things I have to  say is \n",
      "1. If you are using a water bottle, you have to shake it pretty hard or it comes out clumpy.\n",
      "2. The flavor wasnt the greatest but i drink it about 15 mins after brushing my teeth so maybe it is better than i thought.\n",
      "Overall the good definitely weighs out the bad. This stuff is incredible. Best preworkout ive ever had.\n",
      "I have used several pre-workout mixes (C4, Neon, assault, and others) over the years. For the past two months I have been using The Curse by Cobra Labs. It has been an overall good product. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then I saw their new product Shadow, the ingredients seem to double in certain areas and after reading some reviews. I wanted to try it. \n",
      "\n",
      "People say between 10/15 minutes they feel it working, it took probably around 35 min for me to feel it working (the tingling, which I like) and I will work out. It is true to its word, I love working out with it. Your focus is spot on. You always feel like you really can do that next rep. And there is no drop off. \n",
      "\n",
      "However this morning when I took it I felt nothing, except sleepiness, but when I started my warm up, BOOM, I felt it. \n",

      "I have tried all the flavors and the peanut better and dark chocolate/sea salt are my favorites! They are literally like flavored rice krispy treats! The texture is perfect and there is NO aftertaste. I have one for breakfast everyday!  My favorite bars, hands down!\n",
      "I am so pleased that I tried this product. I love the Dark Sea Salt and the Peanut Butter the best!  My family tries to eat these so I have to admit I now have a secret hiding place for them!!  When I placed my next order I ordered several extra boxes for them and the too love them. My youngest son keeps them at his dorm for before/after his training sessions. Great product- Keep up the great work!\n",
      "\n",
      "All 3 flavors are absolutely awesome. My personal favorite is Dark Chocolate Blueberry Almond. The blueberry flavor pairs perfectly with the dark chocolate. I purchased these bars at a local grocery store and am extremely pleased to find they are available at bodybuilding.com for such a great price! Love these for a mid-afternoon snack with significant protein that keeps me feeling full with the 7g of fiber. Highly, highly recommend for anyone looking for a great tasting protein bar with excellent ingredients.\n",
      "Bought these to have a snack throughout my busy day with work and working out.  These are so good.  Easy on the calories and good bit of protein.  My kids starting eating them too for school and before and after their sports activities.  My family is a big fan.  Thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste so amazing and surprising filling! I'm gluten and dairy intolerant so this bar is literally heaven sent. It has traces of dairy but doesn't harm me at all. These and quest bars are half my diet hahaha BUY THEM! \n",
      "This is more like a candy bar than a protein bar. Delicious chocolate coating, soft peanut butter center, with pretzels on top. Really awesome macros as well. Only complaint is there was just 2 small pretzels on the end of the bar when they could have fit probably 5 on top. Pretzels that were on top were stale. Will still try other flavours though!\n",
      "basically it's a yummy candy bar, i forget it even has protein it's so good\n",
      "This is by far the worst protein bar I have ever tasted. I saw them on sale, so I decided to try them and I bought 4 boxes... That was the worst mistake of my life. I felt like I wasted my money. They do not even compare to the taste, texture, and quality of other brands on Bodybuilding. The bars I have are extremely hard and tough on the inside, almost hard to chew and swallow. The taste is not good, I am str****ling to finish my 4 boxes. I would rather buy the costco protein bars then spend any money on these. I highly recommend that you avoid these bars. There are MANY other better brands out there.\n",

      "This is pushing a 9, but I'll never give anything a perfect 10, so an 8 for me is great. Better tasting than expected. For the amt of grams of this, good amt of Calories (>300), carbs (>30g, with some fiber), and protein (generally >24g). None of the ones I tried are \"chewy.\" Easy to eat. \n",
      "Taking this with AM/PM casein, pre-lift whey, and this is my post-lift bar. That combo has not produced gains for me in the past beyond very modest thickness gains (I'm an ectormorph). Recently added a weight gainer to the mix, so we'll see how that goes with this along for the ride. May update later. \n",
      "Great taste, good macros. Excellent product\n",

      "I'm convinced that every single one of these reviews were written by employees of the company. I bought these because I was looking for something different and these were highly rated.\n",
      "\n",
      "They taste like any other protein bar you can get at your local grocery store for $2.50. Bland, artificial tasting, and chewy. The ingredients are nothing special. These are no where close to the taste and quality of Quest Bars. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like I was duped by buying these. \n",
      "these taste great but are a bit chewy and wear on your jaw a bit. Good macros though. Try em yourself and find out!\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste way better than quest. Wish they had more variety, not that i ever get tired of caramel pretzel\n",
      "I really enjoyed the Come Ready bars.  The Caramel Pretzel Crunch reminded me of a Snickers bar.  I was a little disappointed with the Cake Batter and the Cookies and Cream flavors.  The Cake Batter bar, in my opinion, only had a slight cake batter flavor.  Almost like a protein shake with Cake Batter powder that has too much liquid and not enough powder.  I would however buy each flavor again.\n",
      "I take this for an afternoon snack. The taste is outstanding. Very pleased with this product. \n",
      "\n",
      "These bars do have some substantial beneficial ingredients that are a great pre-workout meal for you to \"be ready\" for your workout. The taste is above average but is mildly chewy due to the whey protein within it. I am satisfied with the product.\n",
      "It absolutely IS the best tasting protein bar I've ever had, but then again that's probably because it's as much a chocolate bar as anything else.  While you can't complain about 24g of protein, you can just make a whey shake or down a rtd and get the protein while skipping the 13gfat and the sugar in the bar ... and those might be on the low side if you read some articles about the REAL contents of most \"protein bars\".    \n",
      "Best tasting bar I have had.  Like eating a fat (no pun intended) Twix bar.  \n",
      "Best tasting bar I've ever had. Caramel tastes kinda like a Twix. Peanut butter tastes like Reese's. Cake batter kinda tastes like cake batter, just very sweet and a little more chewy. I would recommend the first two flavors to anyone looking for a bar they want to enjoy for the benefits and taste. \n",
      "This is one of the best tasting pro-bars I've had with the amount protein per serving. This will definitely be my bar of choice. \n",
      "One of the better protein bars I've had. Nice combination of flavors and good amount of protein.\n",
      "By far the best tasting protein bars out there!  Great meal replacement as a tradesman on the go gotta love them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome tasting and it's a filling snack.\n",
      "It's not very good in 30 degrees + due to chocolate melting, but you may use some time in a refrigerator to make it tastier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste amazing! Fills your stomach when you're hungry.\n",
      "Surprisingly the best tasting protein bar I've ever tried. I recommend it to everyone. The caramel pretzel crunch is the bomb, and the chocolate peanut butter is close second.. Gotta try 'em all. \n",
      "Didn't really liked the taste of thisbars.\n",
      "Bar was filling but was not a fan of the flavor. \n",
      "DROOLING!!!!  the best tasting bar ever! I have these on hand for when things are needed by my sweet tooth. put the bar in you freezer and eat it once froze. your welcome! this one taste just like a TWIX!!! LOVE IT\n",

      "I love this natural testosterone booster. Unlike many other products on the market, this one is made-up of 3 very well-known ingredients that will definitely help you achieve better results in the gym! Many other test boosters have dozens of ingredients (sometimes with mixed research about their effects) that still can't compete with Blue Up! This product is also great for helping one bring their natural testosterone production back in range after a more PH oriented cycle. Great as stand-alone or in combination with your other favourite supplements. Take an hour before you hit the gym, and get ready for take-off ;)!\n",

      "For those interested in CLA, I purchased this product, one for the price, bogo is always a plus. Second because I've taken CLA before. Train hard and stick to clean diet is the best way to see clear results of ANY product.(my opinion) Lost 3inches of fat in my mid section, stayed cut even though i was bulking up, (clean diet). Results were noticeable when I was halfway thru the second bottle. I stock up on this product because of the bogo. Thank you for reading  \n",
      "My appetite increased for some reason while taking these which i had to resist. After taking the 90 pills i lost 5kg which i cannot contribute directly to CLA (diet and Working out) but i can without a doubt say these help tremendously! I haven't tried a CLA product before so i am a newb to it but i truly felt its effects. I had more energy too some reason which went away when i stopped. Value is about a 8/10. No burps or gross flavours. Overall a great product you should try 8/10.\n",
      " Fair price, but definitely try to score it on a sale like I did, totally worth it!\n",
      "Reviewing a product like this is difficult because you can't exactly pinpoint if the results you achieve are because of the product itself or good diet and workout routine. Overall, I've lost a lot of fat while taking CLA (6 of these caps/day). Its a staple in my cutting diet.\n",
      "This a top of the line additive you can add to ANY pre workout. The pumps with this product is so terribly great that it hurts so good. I highly suggest it to those who look for more pump!\n",
      "no extra energy\n",

      "very good.\n",

      "Started out taking only one scoop and didn't see or feel much difference. I read the reviews and upped it to 2 scoops for the first time on arms day....whoa! I biceps and triceps felt like my skin wasn't big enough to contain them. This was very motivating for me and made me want to lift more and harder. Now I take it on arms, chest, legs and back days to experience the impact. This is a serious product and I highly recommend it!\n",
      "I truly have nothing negative to say about this product.  GG2 mixes great, no clumping or grains left over.  It provides exactly what it advertises.  More vascularity, pumps and I am pushing weight, while maintaining form for a few extra reps.   This is an awesome addition to my stack.  For reference, I am stacking this with White Flood, ARA and Yohimbine.\n",
      "This is my first try at Glycerol and this product delivers. First, it's an incredible price. Very affordable! It mixes very easily. I add it to a PWO or a BCAA if working out fasted. It doesn't clump and I can't taste it. This is one of the few pump products that I have found that really work. And with Controlled Labs, it's a quality product from a good company. \n",
      "its ok, didn't get the feeling I get from taking C4.\n",
      "Wow.  The flavour is unreal for a supplement, and I enjoy drinking the mix.  I've only ever taken Purple K in the pill form, but I find that Green Mag gives me gastro issues, and negative side effects.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely recommend this product.  I've already ordered my second tub. \n",
      "Definitely does what it says it'll do. Noticed a quick increase in my reps and strength \n",
      "\n",
      "Great Creatine. 1RM's keep increasing quickly, putting on more mass, not much bloat or discomfort . Would definitely recommend this.  \n",
      "Beware of \"Electric Lemonade\" flavor, unless you enjoy embibing powdered urinal deodorizer blocks. This is by far the worst smelling and tasting creatine supplement\n",
      "The taste of it is pretty good. It's good to sip on, I don't personally like to throw it back because it tastes that good.  One thing is that it settles, but what creatine doesn't do that.  I purchased a 40 and received a 10 serving tub for free, which was nice, and so far I have not gained weight, but I can lift more weight for more reps.\n",

Its a good creatine, now im trying it as a post workout before my protein shake. Now i use j****ernaute like preworkout, but i think i will try another creatine after this one. Trying to get more muscle mass (i want try creapure creatine from allmax)\n",
      "But overall its good but a little expensive.\n",
      "UPDATE. After many use, stomach issue with this creatine.. Now i have the allmax creatine annd for now this one is more soft on my stomach\n",
      "Green MAGnitute or Green Mag for short is one of the best all around creatine supplements available. Packed with extra quality ingredients and Green Mag doesn't use creatine mono, for some this is a plus as I'm also someone who notices bloat if I take creatine mono.\n",
      "About 2 weeks in on this product and I'll start with my only 2 minor critiques...taste is not the best and the mixability could be much better.  Tends to stay clumped unless I give it a thorough shaking multiple times.  Having said that, on to the good, or in this case, great!\n",
      "\n",
      "Noticing some BIG differences in the amount of weight I'm putting on the bars and machines!  Definitely feel myself getting MUCH stronger!  I have gained 3 lbs since taking this, but as of now, not a bloated weight that Creatine monohydrate tends to do.  I think it is more muscle weight.  I will write a review once I am 1/2 through the bottle, but so far so good!\n",
      "A little on the pricey side but mixes extremely well.. not a huge fan of sour things but everyone raved about this flavor so I tried it and it's actually really good I will be looking to try the lemonade flavor to see how they compare.. definitely recommend this as it's my first go with  full out creatine product and have had no issues\n",
      "been using this product for about 2 months now..ive seen a lot of change as far as strength, muscle building, and boost...I have increase reps and weight lifted all around..i do cardio for fat lost, but hit the weights hard...biceps went from 20 inches to 23 inches in 2 months of use...boomshakalaka to green mag....\n",
      "I have tried a sample of this product from CL Sample pack promotion. After just trying it once, I end up ordering tons...6 tubs from Buy 2 get 1 Free. Now that I have tried Green Mag, I shall never consume unflavored boring creatine! This stuff is delicious and dissolves completely in water unlike the normal Creapure sold by many. Normally I'm not a fan of Watermelon but this flavor was done just right for my tastes so I end up ordering 2x Watermelon and 4x Sour Green Apple(Just completely tasty). Aside from creatine mixing and tasting so good, it also has additional energy ingredients which helps fuel workouts or need to wake up a bit. I take Green Mag every morning, I feel more energized during the mornings and ready to train hard. \n",
      "Love the watermelon flavor. Pairs well with the controlled labs white flood pre-workout. Muscles definitely feel fuller while lifting and for a few hours afterwords. \n",
      "Best possible creatine supp ever. Tried many and never got half as good results as with GM. Strenght, muscle fullness. You can;t go wrong with it. Heads and tails above all the competition.\n",
      "Solid designer creatine, dissolves easy and the taste is fantastic mixes very good with white flood reborn has nice extra's,  and makes for some very tasty green mag-sicles! :)\n",
      "i have been using this product for over month and have noticed difference in strength and endurance. i take it daily at 1 scoop, first few days had a bit of stomach issues but nothing that caused me to run to bathroom. the flavor is mild sour taste not really sour at all imo. it has helped with adding reps for example  i was benching 225lbs for 3 reps now i can do 8. you do retain some waterweight for me its mostly in my arms. its the only creatine that has actually worked for me.\n",
      "ive tried many different creatines but i keep coming back to cl green mag.  ive tried all 3 flavors and each of them is equally delicious\n",
      "By far one of the best creatines I've ever used! I take it before my workout and the extra ingredients make a difference it only took me a week to see the extra reps in my sets and mix ability and taste is Great! \n",
      "Hands down the best creatine I have ever tried. I have had really no luck with creatine in the past, as I've tried many and always would end up with moderate to sever G.I. distress, and I was eating very well and staying hydrated and drinking plenty of water so my diet was not a factor. I had just about given up on creatine, but I heard of this type in it, the Creatine Magnesium Chelate I believe, and was interested. The creatine is bonded to magnesium, which has a high bioavailabilty, and enhances absorption.  And yes it does enhance absorption. Not once have I had any G.I. distress with this, it tastes delicious, has an amazing value(80 servings for $ 40) and has a very impressive ingredient list. I have seen some major gains, it has helped me get more ripped I have noticed, definite increases in lean muscle. My favorite creatine.\n",
      "I did not like the flavor of the watermelon, it was a burden for me to drink the whole thing. \n",
      "Great deal for a must have in your supplement stack. Creatine is a basic that everyone should be using. This product tastes great and has some nice additions that should help in the gym. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been taking Green Mag daily for a bit over a week. I was looking to try creatine, but always stayed away because of the bloat factor that comes with it. Two of my friends (back in the late 90's) took creatine and just looked chunky/fat rather than muscular. Anyway, after searching the forums & hearing rave reviews about GM and how it was less likely to bloat I ordered a tub. As far as taste, the sour green apple is not the best imo. I go with near 20oz. of water to tame the sour flavor. Everyone else seems to think it's great. I don't mind it since I hear unflavored creatine is pretty bad.\n",
      "I take green mag post-workout with 1MR being my pre-workout. The combo is good because the energy components of green mag keep you functional after a tough workout. So far I haven't seen any sign of bloating, but I have had a gradual increase in strength during my workouts this week compared to last. I'm definitely happy that I chose this over plain mono creatine, and glad that it hasn't given me any stomach issues or other side effects so far. Another great product from CL.\n",
      "This is my favorite creatine product. I had tried a few different types a couple years ago when I started to regularly hit the gym and was never really impressed. I had stopped taking creatine all together until about six months ago when I was recommended to try Green Magnitude at a local health food store. It seemed superior to any others that I had tried in effectiveness, mixability, significantly less bloating and taste. I even found a slight aid in focus with this. This is my favorite creatine that I've tried so far.\n",
      "I have a very sensitive stomach and this does not make me retain water nor hurt my stomach and cause bloating.  Great product!!!\n",
      "Great creatine supplement. I didn't get any bloat from this creatine and my strength went up. The taste is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used the trial size of this product and man, amazing pumps who lasted long, muscle fuel and lot of strength. I bought this product to see if it was just a placebo but not, this is the real deal! Gained 4 pounds of muscle in 1 month using the 40 servings, increased all my series and reps!\n",
      "Already coming another one to me!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great tasting creatine powder by CL. Took advantange of the buy 2 get 1 free deal and the stash lasted about 3-4 months. Definitely picked up strength gains throughout it's use.\n",
      "prefect taste for creatine.\n",
      "Another product by controlled labs i am very happy with. Easy to drink with a light flavor and mixes perfect 10/10. Not a fan of strong tasting drinks before a workout and this is perfect because the taste is very light. All around great product. \n",
      "I'm an avid Controlled labs user. They are easily, and always have been, my favorite company. So it was a no brainer when I wanted to try creatine, to go with Cl's Green MAGnitude. I must say, the size gains I received during this time were pretty great. I was mixing a 1-1 ratio of this with my white flood, and it even tasted great. There's nothing bad I can say about this product. I had significant size gains from it, and significant strength gains as well. IF you're on the fence about creatine, I would definitely recommend this. \n",
      "I have found some great gains from this product in terms on my muscle size and strenth. Give it about 2 weeks and you will really start to notice the results. Just make sure you drink pleanty of water while on this product.Its by far my favorite cretine product i have ever used and will buy again. Also, not that taste is a big factor with me, i have to say it tasted great and went down very easily. Price is reasonable too.\n",
      "taste okay. not my favorite\n",
      "decent creatine , great taste\n",
      "Great taste and mixes easy. Have gained 10 lbs in 3 weeks\n",
      "This one is BooooooooooooooooooooooooM. The energy is incredible. It's like I'm on steroids. By one week I noticed the gains !!!!!!!\n",
      "Works very well as a muscle builder, takes a few weeks to really get into your system. I won't produce miracles, but does produce noticable strength gains over time. The Green Apple is excellent tasting. Very easy on the stomach as well.\n",
      "Taste is perfect, just like lemonade. The blend is powerful! One of the best creatine formulas IMO. I noticed significant increase in my time to muscle fatigue and strength regeneration compared to regular micronized creapure creatine. CLabs is quality!!\n",
      "Just tried it today and wow does it work. Broke a couple of records at the gym today and pushed extra reps great stuff. the taste was a little ehh but i can get use to it\n",
      "This is probably one of my top 2 supplements. I get great pumps and the taste is phenominal. I add a little more water than they say, else it's too sweet.\n",
      "amazing product my bench went up like 25 pounds on this really good strength gains, and no bloating, only thing id do id tell the company to reduce the magnesium to like 250 mg so if u wanna take 2 scoops itll be easier and less trouble going to the restroom, and maybe some beta alanine but overall great product.\n",
      "My favorite creatine! Awesome focus and awesome price tag!\n",
      "Mono creatine made me blot, this stuff has not. Great product!!\n",
      "Price Value: 8/10 At $39.99 for 80 scoops that is 49 cents per scoop.  After the 10% off code if you order from bodybuilding.com your total would be 36 dollars without shipping and handling.\n",
      "Wow, absolutely impressed by this product. Used it last night for the first time. I felt I could lift forever, great engergy and stamina during my workout. I combined it with Green Magnitude last night. Both tasted great, did not get bloated feeling like I do with other combos I tried. I compare this to Evolution/Armageddon, Superpump/Sizeon, JetFuse/Cellmass. Those are the combos I have been on and tried since Feb 2009. I will have to say I am now a Controlled Labs customer, this stuff rocks and you cannot beat the price!\n",
      "Great srength gains and the taste is great.\n",
      "Tried Green Mag a little while ago because I wanted to give one of the &quot;other&quot; types of creatine a shot. For me personally, GM was just as effective as Mono, but I seemed to have more of a sense of increased energy while on GM that I did not see while on regular Mono. Also, the taste is amazing either by itself or mixed with other products. If I had the cash, I would use GM exclusively as my creatine supplement. For now, I am just sticking with the tried and true creapure mono.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried both the flavors of Green Magnitude.  I guess it's all personal preference, but for me.. The electric lemonade, hands down beats the sour apple.  I'd suggest to try both and see what you like, can't go wrong with either. Both are great tasting, but this one has a more zesty taste that'll get you going before a workout.  I use 1 scoop a day, workout days and non. It has 80 servings, and one tub will last almost 3 months!  I can't count the numbers of times I've ordered other creatine supplements in the past, needing to buy a new tube in less than one month..  It gets costly, and this one is cheaper than a lot of other brands.  It mixes great and taste great.  A solid product that gives you lots of value!\n",
      "Green MAGnitude Review\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a new creatine, this is where you stop. Green MAG blew my mind with how well it worked. With basic creatine mono, and even other designer creatines, I've never really been impressed. I'll see slightly noticeable endurance or strength gains that I might as well attribute to me just working hard in the gym. However, the benefits of this product were very apparent, and I noticed myself pushing with strength and energy that I've never had before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall Taste: 9/10\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sour Green Apple flavor of this product is almost like candy. For the first couple weeks I would actually look forward to drinking it, as it was one of the only good tasting things I was consuming during the day. The only thing keeping it from a 10 is the fact that I could never really zero in on exactly how much water made it taste best. The less water you use, the sweeter it becomes, but I never found a good balance.\n",

      "\n",
      "Strength Benefit: 10/10\n",
      "\n",
      "With this product I was pushing weight that I was previously struggling with. After about two weeks, Green MAG started to really kick in, and I noticed myself attacking each exercise as if it were my first for the day. I was increasing the weights of my lifts by at least 10 pounds per week (incline bench, decline bench, deadlift, bent over rows). With the strength I got from this stuff I was able to continuously push myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Endurance Benefit: 10/10\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my weakest areas is endurance. I have the strength, but I often fail to utilize it long enough to make any real gains. For the 2 months I used this product, I didn't fail on a SINGLE SET, whereas I would fail at least one set of any bench press variation. I was still pushing myself with the same intensity but I would notice at the times I would typically feel my arms give out I would have an extra boost that was completely uncharacteristic of me. If there was one standout effect from this product, it was endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Recovery Benefit: 7/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing noteworthy in this aspect. I still felt the same after my workouts as I usually do. If I had felt as though I could attack biceps the day after I had already done so, I would give this rating a 10, but that was not the case. I still felt pretty sore after a good workout and it lasted a couple days. This is normal, so I didn't notice any changes from Green MAG in that aspect.\n",

      "Not a fan of the mint flavor, it's not terrible but a little strong. It is worth it though due to the good contents of the product. A good mix of greens\n",
      "This stuff in amazing. The spearmint taste is super refreshing. I have it as part of my breakfast and mix it up with water and a couple ice cubes. Probably going to blend it up with ice when summer hits. A must have for those who don't eat enough greens.\n",
      "This stuff tastes great IMO. I don't know what people are complaining about but to each his own. Goes down easy, taste great, great energy and I feel great during the day and especially during my workouts. I would definitely recommend this. \n",
      "I think it tastes great! I found that it is best made up as warm drink rather than as a cold one. Mix it with about 4oz of warm water and toss it back in 2 or 3 swallows. I have it every morning.\n",
      "This has to be the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life. I've tried mixing it with protien powders and it's still unbearable. It has a strong spearmint flavor at first but the after taste makes me want to vomit. I even tried to choke it down holding my nose. I should have know spearmint was a bad idea.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While this product mixes extremely well, the taste is SO bad I have to hold my breath while I chug it! I literally feel like they based this off of a poor quality toothpaste.....\n",
      "And some have said that when it is mixed w their protein powder it gives it a nutty flavor....BS\n",
      "Now I'm just wondering should I throw it away or just suffer through it\n",
      "I love green products and I usually go between this and amazing grass. Energy level is up throughout the day. I usually put matcha powder with this as well and it has a 1-2 punch of energy and taste. Overall this product taste amazing by itself but then again everyone does have different taste preference. That being said, i wish the ingredient profile wasn't so under-dosed (per scoop). \n",
      "At first the flavor was a little weird but I've become accustomed to it. Since developing a taste for it I started adding it to hemp protein in the morning which adds a nutty flavor. I've definitely seen an increase in energy since taking this product so I'll continue purchasing. I'm very happy with all of the Controlled Labs products I've tried.\n",
      "Very refreshing!  Was surprised I liked the flavor and it gives me energy!\n",
      "Having tried many greens drinks, this is by far Excellent.  After a few weeks, I can honestly say that my body craves this.  I take 1 scoop per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "My bp bottom numbers has dropped over 15 pts since being this for just 1.5 weeks.   Before it was 95-105.  Now it's no higher than 80.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has almost a candy flavor.   It can be a VERY TINY bit grainy, and mixes VERY quickly.   The taste and mixture is very unique.  You will not be able to mix anything with this drink.  I say this because like many of us, we have so much stuff to drink down.   LOL\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't see myself without this product, it's honestly that good.\n",
      "I could not stand the taste of this stuff when I first started taking it. I started to mix it with my chocolate protein shakes and it changed everything for me. I usually take a scoop in the morning right before I leave for work and it seems to give me some good energy. I could tell a huge difference on the days I don't take it. I would recommend this to people who want to get more of their greens in their diet because I know I am not eating nearly enough greens. Good product.\n",
      "Taste is better than most comparable products. All you have to do, in my opinion, is add a very small amount of fruit juice (couple of ounces will do it) and it really tastes great. I went a month and did not buy it (I do 2 servings a day) and I found myself craving it. From now on I won't go without it.\n",
      "Spearmint was awful. I cant give a full product review because I really couldn't get past the taste.\n",
      "EDIT - Taste became good after extended usage, really works great, i feel like i can breathe better, like my body is just working better to digest my food daily. and i do feel a slight \"Natural\" boost of energy shortly after taking this. Will buy again! \n",
      "Loved the anti ox and how it cleanned my system, be forewarned \" read label and take the initial one scoop recomended for this product then build your tolerance. Just depends on ones body, and how healthy they are prior to taking. :-)\n",
      "Flavour wasn't the worst ever but was hard to get down at times. I know this is a supplement and sometimes people hold them to a different standard but this stuff was not a pleasure to drink at all. As far as the ingredient list, it's fairly good which is why I purchased it. Would not purchase again based on the other options available but the price was decent which is why I picked it up. \n",
      "This is my ultimate favorite drink. Love the spearmint taste, and always gives me a burst of energy. It helps me out to get all of my fruits and veggies too.\n",
      "Cheap and effective greens product. It tastes great when mixed with various protein powders.\n",
      "I've used a tub of this to supplement my average diet &amp;amp; found it very good. To overcome the horrible taste I recommend drinking it either (a) with hot water as a type of herbal tea, or (b) mixed in with chocolate protein shakes/smoothies, giving it a nice choc-mint flavour (for Australian consumers it tastes like a Mint Slice chocolate biscuit!). I would use it again &amp;amp; recommend it to anyone who is considering using it. Overall 10/10. Taste 5/10.\n",
      "Review is a 7 due to the taste of the product. I understand the idea that it is beneficial with all that is in it but the flavor is awful. It is just absolutely awful. I would have preferred a regular/plain taste that would occur just from the ingredients in it rather than the spearmint mixture that is used. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end though, can't really complain about the price/servings.\n",
      "\n",
      "worth every penny of the cost!! taste is gooooddd\n",
      "This is by far the best greens supplement on the market, mixability was a 10/10. Found this to acctually mix better than most pre workouts. No grit left over or gritty texture while drinking it. The taste is 10/10 because it tastes like spearmint gum but not a bitter taste a really sweet mint taste. Drinking this you wouldn't even be able to tell it was a greens drink. The profile is very top notch and the mixability, taste and energy you get from this is even better. Amazing product \n",
      "Very good!! For this cost is the best. Good absorbtion without any side effect. I dont like spearmint taste, but this absolutely another 10+.\n",
      "great company...they get back to you fast...back up their stuff with facts\n",
      "Didn't even get to see if i Felt the effect of the actual supplement, took it for the first day and barely could drink the thing, taste was just horrible...\n",
      "Good minty taste that isn't too strong.  Excellent way to get nutrients on days when my diet isn't up to par.  \n",
      "Great product at a great price. What more is there to say?\n",
      "Awesome taste and great product! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " The flavor however could not be described as enjoyable. The spearmint and orange mix tastes like some experimental jellybean that you would only try once, or the worst mix of chewing gums put in your mouth at the same time. It may be the most aweful tasting thing you ever try.\n",
      "Tough to tell how well products like this work, but I drink this throughout the day mixed with an amino acid supplement (ON Amino Energy - Orange) and really like it. Tastes great (mixes much better with other flavors than I expected) and helps me meet my goals for veggies/greens/antioxidants.\n",
      "I started taken this to get more greens into my system. I don't shy away from green foods but I don't get enough in my diet. The taste is a spearmint aftertaste. It's not great but it's acceptable compared to what it's covering up. I don't plan on moving to any other products as this one gets the job done. This stuff can be strong so you should start with a half a scoop and let your body adjust.\n",
      " And the taste? I was EXTREMELY pleasantly surprised. It is very tea-like and sweet. I found it to taste even better with more water (diluting it further). I mix this with my creatine powder and AAKG powder so imakes the perfect pre-workout drink!\n",
      "What can I say about this product? Well simply it's amazing IMO. I have been taking this product for several months now and I can say that I have experienced an increased sense of well being, and better digestion. The ingredient profile is perfect for someone like me who doesn't get all their fruits and veggies in everyday. The taste isn't the best but I use it to with Ultra Fiber DX to mellow out the taste\n",
      "Infinitely better tasting than other vegetable supplements I have tried. In my opinion this type of supplement is a largely untapped resource, both for supplement companies and for bodybuilders. One scoop of Oximega Greens adds a minty flavor to any protein shake, much like adding a dash of peppermint extract. This is heavenly in comparison to the freshly-mulched-grass taste that you find in other, similar products\n",
      "I bought 2 bottle of OxiMega and I don't regret. The tastes pretty well, some sweet and I feel a lot of herb there. I usually take it with breakfast, just mix it in glass of water. I can say that I feel my self much better than before: muscle not so painful after exercise and I feel more tone during a day. I also take Orange vitamins together with it, but before I sometimes have been felt sleepy in office. I believe OxiMega is good antioxidant, and it remove from body toxic matter.\n",
      "\n",
      " The only downfall is the taste but this goes for EVERY GREENS. I have yet to try a greens supplement that didn't have that disgusting greens taste. The spearmint is extremely present but I just plug my nose and slam it back. Only tastes 5 seconds and now I have 4-5 servings of fruits and vegetables. I personally won't be switching as the price point is far too good to try something else.\n",
      "The texture (when not fully dissolved) and flavor reminds me of taking Metamucil. Unlike Oximega Greens, mixability is not great. I found that I had to add a lot more water for the scoop to fully dissolve, which ended up diluting the flavor even more. The scoop that comes in the 300 gram container is tiny, and proves to be a hassle when trying to scoop out the bottom of the container. The profile of Oximega Reds looks great and I appreciate that it is natural. Suffice to say, this was a one-time buy for me. I really admire Controlled Labs as a company and think they produce good products, but Oximega Reds needs some tweaking, or at least, transformed into taking capsules instead of mixing powder.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: I never ended up finishing the container of reds that I originally bought, but I recently purchased some OxiMega Greens and decided to combine the two together. It mixes together well and the spearmint + natural orange is strangely not bad, so it's easier to drink. Definitely feel the energy boost after drinking both. Updated rating to 9/10 but taste...eh. \n",
      "Obviously this is an orange flavored drink, but it is an artificial orange, so take that into account when purchasing. In my opinion, the orange flavor tastes exactly like orange Kool-Aid. However, this is complimented by subtle undertones of kiwi and berry. I was able to get three of these, in the 10 serving size, when buying my Oximega Greens during a promotion. I would not have purchased these otherwise. I half expected to be giving these away or tossing them to be honest. However, I'm glad this promotion happened! I love this stuff just almost as much as the greens! Controlled Labs Quality!\n",
      "I mix it with vanilla protein and it tastes good. Excellent product. Works and super convenient.\n",
      "Tastes horrible.  \n",
      "I was skeptical at first when buying this product. After one month of using this product though I noticed increased general energy. After taking it I did not feel as tired at times. \n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor in my opinion is delicious. You need to swish or stir it every couple sips because it settles quickly. Some of it just does not dissolve and gets suspended in the liquid in two different sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I'm happy with the completeness of this product. It goes far beyond a multivitamin/mineral supplement. Also, the price is reasonable.\n",
      "I rarely give 10's, but this product is top of the line. I keep coming back!\n",
      "I've been a loyal OT user for the past 3 years and this is the first time I bought the powdered multi with the Omega Mix complex. I love the powdered form and am hooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before, when I would by the pills and the omega complex separately I would usually forget to drink the omega mix. This eliminates that problem and you even get a boost of energy now from the omega blend. Best multi hands down, especially now that it's blended with the omega complex...not sure if there is even a multi anywhere near as good.\n",
      "The ingredients speak for themselves. No other multi can match OT's and I love that it is in powder form. People need to stop buying products for taste. Yes, it does not taste like candy, but the health benefits are worth it and it is not filled with artificial crap to make it taste good. If you want to buy products for the health benefits then this is the multi for you.\n",
      "This is my first review on bodybuilding.com. I'll start this off with the taste its good but not bad but not the best I like to mix it with other drinks to make it taste better. for the overall I give it a 10 because it really dose work it gives you that boost in the morning and after my workout i take it again and wow it really wakes you're body up from a long workout, I can't live without it now and its the best multivitamin you can buy.\n",
      "Orange Triad has been a staple for years now, tried the Greens a while back and the taste just didn't do it for me. Fast forward to when CL put out a Triad+Greens combo and I must admit, I was a little unsure of how that would work out. Couldn't be more pleased with this, as you get a full-dosage of the Multi and Greens products in powder that doesn't taste half bad. For users who don't like it in water ( I do, personally), mixing it with orange juice or vanilla protein will improve the flavor quite a bit. Have been using this product at night after dinner and the pills in the mornings after breakfast with great results. One of my favorite products on the market\n",
      "Great vitamins but the worst taste! It didn't really have any orange flavor. It tasted like warm grainy vitamins with a bitter light Tang flavor. After about 5 days it just wasn't bearable. \n",
      "If I could take only one supplement, this would probably be it.  You've got a very good multi-vitamin/mineral, a joint complex, greens and reds, and probiotics!  The nutrition facts label speaks for itself.  I mix 1 scoop with my protein shake twice a day and the taste is good too.  Nothing bad I could say about it at all.  The price is pretty good to considering everything you're getting.  If you bought a separate multi, joint complex and greens supplement you would probably end up spending more.\n",
      "Not much to say this product literally has everything you could want from a health related supplement. I especially like the joint complex, definitely saves money in the long run getting all these products in one. The only thing I should note is that it does NOT taste good at all lol. It's not bad if you mix it with fruit punch but in water it's tolerable at best. Still worth it though.\n",
      "My favorite mutlivitamins.\n",
      "Honestly I really dig the flavour. It tastes like orange and greens. I love the taste of natural/greens. If you mix it with orange juice, it tastes even better.\n",
      "I felt a great energy boost after just a couple days of taking it. It wasn't hard to manage having the two drinks every day. I highly recommend it if it's in your budget. I much preferred drinking this vitamin over the pill version of Orange Triad which I liked too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I admit it, I am a supplement junkie. But I don't write many reviews. But I had to on this one. This is the first time I can say that I truly feel this vitamin sup making a difference. After about a week of taking this daily I noticed a little more energy my digestion was better and I don't feel as bloated after a carb heavy meal. \n",
      "I'm not saying it will make you Mr./MS Olympia but I can tell a difference in my day to day life. \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is not great - something like orange tea but only a little bit. It's nothing to brag about but it is bearable. \n",
      "I was interested in this product simply because I am tired of taking a variety of multi-vitamins in pill form.  The profile of this product is outstanding.  The Digestion/Immune complex and the Probiotic complex have made a significant difference in the way my stomach and intestines feel throughout the day. I have contributed its use to much better bowel movements and far less bloating throughout the day. I also have noticed a better sustained energy level without having to consume caffeine. I will continue to use this product as I am a firm believer in its' effectiveness.\n",
      "The cons: tastes horrible when mixed with water.  Compare it to brushing your teeth and immediately drinking tart orange juice. I have found that 8 ozs of low sugar apple juice makes the taste decent.\n",
      "\n",
      "just think its au some that their making vitamins in powder form hope other company's jump on board taste is good in my opinion great product\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been taking the Orange Triad pills for over a year. I went to re-order and saw this. Figured I would give it a try. The taste is somewhat bland, and has a gritty texture. When I first got the pills I was taking 3 at a time, 2 times per day. I would notice that I had \"neon\" pee after each time I would take them. I started taking them 2 at a time 3x a day, and the \"neon\" pee stopped. I also noticed that after starting the pills 2 at a time, I felt better overall. Anecdotally, this indicated that I was just peeing away supps with the larger dosage. The same thing goes for this powder, but it is much harder to break up 1 scoop twice a day into .666 scoops 3 times a day. After this tub is gone, I'm switching back to the pills.\n",
      "I personally think it taste great. I've seen others comment on how they can't take taste. As for how well the product works; a bit hard to review that since it's a vitamin. However, before using this or just orange triad I had knee problems from after long cardio, since I started using this there has not been any knee problems.\n",
      "Chocolate mixed with some Peanut butter or PB2 makes it very similar to a nutty bar which use to be my go to snack. The vanilla was delicious on its own definitely worth a constant re order and suggest them to anyone that is looking for a sweet tooth fix.\n",
      "These are the best protein wafers out there ,  I don't think I would ever order anything else, me and my boyfriend are hiding them from each other , that's how much we love them .... Tumbs up !!!!\n",
      "This was a delightful protein snack. The crispness was fantastic and the flavor was without the usual protein-y weirdness common with a lot of proteins.\n",
      "Love them!!  I am a Chocolate addict, but believe it or not I keep re-ordering the Vanilla!\n",
      "so great......you have to teste that for real !!!!!\n",
      "Yum!!! I had the Wheyfer with nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt and fresh strawberries and it was absolutely amazing! My favorite!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product if your a bodybuilder or just want to see your veins pop.  If your a powerlifter or strength athelete (Like myself) this product will do nothing for you.  However, when i take the product as the powerlifter i am, i do notice my viens bulging like never before.  Great product!\n",
      "tried this product and had zero effect. In my workouts I could not improve my sets or reps even for 1 rep - doing exactly same routine eating same etc. I tried either with food or without food 1H before workout without food and 2 1/2H before workout with food no difference either.  Needless to say there was also zero pump effect. So as i see this was complete waste of money. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product! I use agmatine every day and have tried all the brands... this is by far the best the energy is amazing and the pump also! \n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff worked pretty good for me. I was taking this for a month and lost 12 lbs in 3 weeks. It didnt give me jitters or upset my stomach. It may not work for everyone, but i would definitely recommend this.\n",
      "I have been trying to lose weight for quite a while with little success. I have someone who is giving me help in this matter and it was s****ested that I use a thermogenic powder to increase my metabolism during the day. I bought several different brands to see what one I would like best and so far this has beaten the others I have tried hands down. I take a full dose first thing in the morning and then 1/2 of a dose every 3 hours or so until about 6pm or so. I'm not all jittery and stuff at all but maintain a constant level or so it feels. It doesn't mix the best and you have to swirl the last gulp to get everything. It doesn't taste bad but I usually take it with a BCAA powder. I lost the most weight with this product - it works!\n",
      "Taste amazing. Helping me get shredded and train for physical fitness tests. Warning it you do get a lot of sinkers in it.\n",
      "I can't tell if this thermogenic works at all. I don't feel any different taking the two scoops in the morning and the second in the afternoon. I'm on my second tub, I'll try the 8 weeks on and then the rest period and see if I notice a difference in body fat loss. This **** doesn't mix at all. I've tried mixing with a fork, blender bottle, and even a blender and it never goes into solution. It's so grainy it's like drinking sand, it's pretty hard to choke down. As for the flavor, I drink 5+ cups of green tea a day, I was pretty excited for the flavor... but it's awful. It's one of the worst things I've ever tasted. It really makes me thing CORE didn't test this stuff at all before putting it out. I use their other products and love them\n",
      " Now it is part of my daily routine .\n",
      "I have been using Core ISO about a month now and really like it. There is not a ton of additional ingredients and it tastes good. Being an ISO is does not upset my stomach in the slightest which is huge for me given I consume so much of the stuff!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is by far the best post workout I have ever used. The chocolate taste is awesome and it mixes well. It helped me get leaner and build more muscle. I love it and I would highly recommend it.\n",
      "Great tasting and made from 100% of the highest quality whey you can get.  Core Nutritionals does not compromise their products with fillers or spiking with loose aminos.  This is a purpose built protein for fast absorption, post workout.\n",
      "Great taste, mixes well and not overly sweet, no protein stomach bloat either\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this protein powder mixes well and taste Great!!!   \n",
      "Good profile for the price. And the Peanut Butter Ice Cream tastes like melted Ben and Jerry's.\n",
      "Ok taste.  Not as sweet as I was expecting but a decent mix.  Bought because my wife likes this brand and her new gym has recipes that uses this to account for macros.  Getting the vanilla flavor next so hope it is at least as good as chocolate.\n",
      "Absolutely in love with this product and flavour !! You simply can not beat the taste / overall performance of this product\n",
      "Add it to your cart now:)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I started taking this product after reading into how it effects power output and protien synthesis.  Being a World Class Powerlifter in the 105kg weight class its very important for me.  As i started taking the product i noticed that i felt a little stronger.  Whether its the hmb or my mind feeling stronger i cant really verify but it is a good product as far as HMB is concerned.  Very clean and unflavored.\n",
      "very clean product. great value for money. Mixes pretty well. a little bit sinks to the bottom. But there was no scooper. Not sure if it was suppose to come with one or not.   \n",
      "Did not care for this product. I did not see any results. I did take it as directed.\n",
      "At the moment they are very good, I bought it for my wife, she is using. It is just beginning the cycle.\n",
      "cinnamon is good flavor, used it as a substitute for my cellucor cinnamon flavor in my oatmeal. 100% would not recommend fruity pebbles, awful but cinnamon is really good\n",
      "This protein powder is INSANE.  You cannot taste a bit of protein in this powder and it is by far my favorite.  The only reason I gave this product a 9 is that isn't necessarily spot on CTC. STILL AMAZING TASTE.\n",
      "I use this protein at work when I don't have time for a full meal, the taste is spot on to fruity pebbles, my only complaint would be it leaves little chunks when mixing with a spoon but in a blender bottle it blends perfectly, I highly recommend this if you are big on taste.\n",
      "This is absolutely without fail the most delicious tasting protein I have ever had. Fruity Pebbles  is my favorite cereal, and I have to say that they absolutely nailed the flavor. I recommend mixing it with milk to give this protein a thicker body. If you do that, it literally taste like the delicious flavor of the milk afterwards - if water is all you have, it does taste great still because that's how I started drinking it, but once you try it with milk you will never return. As far as effectiveness goes I am definitely getting some gains while using this protein!\n",
      "I have too many protein, but this one has the worst taste ever in my whole entire life which is fruity cereal crunch. I mixed it with cold water and it tastes like a children liquid medicine for coughing. I do not know why all these high reviews.\n",
      "The taste is amazing, once i had the first scoop it surprised me because of how similar it was to the cereal. I have to say though for me after a while I just get tired of it. It's like eating a bowl of cereal everyday \n",
      "This is my favorite tasting protein. \n",
      "I love this protein! I ordered the fruity cereal flavor and OMG! it soooo tastes like fruity pebbles. I was a little worried about buying it and being disappointed but trust me you will love it. It is a very thin powder and mixes easily with water and yogurt. I love it! \n",
      "this has a great flavor and is easily mixable- i gotta say though when i was searching and came across this i was looking for real cereal. It came in a box, and i had a moment where i thought this was protein cereal. Saddened when i opened a box of powder, but the amazing taste and profile made up for my momentary disappointment.\n",
      "This stuff is amazingly genius - I love my little kid cereals and the flavoring on this does not disappoint at all! It's everything I had hoped and even better than I had expected.  Mixed with water it takes just like the milk at the end of a big bowl of fruity pebbles.  I also started mixing a little in with my morning oats for a sweetener and the oat texture makes it taste just like the cereal.  The nutritional profile is on point too - can't wait to try the cinnamon toast crunch and cocoa puff flavors next.\n",
      "Just got this protein and gotta say it did taste like cinnamon toast crunch to me very good. \n",
      "At the moment they are very good, I bought it for my wife, she is using. It is just beginning the cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have used many different N.O. products, and this one seems to work very well. It seems to have a much better affect when taken on an empty stomach then right after a meal. I found it to work best if taken 45 min- hour pre workout instead of the listed 30 min prior. I used 3 pills 45min-1 hour pre workout everyday and got great skin ripping pumps day in and out. The only downside I found was that when taken too close with food it did not work near as well. Good overall product, and I will be buying again.\n",
      "I've always been a no2 black fan (the original), but wanted to give another no booster a shot. I came across this n.o. nitro and thought I'd give it a try. I'm about finished with my first bottle and it made my veins pop from the first dose. I take it with my pw, warm up, and I'm off! I would give it a 9 if it was a little more detailed of the ingredients. Keep in mind that this has to be cycled so you have to keep track how long you're on it. Most no boosters take a few weeks to get results but this was almost immediately. If you like the original no2 black like me, try this and you'll be impressed. Less pills and faster results. \n",
      "Good energy from this product. Not skin tingling, but effective. Flavor was good and mixed well with water not leaving clumps or chalky leftovers.  I took N.O. Nitro with it as well 45 min-1 hour pre workout. I generally took this later in the day, and had no trouble falling asleep at night after taking it around this time frame. I will be purchasing this product again.\n",
      "I have been using this product for almost a year. I feel it gives me a lean vascular pump. I would definitely recommend it. I stack it with carbon by lane.  \n",

      "\n",
      "As a recommendation from a friend from bodyspace I decided to give this product a try. At first I didnt notice too much of a change but once I started taking this product for a while I began to have more energy during my workouts as well as more vascularity. If someone is looking for a good preworkout they should absolutely give Noxivol a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really a great product! \n",
      "I Read The Reviews And I Just Neglected Them, But They Were Right. This Was By Far The Most Disgusting Poor Excuse For A Mass Gainer I've Ever Tried. I Just Thought With So Much Respect In The Bodybuilding World Jay Cutler Would Put Out Something Worthy. Disappointed Customer.\n",
      "I really like this stuff, It helped me put on size and not fat. The flavor is really good,\n",
      "This is a great Weight Gainer i use it when i am on my creatine cycle the taste is really good i think this the 2 best on the market !!!\n",
      "The reviews that rave about the taste must be fake. This is one of the worst tasting supplements I have ever tried. I returned it for a refund.\n",
      "This is by far, without the doubt, the stickiest weight gainer I've used.  It also finds a way to get all over your floor and counter/table.  That being said, Vanilla Cookie is delicious and I will definitely buy this again if it's on sale, it's a little pricey for the regular price.\n",
      "it taste good. rebuilds your muscle. goes down smooth, no bad effects.\n",
      "This is by far my favorite mass gainer. It has been in my diet every time I've been on a bulk. The taste is amazing, especially with a low fat milk, and also in a matter of 3 months I had approximately gained 23 pounds of muscle and my claim to fame was due to this product! Recommended to anyone looking to make some serious gains!\n",
      "I have no clue where the other reviews came from but I love this product, and I thought of many reasons not to try this lineup. It is one of the easiest mixing mass gainers I have ever had, and over 35 years in the sport I've had them all. I don't mind the taste, it was easy on the stomach, no bloating, and alongside MHP I think it's one of the top 2, at least for me.\n",
      "I only ever tried the vanilla. But the taste is really bad, Idk if it's just me but at first it was sweet than it tasted strong vanilla. I always drink it after a workout. I chug it down from the time I leave the locker room and by the time I reach the front door it's gone. This might help some of other people. But as far as the results I'll honestly say that it works. I tried everything form russian bear 5000 to Opinmum Preformace. And this is the best one. I'm not just saying this to get something. As I stated before, I'm just being totally honest.\n",
      "A good product will come to buy love\n",
      "This test booster is amazing. My strength is through the roof and I'm putting on mass like crazy. One of the better test products I've tried. No side effects, no mood swings just results. Great product. \n",
      "I've been ordering from this site for several years now and I have to admit, this was one of the most disappointing orders I've ever made. I used this along with Dry, and in the end, saw barely any differences :( Well, that's me being nice, I honestly didn't see any difference, probably should be rating this as a 1. I went back into my old habit of swimming and exercising more while working out hard at the gym and got a tiny bit slimmer and gained \"okay\" size compared to my previous routines. I think it was all from the exercise and muscle milk though, which I'm used to using and seeing the differences from. As for the other health it's supposed to provide, nope.\n",
      "Honestly no clue if this actually works or not.  It may be my training because I have really been training hard and I am seeing some PRs but there is no real evidence that a Testosterone booster helps.  I would say it might provide a placebo effect so that would help even if the product doesn't.\n",
      "I purchased  Dry and Big T from Cutler Nutrition and both came with only 27 capsules, not 28 as they say. This is a false advertising, not given what I payed for! \n",
      "I don't know what all the other guys are seeing in this product but it doesn't do anything I've taken the whole bottle and no new results. I've taken other test boosters and only one that they don't sell anymore worked. I thought I would try this product to get a little more cut and get over the plateau I hit from dieting and nothing. I want try test boosters again cause there are no real study's to back them up just reviews from people who think it works.  \n",
      "If you are like me, you are taking this supplement mainly for the phosphatidic acid content. The label does not clearly identify the exact amounts within the contents of one serving, but my estimate would be roughly 500-750mg per serving. The results I got from taking this supplement were exactly as described. I could feel my strength increase week to week, and this supplement combined with creatine greatly reduced my recovery time. King is a great product for anyone seeking to gain mass and strength, although cheaper sources of phosphatidic acid are available. As a muscle building supplement, King manages to be one step ahead of most of the other similar products available on the market today. \n",
      "The old formula contained properly-dosed, patented, MediaTOR Phosphatidic Acid. I got the results you'd expect - a small but perhaps noticeable increase in LBM, better pumps, increase in appetite and better endurance. Again, small differences, but still noticeable. It was a go-to supplement when bulking.\n",
      "\n",
      "At some point the formula was changed to a proprietary blend containing BPI's \"ActivaTOR\" Phosphatidic Acid in a proprietary blend half the dosage of the original. This could possibly be placebo, but this supplement now does effectively nothing but make your wallet lose weight. Ran two bottles with zero results.\n",
      "Definetely way better product than Test Freak!Just not sure if the stomachache came up from this product!\n",
      "I THINK I GOT AN OVERDUE PRODUCT CAUSE THE PILLS DIDNT LOOK RIGHT. IT MADE MY SH*T TURN GREEN FOR SOME REASON. I DID NOT FELT ANY CHANGES.\n",
      "Total waste of money. Softened me out, no change in strength at all...some bloating, and water retention. Terrible supplement. Not sure what all of these reviews are talking about honestly. Just another BS voodoo supplement full of false promises. \n",
      "I tried CN King without really finding any reviews on it. I wanted to isolate this product for an accurate assessment, so I only took King and creatine. \n",
      "After 1 month......hell after 1 week, I noticed an increase in strength, which is kinda what the product promises. \n",
      "Now I'm gonna stack it with CN Living Large package and see what happens. Fingers crossed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly recommend this product. \n",
      "The Cutler Nutrition KING is an awesome product for anybody looking for a super boost in strength, also I have had noticeable gains in lean muscle mass as well! This product can and will deliver everything the bottle says it will, just try it and see if I'm lying! ;-)\n",
      "serving size is 3 caps but the directions recommend 2 per day. are you guys doing 3 or 2 and how have the results been?\n",
      "I enjoyed this and love stacking it with other items \n",
      "I believe it has helped with overall strength gains\n",
      "Noticed some gains but felt under dosed compared to other PA products I have taken\n",
      "Definitely saw strength gains with this product. Haven't seen too much muscle gains yet but I'm only half way through. Definite strength gains!\n",
      "Good flavor, the mixing was ok but it has too much sugar in my opinion.\n",
      "I got it in a 2x1 sale so it was good.\n",
      "I got this as a BOGO, won't purchase again.  It was good for the price, seems like a solid product.  Didn't like the taste, felt sorta chemically.\n",
      "Bought this protein as a BOGO and I couldn't be happier with the purchase. The protein is smooth, tastes great, and never upsets my very sensitive stomach. Mix the Cookies and Cream flavor with some milk and it literally tastes like a yummy diner milkshake. Great product! Without the BOGO it is a little expensive but if you want some good quality protein, this is something you should buy!\n",
      "All products of Cutler work pretty good!I use \"Legend\" and \"King\" to!This particular isolate taste better than everything else i have tried before!\n",
      "Bought this from the B1G1 free sale a few days ago and having had the total protein from cutler nutrition, this didn't disappoint. Obviously thinner consistency since it's an isolate but still very good.\n",
      "Good supplements , Good value\n",
      "This is a great product that mixes easy and has a great taste. \n",
      "im big fan of jay cutler but im sorry to say that this product taste of choclate fudge brownie really bad taste im not gona buy again . sorry jay \n",
      "\n",
      "great design .. and seriously I have not experienced any leaking and I use it at least twice a day! I suspect users reporting leaking because the top and the \"cyclone mixing thingy\" they are not aligned properly? It is pricey but it is a great shaker!\n",
      "Not a very good shaker at all. Certainly not worth the price. Constantly leaks no matter how tight the lid is on, i seriously regret buying this. The cyclone works well for mixing creatine etc and the storage space is useful, but i would just buy a cheaper shaker that doesnt leak constantly\n",
      "I like the cup it mixes well only downsides are the lid can get a little stiff and i wish the storage was multiple compartment and had lids like the blender bottle. Also it would be nice if there were a variety of sizes.\n",
      "This shaker is good. I just wish it came in a 20 oz size. You will have to put some force into the tab when closing it or it will leak but when it's closed its really closed. \n",
      "There reasons why I gave it 2 it's only because I like the protein compartment and the design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that this product leaks! There's nothing worse than a leaking shaker bottle. The cap is also very hard to open once closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the price, I expected a better quality produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a positive, bodybuilding.com was kind enough to refund this after reporting the leakage.\n",
      "The cyclone cup looks great and promises a lot of things like a good seal, not having a odor. But I bought two of theses cups and they leak and have a smell. It looks great but leaked in my gym bag to many times.\n",
      "Great cup that doesn't leak. If you are using quality supplements there should be no issues with how well it mixes. Cup doesn't stink after using it and to sum it up... Yes I would buy the Cyclone again.\n",
      "I LOVE this bottle! From time to time it will leak a bit but if you ***** it tight enough it'll stay dry. The next best thing to the Umoro Bottle :) \n",
      "Definitely one of the worst shakers I've purchased. Only two reasons I didn't give it just one star ... the powder compartment below the cup and the look of the cup. Other than that, this is a horrible design. Even after a cycle in the dishwasher, it will still come out smelling like sour milk. There are too many crevices that are hard to reach when you are cleaning it by hand and there's always leftover protein drink that is hard to see which, hours later, equals ... stench from hell. If you have any more than about 8 oz of liquid + protein powder, it's hard to ***** on because the \"cyclone\" mixer presses down against the protein and any other solids you may have added (ice, fruit, etc). Unless you are willing to pressure wash this thing within 2 minutes after every use, stay away from this cup. \n",
      "Bought this cause wanted a great bottle with a compartment in the bottom. Looks better online, but once you get it you'll  see with the compartment added its too large. For those of you wondering if it leaks, YES IT DOES and TOO MUCH !!!  Protein also gets stuck easily inside.  Think its just my bottle??? No i bought one for me & one for my wife, hers has all of the same problems. Bottom line DON'T PURCHASE THIS BOTTLE!! \n",
      "This shaker cup was great, at first, Looks good and works well, but it's kind of a hassel to clean. After a few months i decided to go back to my old ball-shaker. I felt it was a lot more practical. based on my experience, i would reccomend this shaker bottle, but I'm probably never gonna buy it again.\n",
      "This is the best shaker out there PERIOD!  Perfect size, I love the extra compartment, and looks awesome!  I've used other shakers just like everyone else and this Cyclone Cup os better in that it does not stink after multiple uses.  No more clumpy protein, no more leaks.  I even use it to shake up my scrambled eggs in the morning!\n",
      "The first thing I noticed about this product is it is hefty!  It's made of a nice, quality, hard plastic.  I like that it doesn't feel flimsy in my hand, or that it will shatter if I happen to drop it, which has happened by the way.  However, I do feel that this cup has more cons than pros.  The shaker is hard to clean, it doesn't mix protein powder well.  It gets clumpy.  It works well for my pre/post drinks because those powders are finer.  It drips, all the time, on my shirt while drinking, and while shaking.  The clasp is really tight, which isn't a bad thing, but it does make it tricky if you are trying to open it with one hand.  It doesn't stop me from using it everyday, I just thought I would offer up an honest review.\n",
      "initially worked well. however have to tear apart to clean well and then never goes back together well enough so leaks. large. don't recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incredibly horrible cup... I bought this due to all the great reviews. But it leaks like a faucet. Despite making sure all the seals were clean and dry and tightening the cap and top completely, I've had multiple episodes of this cup spray it's contents all over me and the floor. This is the worst shaker cup I have... hands down.\n",
      "I use this mixer everyday of the week. I like it because I can put my protein in the cup and an extra scoop in the storage cup and take it to work. It closes tightly and doesn't spill all over the place. It's sturdy and washes well in the dishwasher without any issues.  \n",
      "Bought 2. Cup is great and container on the bottom is awesome for extra protein, vitamins, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixer could mix a little better. Overall not bad!\n",
      "Shaker works well and works without leaks.\n",
      "Could do without the bottom container half though, would definitely benefit from the extra liquid space.\n",
      "I have used many shakers but this one is the best and the cyclone design for mixing is excellent and well thought. I am actually using a protein that has chocolate chips in it and other shakers filter it out and I am unable to get them but not with this one, this mixes everything well and delivers the enter thing to me and it is very smooth.\n",
      "A bit disappointed in this product because it constantly leaks. I got it for work for my BCAA and they no doubt get all over me every time I drink them. I would rate it a 9 if it didn't leak I really like the shaker overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "This product was decent at best. I would not recommend for protein powder drinks, however, I would recommend for other sorts of supps like creatine, bcaa's, pre workouts, etc... The shaker isn't easy to clean and gets funky very quickly. It is not very large at all so everything that I drank from it was very saturated. \n",
      "Favorite shaker so far. Everything except the spout cover comes apart for easy cleaning. The bottom storage is big enough for a scoop and a half of protein. I have even dropped it several times and only have a small dent on bottom.\n",
      "Would not s****est cleaning in the dishwasher. Did once and the rubber seal took a day to fit right again. \n",
      "Just as many others have said - This shaker mixes well, but leaks. A friend bought the same shaker and his leaked as well. \n",
      "I love this shaker for its design and functionality, its also well built. I haven't had any leaking and lid being too tight problems like the other reviewers have mentioned, the bottle seals up very well. I highly recommend this shaker bottle.\n",
      "constantly leaks   and the powder in the storage compartment turns into a mess because of the condensation    other similar bottles work much better for cheaper\n",
      "Mixes protein well; would be nicer if it could hold more liquid.\n",
      "I have used Blendr Bottles forever and will never go back. This mixes better the additional storage is a huge plus. I prep everything the night before for the next day and I am good to go with everything I need. Easy to clean and maintain.\n",
      "Great shaker cup. Mixes well with no lumps. Bottom holds two portions of powder, so it lasts me all day when I'm away from home.\n",
      "Great colors, I have 3 of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this shaker. Not only does it mix up protein and pre-workout better it also looks really good. And another good thing is that it is quiet no more hearing the clinging of a blender bottle with a whisk ball. \n",
      "Great shaker cup. Doesn't leak, sturdy, great colors, and easy to clean. Only thing stopping me from giving it a 10 is that I wish it could hold up to 20oz.\n",
      "Before i bought one, my first thought was it look a little expensive for a shaker cup. Decided I wanted one anyways (i think it actually was what pushed me over a goal for the free gift lol). This product is amazing. really strong plastic, well made, doesn't leak even a little, the design of the mixing element works amazingly well. Highly recommend this.\n",
      "\n",
      "This cup is awesome. Works way better than any other shaker bottle /i have owned. The storage compartment is great for postworkout supps. The color choices are nice. I bought two that were my school colors, then swapped them so that both bottles have two different colors.  My only complaints are little ones. The bottle is a little small. Its really only good for mixing supps, doesn't make a good water bottle, It is leak proof, however, if you get water or something around the ring of the lid or cup, it will then spill out when you shake and make you think the cup is leaking. Great cup though! If youre looking for something other than the traditional blender bottle to get the job done, get one of these!\n",
      "I have been using my Cyclone Cup for a little over a week now. I AM SOLD. It was recommended by a great friend of mine from the gym and I have never been happier with a shaker cup. NO CLUMPS, NO LEAKS. I have had 3 people already ask me about the cup at the gym and where they can get them. I might even buy one for my girlfriend! Would Recommend 10/10!\n",
      "I have never used any other shaker cup and i won't after using the cyclone cup. It mixes extremely well with no clumps at all and is very durable. I am in the Navy and have to workout on my ship everyday and it has fallen onto the deck more times than i can count and doesn't have a single crack in it. I don't have any problem with it leaking either.\n",
      "It does NOT leak as some people said (I was not going to buy it cause of them, but ended up buying it cause I liked the light blue color lol...)\n",
      " \n",
      "It is TRUE that when you close the lid, it's hard to reopen...\n",
      "But it has to be like that otherwise it would leak lol ...\n",
      "The compartment on the bottom is perfect. Size is good, easy to wash.\n",
      "Best shaker ever :) I DO NOT regret buying it :P\n",
      "This is a very good shaker. It does not leak and the lid is easy to drink out of. The storage on the bottom is very convenient. The only drawback I have discovered is you have to tighten the top and the bottom on very tight, otherwise it will leak...and I mean tight to the point where its a little hard to unscrew. I actually dropped mine in the gym my first day using it and the cap didn't open and nothing leaked out. Great shaker overall. Ill be buying more of these soon. \n",
      "I don't think I'll ever want to buy this again. Leakage comes out of the side when you shake it, the bottle has scratches and when you tighten the lid, man is it hard to reopen. The bottle looks awesome and everything but it's just not worth it. When you put powder underneath it crunches when you close it back up. I would rather get a bottle that shakes better, doesn't leak. \n",
      "I love this shaker cup. its sturdy and doesn't leak when in my workout bag! I love it so much I bought one for my husband as well!\n",
      "I bought 6 of these for myself and my family and we love them. Made of sturdy materials, they come apart easily for cleaning in the dishwasher without degradation to the seal it forms when put back together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unique mixing component does a fantastic job of mixing all our pre, intra and post workout shakes where others I've used have a tougher time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: Mixes well; sturdy construction; bottom cap for storage\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: Not a con really but more of a wish-list item.... Perhaps the next line could provide a larger capacity cup with two containers on the bottom for extra powders or supplements.\n",
      "Coolest looking shaker out there..and never leaves a clump\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product, while it works better than the traditional whisk ball; i was hoping for taller cup. otherwise its a great product.\n",
      "Great Cup!  I especially like that the bottom screws off so I can keep more product in there for a second serving.\n",
      "My first cyclone cup had a slight malfunction that wouldn't allow the lid to properly seal. This problem was fixed by a Cyclone Cup rep who took the initiative to reach out to its customer and ensure them that I had a cup from a bad batch of seals. In return, I now have fully functional cups that I haven't had a problem with whatsoever!\n",
      "The looks and feel of the cups are great! Very sturdy main compartment, wide mouth port, and sturdy attached mixer. I'm not a fan of the small metal spiral/ball bouncing around in ordinary shakers once my drink if finished, so the fixed mixer in the Cyclone cup is a plus. Also, upon cleaning the entire cup, the mixer can be taken out and washed and dried after use, so as to not leave a bad smell. The bottom removable compartment allows me to store post-workout supplements for quick access after my workout (roughly two \"normal\" scoops allowable room). \n",
      "The absolute only reason that my rating is a 9/10 is that the Cyclone Cup is just a tad bit too wide, and top heavy for my car's cup holder...but beggars can't be choosers. Once I've already filled it with protein & water, I would hate to even take the chance of laying it in the seat beside me and have it spill everywhere if the lid were to get snagged open. \n",
      "As long as these cups continue to do their job functionality wise, I don't see myself using chintzy shaker cups anymore!\n",
      "I bought 2 of these (one for me one for wife). Both leak badly from the top. There is no seal for the top of the cup. It leaks coming down from the lid. This is to say it leaks without being completely full. Say it is half full and you drink from it so you invert the cup. Well when you put it down the liquid drips down from the lid and comes through the top. This results in puddles wherever i bring it. When I am at the gym there is a constant water puddle lining the bottom of the cup wherever I put it down. Really dissapointed, especially given the price. On the plus side it does seem to mix well, so there is that (this is why I am not rating it at 1). \n",
      "Great shaker cup, I trully believe it's the best on the market. No spills whatsoever mixes great and is very durable overall. Oh and no odor is left behind even after washing it hours after i've used it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't use it because I can't even get the lid off to wash it prior to the first use. Waste of money.\n",
      "After the company send me replace. this is the best shaker. no leak. looks great.\n",
      "Thanks to VP Brad Meyer for his best service.\n",
      "I really enjoy this cup and it blends very well.  I have not had an issue with it leaking yet but my only complaint is that it does tend to get powder stuck in the edges that don't want to mix.\n",
      "I love this cup! It gets out the worst clumps and there is never an odor. I wanted to test this out so I left it dirty for a few days, cleaned it, and it was like new.  My only complaints are that it is a little small. I have to do two scoops of mass gainer with 16 oz of milk and this cup wont fit all of that so I have to make two different drinks. Also the cup on the bottom leaves a lot of powder stuck to it instead of emptying completely.  Other than that I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: After using this cup for a few months now I have learned that it does not seal very well and leaks A LOT.  It's not that big of a deal but it is extremely frustrating that I no longer use this cup.\n",
      "Worked well at first, but then started to leak after about a few day of use. Not worth it in my opinion. is not good to use with protine powder after shake the powder will stuck a big chuck at the lid and is hard to clean and the bottle is over price\n",
      "\n",
      "Worked well at first, but then started to leak after about a month of use. Not worth it in my opinion. \n",
      "So far using this shaker for for a couple weeks haven't had any issues. It does feel a bit cheap but I do like having a larger compartment for a supplement at the bottom of the shaker.\n",
      "If any improvements maybe making the bottom and top a stronger material since more than likely most ppl will have this with them in the gym around work out equipment.\n",
      "I was disappointed with this shaker.  I bought 2 of them from Bodybuilding.com last month. The colored plastic (top and bottom) look and feel cheap. It does not look like the images on the site. Also, the cups both leak, not from the nozzle, but from where the top screws onto the main body. It won't leak if I ***** the top on tightly with all my strength but then I can't open it again without running it under hot water for about 30 seconds. \n",
      "This is the comment I left when I first purchased this product. It leaked but after the company contacted me and sent me a replacement. Now that it doesn't leak I love this cup and no other cup would compare. I love the colors and the design especially how the company cares about the satisfaction of there customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It started leaking for the price not worth my cup leaking all over me while I'm trying to work out.\n",
      "First i really loved the look of the shaker cup . But when i used it i loved the whole idea of it . It work super good and does everything it says will be ordering my SECOND cup soon ! :) and the cup doesn't leak if you no how to put it on right haha. don't listen to the reviews its a very tight sealed up.  \n",
      "I love it but I cannot call it excellent because it leaks while I shake it.  I didnt expect it to do so.  I love that it is convenient and I have space to store my protein on the bottom.  I love the color because it is a vivid pink.  \n",
      "Best shaker I've ever had!! GReat\n",
      "good shaker .\n",
      "\n",
      "I received this about a day ago and so far I am very pleased with this product. We'll see if this lasts the test of time but for now its the best shaker cup I've owned. I was first very hesitant to fork over $17 bucks or whatever it is for just a shaker cup but I'm very glad I did. Right now I'm using Cellucor COR Performance Whey and so far zero clumps and no residue at the bottom of the cup. Stays very clean. There have been zero leaks. What really surprised me is how hard the overall plastic is, I feel like this will last me a long time. I'm on a D1 college crew team and due to the shape and material I was able to put a crew decal on the bottle. It looks quite impressive and looks as if it was apart of the teams gear. The cap forms a very secure fit and I feel like I could keep the bottle full in my bag without it opening. The rubber grips at the top of the cup are really nice. I decided to go with the white one and I've already had some complements on it. \n",
      "The only negative aspect of this bottle is that it can't contain as much liquid as I would like. There really is no way to fix this because the bottle is already large enough. \n",
      "Overall: 9/10 Great investment and the best shaker I've used. I'd definitely recommend.\n",

      "1st try (12oz water 2scoops protein) didnt even mix big chunks everywhere\n",
      "2nd try (12oz water 1 scoop protein) shaked well for a few minutes and still getting small chunks of protein that gives me nauseas.\n",

      "The CycloneCup Mixes Better, itâs more fashionable and you can store your supplements and make your shake later. I would highly recommend buying one if you havenât already!! I suggest Pink:-)\n",

      "As long as you don't fill it to the brim this is the best shaker cup I've ever used. I've bought 2 of them now. One in blue plus one in green and I'll probably buy another. The hard plastic easier to clean and doesn't absorb smells as easily as some softer plastic shakers I've used.\n",
      "\n",
      "My green one came with a little chip, but it's built well enough I didn't bother complaining or trying to get a replacement. I am worried the hard plastic might chip easier, but it's a fair trade for the cleanliness provided by hard, dishwasher safe plastic.\n",
      "Hello everyone!\n",
      "Tried to work with this shaker.\n",
      "Not very much, as the foil inside the shaker, though, and has a modern design, but not very well stirs deep powder, and this is the main task of the shaker!\n",
      "In the future probably will not be ordering this shaker.\n",
      "Good luck to everyone!\n",
      "Yes, it looks pretty cool; however, mine started leaking after only a few months.  Not cool given that I baby it (i.e., never been in dishwasher or thrown around).  Stick with the blender bottle... not as cool looking but it works well.  Also, given that this bottle doesn't have a free-floating mixer, sometimes powder gets stuck on the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "shaker is excellent, the design is innovative and its functionality is great, the protein dissolves very well without lumps, and the best thing is that there are many colors\n",
      "You have to buy this shaker now! You will not regret it! The plastic that it's made out of is amazing, and it looks great! The looks about isn't the only good thing. My protein shakes would always have clumps in it, before using this. When I first bought this shaker, I thought people were just over exaggerating about it, but now I honestly can say that all the good things the people said about this shaker really was true. I make 3-4 shakes with this cup a day, and it has never once been clumpy, and another good thing about this shaker, is that it doesn't smell! The only thing I regret about this shaker cup is... absolutely nothing. Get it!! \n",
      "Great cup!! It really mixes everything. It makes easy to mix even a tougher protein, like Casein.\n",
      "I had problems with my previous shaker cups. My protein shakes were always clumping, but now this problem is solved!\n",
      "I highly recommend this shaker cup to everyone!\n",
      "Best shaker cup on the market to date. I have been using this shaker for over a month now and it blends whatever supplement I put in there. No clumps, no spills, and best of all good design. I would highly recommend this shaker it will not disappoint you like some previous shakers I have had.\n",
      "This was definitely a cool shaker cup. Have not tried mixing a tougher protein such as casein yet but I would say it does just a good a job as a normal shaker cup. The up side is that it looks pretty cool but I wish it was a little bigger. Overall, nothing too exciting. \n",
      "I have used almost every type of shaker cup there is on the market, and have had an issue with my protein shakes clumping and not mixing right. No matter how long or violently I tried to mix my shakes, they STILL clumped! So, in purchasing this cup, I was for sure skeptical without a doubt, but thought I would take a chance on this one because I had heard how good it was. After purchasing, I can honestly say I was impressed with how well it mixes up my protein shakes! You don't have the bad odor from expired protein if you don't clean it right away, and it cleans up really well. I recommend this Cyclone Shaker cup for anybody who wants to get the most out their protein.\n",
      "I've ordered the black version of this cup. The moment I took it out of the box I knew that had I've seen it in the store I would never buy it. I simply don't find it to be that special. There is nothing really that amazing about it and to give the rating of 10 I would expect to be a bit surprised by it.\n",
      "It certainly does its job with having my post workout meals mixed, but so did the cup before it. The price is also comparable, not that competitive at all.\n",
      "This is the best shaker I've  ever used its the next level of shaker cups. I've never had a problem with clumps or spills since the purchase of this item. It really is top notch and if your in the market for a high class, no spill, no leaks,  no clumps then this shaker is for you!\n",
      "Love this cup! I like the storage container with it as well. I have regular shaker cups and this is so much better! No noise when you're mixing!\n",
      "Love it because of the awesome way it's build.\n",
      "LEGIT SHAKER!! Very sturdy, but still plastic so don't drop it. The lid stays closed if tips over, and the rubber edges adds some extravagance to it. You'd think the the plastic \"cyclone\" compartment isn't any better than a whisk, but it makes a huge different. Havent had a chunky protein shake since I got it. The down size is you washing it, but that's with everything. Trust when I say everyone will be 'mirin. \n",
      "An excellent product for those who try to gain some weight. Muscles obtain everything they need with this gainer, unfortunately, you will gain some fat as well. It is ok for skinny guys though.\n",
      "\n",
      "10 I say 10! I've used a lot of stuff, this is by far the best for lean mass gains. True Mass does a better job if you don't mind working off some hot dog action by the belt or if your super skinny (and can't gain whieght). This product is great to grow and stay lean! My vote is in.... If you train, you know your taking it....\n",
      "Decent flavor, but it causes gas for me. I also would prefer more protein per scoop, but this product got the job done.\n",
      "I liked the taste and ability to mix easily. Info says \"554 calories and 54g of protein\". However this is for 4 scoops, not 2 (2 is the serving size). It's almost impossible to have 4 scoops with how big the scooper is so you need to space it out all day. Overall a good product that helped me out on some weight, but wish I got more calories and protein in each serving. \n",
      "Tried this after being recommended by a friend. By far the best weight gainer I've tried, never went back to my old one. Mixes really well, scoop isn't huge and it doesn't leave you feeling bloated or full. Really good amino acid profile as well, for the price you really can't go wrong.\n",
      "Overall great product. It's not super high-calorie as far as gainers go, but good protein/carb content, and this is by far the best product I've tried in terms of recovery. I also like the added creatine during bulking phases. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I rate this 8/10 instead of 10 is that both flavors I've tried have been way too sweet for my taste. Mixed with milk they are far too rich, and even with water they're more of a plug-and-chug kinda protein. As much as I like the results I see with cyto gainer, the flavor nearly kills it for me. The fact that I've ordered cyto more than once is a testament to how well the product works.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First off the taste even in water is amazing best protein I've ever tasted by far, the cookies n cream is just simply amazing. Also compared to other mass gainers this is a lot cheaper per serving ! Great taste and is helping me put on some weight !\n",
      "So I went from using regular whey protein after each workout to Cytosport Gainer a couple weeks ago, and so far I've seen a slight increase in mass and my bench press has went up, which is great! I can tell the product works, and the price isn't too bad either for the amount you get. In each scoop you get carbs, calories, a good protein blend, creatine, and plenty of BCAA's, making this product ideal for gaining mass, yet cheaper than most other mass gainers. I found the taste to be pretty good. I actually look forward to mixing up two scoops after a good workout just because the taste is so good. Its almost like a post workout dessert. Overall great product and I can say that because I've noticed slight results since I started to use this product. You can't go wrong with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a boost to maximize lean muslcle-mass gains during your next bulk, this gainer, if used properly, will deliver results you will notice in the mirror. I've used several other gainers, and Cytogainer is my favorite. If consumed regularly throught the day, pre and post workout, it will energize you to lift more. Once you've torn your muscles to pieces, you'll feel it quickly refueling them, making you eager to return to the gym the next day. The taste is acceptable, and improved with milk. I've tried chocolate, cookies and cream, and banana, which was the best of the three. I'm excited to boost my bulk with a round of Cytogainer (probably 3weeks), and plan to document the before/after on my body space.\n",
      "Helped me gain 10  lbs of lean muscle since my metabolism is so fast. It tastes better the ON Whey protein and mixes better!\n",
      "I have been taking this on and off for the last 3 months and I've gained around 15lbs. I love the taste of the cookies and cream and it's such a deal if you only use two scoops because it'll last you longer than any other weight gainer and it has 11,000+ grams of glutamine so there's no longer any need to take glutamine and you get 1.5grams of creatine so you're also saving money on creatine. Highly recommend this product!\n",
      "\n",
      "it really works and helps put on the pounds\n",
      "\n",
      " I can't recommend it enough for any ecotomorph out there or anyone looking to gain weight.\n",
      "It has given me the energy and mass I am needing. The product was at the right price and delivered on time. Another great job for the compony and Bodybuiling.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cytogainer is one of the few such products that isn't packed with empty filler sugar calories that many other gainer products contain.  Each 2 scoop serving contains 37 grams of carbs but only 5 of them are listed as \"sugar.\" Other gainer products have a sugar content that nearly matches the carb content. In addition to the 37 grams of carbs the same 2 scoops also has 27 grams of protein (double all these numbers if you are using four scoops per serving). This is a great post workout recovery supplement since it contains both protein and carbohydrates (many protein powders have only a few grams of carbs).\n",
      "Great product if your looking to put on some weight! i like it because it has a good amount of protein and includes some creatine. The taste is not bad at all, and much better then many other products i have tried. Defiantly will be picking up more of this stuff when i run out!\n",
      "I love this stuff! I'll start by saying it mixes really well. You might not even need a shaker for this one. It tastes amazing, and is FDA inspected. You don't have to worry about banned substances or anything for those of you who have to pee in a bottle. I've gained roughly 12 pounds in two months and lowered my overall bodyfat. I take 2 servings right after a workout, and 1 serving a few hours later. Stack it with creatine and a good pre-workout like C4 and you should see sick gains!\n",
      " If you're looking to add protein and calories (54g protein, 560 Calories for every 4 scoops) to your daily intake, give CytoGainer a shot, but steer clear from Strawberries 'N Creme.\n",
      " Would have given this product a 9 overall if it didn't effect my skin this bad.\n",
      "Best tasting weight gainer I've ever tried! I couldn't even tell that I was drinking a protein shake. I only wish it had more calories for what it is...\n",
      "BEST WEIGHT GAINER OUT THERE! I consider myself a hardgainer, so i try and lift big, eat big and down the right weightgainer. This is the right one! Ive taking this twice and both times have gained and kept 5pounds. I tried other weightgainers out there maybe thinking the more calories and more carbs would do the trick but they left me feeling...idk, sloppy? The complex carbs in this is what i think does it for me, great taste and would recommend it to anybody looking to put on weight. I just bought the buy 2 get one free deal on BB.com n cant weight till after my contest to go back and use this to bulk. Great product, Highly recommended!\n",
      "This is a good product it just takes alot of shaking! Ive been doing two scoops with 16 oz. of milk and theres always chunks. I've been using this for about 3 weeks and have gained some weight, I mean calories are calories. I would recommend this to someone though.\n",
      "It's dessert after your workout! So tasty and mixes easily! I couldn't ask for a better gainer. I'm actually using 3 scoops a day rather than 4 scoops per serving. I find that I'm gaining lean muscle with out gaining extra fat! I weigh the same as I did 6 months ago but getting bigger and more defined muscles.\n",
      "Mixes easily, tastes great. Helped with putting on some muscle mass. If not working out enough though this could contribute to fat gains. Great for bulking.\n",
      " I definitely plan on purchasing more, but I am going to give some other flavors a whirl.\n",
      "This product was pretty awesome the taste was A+ and i mixed with water. Mixes very easy if you are on the go and have a shaker rather then a blender. I am hard gainer so i typically wouldn't see results with a product like this but I took it twice a day and gained 10 lbs over 3 weeks(coupled with intense workouts). Would Highly recommend if looking to put on mass.\n",
      "This is hands down the best protein/weight gainer supplement out there. Taste delicious with amazing results.\n",
      "I've been taking Cyto Gainer for over 5 months now. It tastes great, doesn't sit heavy in my stomach and is by far my favorite Protein shake I have found. Great for putting on muscle without getting fat.\n",
      "LOVE IT!!!\n",
      "i have just started bodybuilding, i have taken GNC whey protein, and a couple servings of Muscletech nitroteck before, but that was after light workouts so i havent experienced any gains yet. i just started lifting weights today and i took this, all i can say is that it tastes amazing and dosen't leave any lumps. after one container of cyto gainer(1 month) i gained 5lbs of muscle\n",
      "Great taste.. Noticing results gaining steady pounds started at 120 now 135 moved my bench 35 pnds to 190 and squat 50 pnds to 235\n",
      "I tried this out a while ago to put on size, and it did work. Put on quite abit of size, the taste was great it tasted exactly like the Hershey's cookies and creme chocolate. The only bad thing is after using it I started to loose some size I put on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did gain mass which was really good. downside only 18 servings,bloat, gas and thick. Taste is really good, mixes ok\n",
      "REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  TASTES GOOD AND MORE IMPORTANT MIXES GREAT. NO GLOBS TO CHOKE DOWN. I HAVE GAINED ABOUT 3 LBS. PAST 6-7 WEEKS, SINCE I STARTED TAKING IT REGULARLY. FIRST WEIGHT GAIN I FINISHED THE WHOLE CAN. ON MY THIRD.\n",
      "I really liked this gainer.  It helped me put on 5 lbs, just adding one shake after my lunch, and before bed. The mint chocolate tastes great too.  Although it did kinda make me sick of that mint taste after a while.  But out of all the gainers I've tried so far, this was the best.\n",
      "Great gainer that adds pounds. Also has some vitamins and minerals to supplement your multivitamin. Cytosport products always taste pretty good too.\n",
      "Ok look, if you're reading this, trying to figure out how to put on some size, without it all going to your gut......This is the stuff. I have tried several products over the years to try and put on some size without it making me feel fat. This stuff is the best I have ever used. if you follow the directions and workout like you are supposed to, you will put on some very lean size!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "the taste is easily the worst thing about this product. iv'e never had problems about downing my supplements but this is the first iv'e had trouble with. works fine though. okay pre i guess\n",
      "\n",
      "It's great for fueling my workouts, and I definitely have the ability to lift more when I drink this before a workout as opposed to when I don't. However the taste is awful. It says to drink most of it 30 minutes before your workout and the rest during your workout. I can never finish drinking it during the workout. The taste changes to bitter grossness and it literally makes me gag/almost throw up. So I just drink it before the workout, and drink it all pretty quickly before the taste gets worse.\n",
      "I am sensitive to caffeine so Fast Twitch has just enough for that push. I follow the directions for drinking it and it gets me through my 2-3 hour training sessions.\n",
      " Oh and... it tastes good. Not sure why people stated otherwise.\n",
      "I would consider this an average pre-work out supplement. It mainly has tons of caffeine (200 mg in it, avg person should only have 300mg per day) in it which gives you the jitters. Doesn't give you the pump that NO Xplode or Jacked will give you just a heightened awareness from all the caffeine. It smells really good, but doesn't not taste that great though.\n",
      "Taste is pretty good in my opinion, very tolerable if nothing else. I admit I don't care for Cytosport at all, but this product really gets it done for me. I take two scoops per workout out, and when it's buy 2 get 1 free, that's **** cheap so I don't mind. Great pumps with lasting energy. Super vasculation increase in size of working muscles during workout. Plus there's a little protein in it, which I always like. If for no other reason, the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "It tastes horrible. I can't stand the smell and it's loaded with artificial sweeteners that have a sickly smell and taste. It clogs the blender making a sticky paste. $50 down the drain, had to toss it.\n",
      "This has to be one of the worst tasting preworkouts on the market.  The powder does not break up easily and turns extremely frothy.  Also, I do not feel like this gives me the pump I have had with most other preworkouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought this to replace Twinlab MVP which was on backorder. Initiate is outstanding and my new Pre. The sustained release caffeine is great and keeps me moving through my 60 minute heavy weight training workouts. I am one of those people that does not get much out of creatine, so it was nice to see that it is not in this formula. The other ingredients are solid performers. I also add Monster Amino to my intra-workout water along with a little bit of Gatorade powder, and for post-workout I combine Muscle Milk with Cytocarb II which makes for awesome recovery. My daily protein has been Complete Whey for quite a while. Cytosport continues to put out quality products, so I keep coming back to them.\n",
      "Pretty cheap for what you are getting and tasted fine. Not the best out there but probably the best I have tried under $40\n",
      "I started using this about a year ago. I work out only sporadically due to various reasons. However, drinking this after my weightlifting workouts really keeps the soreness down. I used to get so sore that I could hardly move 2 days later. (had serious delayed muscle soreness) I am looking to lose weight, but build and maintain muscle, but not to bulk up too much. I use this drink both as a recovery drink, and post workout meal. Hope to be much more consistent in the coming months, and I'll get a better idea of what else it can do. I have used it after a hard bicycle ride, and it helped me recover. It's best when very cold, but in a pinch, it'll work at room temperature. \n",
      "Best protein product I've ever found, taste, blend of proteins, and high in potassium and healthy fats. If you can afford it and looking for a little bulk, there is nothing better.\n",
      "This is a great boost of protein, and great after a hot workout. Cookies and Creme is good, but it gets to be a bit too much after a while. Also have tried the Chocolate, and it's much better. \n",
      "\n",
      "A great product for the person who is on the go and cannot always carry powder. Alittle pricy per serving but you do get what you pay for. The Chocolate shake is probably the best tasting shake I have ever had. A  \n",
      "The best RTD protein shake I ever had, got the chocolate. The flavor is full, and the formula isn't too thick.\n",
      "just a fantastic product!! highly recommend it and it tastes AMAZING!\n",
      "Best tasting protein drink I've ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best protein powders I've ever used (and hands-down the best tasting). It seems like a small serving of protein for how big the scoops are, but it's quality and it has some carbs and fats. Don't get me wrong, though, it's not excessive; I actually mix it with milk when I want more macros, but mixed with water works well when I'm trying to work building lean muscle. I have it post-workout and right before bed, then sometimes with breakfast or as part of a quick meal.\n",
      "Also, it's LACTOSE FREE; I'm not lactose intolerant or anything, but a lot of protein powders out there add excessive lactose and fiber, so they make me bloated and uncomfortable. This stuff doesn't add lactose or have excessive fiber, so it's easy on my guts, even if I have it more than twice a day.\n",
      "Finally, it mixes just fine, with water and/or milk. Whoever says it's clumpy doesn't know how to shake a shaker bottle. Seriously, I don't even need a mixing-wire-ball or anything.\n",
      "Highly recommend. Chocolate is a great, basic choice for flavor.\n",
      "Disappointed thinking I got a good deal, but doesn't mix well and no flavor. I oopsed and didn't notice the giant scoop was only 16 grams of protein. That should have been my first clue.\n",
      "Not the best I've had, not the worst I've had. Doesn't shake well - remains very very clumpy and then you're sipping clumps of powder. Fine in a blender. Not too sweet, which is great.\n",
      "Bought this because it's relatively cheap source of protein,although not the best top notch premium ingredients compared to others, it still helped to build my lean body. It has higher carbs and fats content than most proteins,so I limit my muscle milk consumption by taking them in the morning once I wake-up. My post workout shake in the evening, I take an isolate protein brand with no fats and <1g carb. If you take too much of muscle milk,you my gain weight,so be careful. I enjoy the milkshake taste of muscle milk,they tastes so **** good with milk. I've been taking them for months, and lost 4lbs still. I'd recommend drinking this delicious shake in the morning, so it burns off later throughout the day,and take isolate proteins closer to the night. Smart workout and diet plan will lead to weight loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've used muscle milk for a few years now and it's my absolute favorite brand flavor wise out of every other brand I've tried. Not a huge fan of the gritty texture, but I have found that drinking it extremely cold (adding ice) helps to cut down on that texture. I drink this protein strictly to gain weight as I have an extremely high metabolism. Muscle milk does help me gain the weight I need. \n",
      "Great taste though a little grainy. But all of the nutrition I was looking for in a protein shake at a great price. Can't beat it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the taste and mixes well with water or milk.\n",
      "love the taste - mixes well with milk\n",
      "Great product and taste great also\n",
      "My hubby loves the graham cracker flavor with unsweetened vanilla almond milk... its such a treat!  It's his favorite protein by far as he typically hates the taste of any supplement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this six is tasty and works for what I need it for... I swear by it\n",
      "best flavor I have tried so far\n",
      "I use protein shakes for meal replacements and dietary protein boosters. Mixes well, no overwhelming whey flavor or smell (which I can't stand) and goes down smooth. Great recovery drink after exercise and morning protein supplement. \n",
      "Loved using this product as a nutrition shake.  If you're a college athlete this is a great product.  Pretty sure it is certified and safe for them to take as well.  Taste is always amazing as well, no matter which flavor.  For those looking for a general nutrition/protein shake this is a great start.  \n",
      "Excellent taste...would be great to have a bit more protein to calorie ratio, but can't beat the taste.\n",
      "I honestly cannot say enough about Muscle Milk. It is by FAR my favorite protein powder on the market. The macros are not the best, which is what keeps me from making it my primary protein powder, but despite that, Muscle Milk will always have a place on my protein shelf. I like to mix a scoop of Muscle Milk with my Optimum Nutrition or MusclePharm protein to give it some added thickness, flavor, and slower digesting protein. The flavors are top notch and they taste amazing in milk AND water! Seriously, it tastes nearly identical in water. Each time I drink Muscle Milk, the more I love it. CytoSport is a great company and will definately buy more Muscle Milk in the future. I couldn't recommend it enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried both the chocolate and strawberry banana flavors with water and I have no complaints what so ever. This product will always be my go to for protein! \n",
      "I caught this on sale and bought three two-pound buckets of Graham Cracker, Cookie Dough and Chocolate. The Cookie Dough was 'meh' but the other two were great. The best tasting protein shake I've had in a while was the result of one scoop Graham Cracker, one scoop Chocolate, and then a 1:1 milk/water combination. Not too heavy and terrific taste. I did not enjoy the product as much when used only w/ water, but I made it work when I had to. It's too bad there isn't more protein in each serving and that I found myself having to use two scoops for each protein shake. The low price-point still makes this an affordable product, but to get 25+ grams of protein in each shake, I will probably look elsewhere for a better price-per-serving.\n",
      "Good product but this flavor needs some work.  No wait, this flavor needs A LOT of work.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Worst flavor I've ever had.  All others are really good, the best out there.  This one is not.  \n",
      "Have used this protein since 2006.  Has aided me everytime I want to put on mass as well as serve as a meal supplement while on the go.  Tastes great and mixes well even with other ingredients like creatine.\n",
      "CLUMPED TOO EASILY, I AM TIRED OF SWALLOWING CHUNKS OF THIS STUFF, REGARDLESS OF THE MIXING ACTIVITY.\n",
      "MAYBE THE LIGHT VERSION IS BETTER??/\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember when this was the best protein powder out there. Not no more. I am not sure what they changed in it but it is horrible. I think it has to much filler in it. Tasted chalkie. \n",
      "Musclemilk is an amazing supplement. Love the balanced protein, fat, and carbs. Taste is average, but seriously, who cares? My muscles always feel full when taling musclemilk. My only complaint is price. Its a bit too expensive since you need two scoops.\n",
      "I have been using Muscle Milk for over 10 years and I am still happy with this product. I have tried numerous other products over the years but always come back to Muscle Milk. Although Banana CrÃ¨me is my favorite at the moment, other flavors are good as well. The product has been consistently good, it mixes well and the taste is excellent with consistent results.\n",
      "Muscle Milk has been my favorite for a couple of years.  I've tried lots of different whey (eg. optimum nutrition gold standard whey, cellucor, etc.) and muscle milk tastes the best and provides the best results. With the other wheys I will fell more sore the day after working out, whereas with muscle milk my body feels less sore and my muscles look fuller.  The energy and lack of muscle fatigue the next day is a great benefit.  Pretty much all of the flavors are good but I recommend staying away from the \"natural\" flavors, especially vanilla. The vanilla cream is MUCH MUCH better.\n",
      "I purchased three flavors to take advantage of the buy two get one free and they all tasted pretty much the same. And it wasn't a good taste. Very disappointed with the taste of this product. However, it does give you protein (although not even half of the amount of another brand that I have tried that tastes much better) and other vitamins and minerals.\n",
      "I like the cookies 'n creme. I'm 3 weeks out from a show in tupelo. I think it's a good product because it's not high in sugar and doesn't cause any gi issues after you drink it. The taste is great. Not chalky and dissolves easily in water, so no clumps. \n",
      "Taste great\n",
      "I had very high expectations for this based on the ratings but it just didn't meet them. It tasted average at best and had a weird aftertaste. Mixability was terrible and it left a very hard to clean residue in my shaker. The only reason I bought it because I expected it to taste better than Myofusion or ON but sadly it did not. Would not recommend.\n",
      "I have been drinking muscle milk off and on for a while. A few months ago I picked protein drinks back up. I was drinking generic grocery store brands out of convenience. Last week I was reminded that I have a Muscle Milk container sitting on top of the fridge catching dust. I pulled it down and basically finished it off faster than I would have the generics. I felt amazing! I decided to stick to Muscle Milk like I should have in the first place, rather than the generic grocery store stuff. I saw a new flavor and decided to give it a chance. No ratings on it so i didn't really know how it would taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "All I can say is, This flavor is amazing! I am back to buy even more!! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "best meal replacement ever recommended for all \n",
      "The banana flavor is excellent, almost like nesquick.  The strawberry is also good but not as sweet as nesquick.  The orange is also good.\n",
      "Cookies n' CrÃ¨me unreal!!!!! Haven't seen much for results, but I'll most likely get another jug. It tastes good and I need the protein.\n",
      "Just got my jug of German Chocolate Cake. It is the exact same color, smell and taste of German Chocolate Cake, amazing. If you are a chocolate fan, go for it. You won't regret the purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cake Batter was good, but not great. Kind of weak on the flavor intensity, but otherwise a tasty protein mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vanilla Creme, the OG, can't go wrong with a plain vanilla flavor. If you like vanilla that is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mix two heaping scoops of MM with water, mostly. If I have the extra calories for the day, sometimes I'll use coconut milk. Going to try the Graham Cracker after the German Chocolate Cake runs out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best tasting protein ever made. Have tried all best sellers but nothing comes even close. My fav flavours:\n",
      "1. Cookies n Cream 10/10\n",
      "2. Banana cream 10/10\n",
      "I've had strawberries n cream and banana cream both epic.  Mix with some BB creatine and them lift numbers shoot up. Folks that say MM makes you gain weight don't lift hard enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "MuscleMilk is by far the best tasting protein around.  If there is somebody you are going to introduce to protien powders and are worried about them not liking it, this is the way to go!\n",
      "Orange Creme is good.  Should be sweeter.\n",
      "Graham Cracker is excellent.\n",

      "I have tried Peanut Butter Chocolate, Chocolate, Cake Batter, Brownie Batter, Red Velvet Cake, Blueberries & Cream, Orange & Cream, Cookies & Cream, Chocolate Mint, & Mocha Latte... Needless to say I'm a big fan of Muscle Milk. I really enjoy the taste and the thickness of it. I like to put a scoop of it in my oatmeal in the mornings (preferably Blueberries & Cream or Peanut Butter Chocolate). \n",
      "\n",
      "This flavor rules. Doesn't clump up, goes down easy, no gas. Would buy again in a heartbeat!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mocha Latte (Monster Milk) was my favorite protein mix. They stopped making it recently, so I sent an email to CytoSport to find out what happened.  Customer Service informed me it was obsolete, but Muscle Milk had the same flavor.  I purchased a 2.5lb tub to try it...\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it has no similarity whatsoever to the Monster Milk one.  I'm not sure why they called it Mocha Latte, it does not taste like Mocha Latte at all.  I'm a big CytoSport fan, but this one missed the mark.  Sorry, Cyto.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Delicious, reliable, effective. Every time I try a new protein powder it's never as good as this\n",
      "\n",
      "I buy it simply because the cookies n' creme flavor with milk tastes better then most milk shakes and I use it when Im in the mood for a quick protein packed snack. Love the taste. \n",
      "Very flavorful. Works great as an MRP, which is exactly what I use it for. The Banana is very tasty in Almond Milk and Milk. The Glutamine, Casein, Whey, and Vitamin blend in the powder is a very useful flurry of ingredients that I appreciate. The price per serving is also very reasonable. I WOULD NOT USE THIS AS YOUR ONLY PROTEIN POWDER IF YOU ARE TRYING TO CUT/LOSE WIGHT. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a Great tasting protein I use it mostly as a meal replacement I have also lost 29 pounds in just 5 weeks using this as a meal replacement one of my 2-3 150 to 200 calorie snacks a day. I mix it one scoop with 12 ounces of almond milk vanilla unsweetened once a day and sometimes I use it one scoop with 12 ounces of almond milk after a good workout. just ordered the smore's flavor and will review the taste once it arrives from bb.com 08/12/13 Just received the order from bb.com and tried the smores MM it is better than the cookies and cream and I loved the cookie and cream I would say it is more of a graham cracker with light chocolate taste than a full on smore but still awesome. would defiantly order this again after I try others \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a rip off, they have 32grams of protein in 2 scoops. Also there scoops are massive, probablly double the size of one regular protein scoop. Im drinking whey protein for the protein and not the taste, stop bull****ting cytosport.\n",
      "Best Protein flavor I have had. A must for anyone interested in Cyto Sport\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love German Chocolate Cake so I thought this was the perfect protein powder for me. I was wrong! It tastes nothing like the flavor, unfortunately.\n",
      "I usually love muscle milk. For me, on its own the brownie batter flavour tastes like dirty socks. But tastes good when mixed with vanilla isolate. Go figure.\n",
      "\n",
      " it is what it is.\n",
      "Terrible *****, Chunky, Chalky. BUT! The recovery aspect when taking two servings a day is on point. \n",
      "Used Muscle Milk off and on for many years. Never fails to deliver. Great quality and great taste.\n",
      "First time trying this and I don't care for it.  First of all, misleading - it takes two scoops to get the 32 grams of protein, not one.  The taste is chalky and there's way too much mint added to the taste.  I'll go back to using what I was using before.   \n",
      "Tastes awesome.\n",
      "Love muscle milk products! However, this flavor did not deliver. There was no presence of the flavor it promised. It was not bad tasting, there was no bad after taste, it simply did not deliver a convincing chocolate chip cookie dough flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty awesome cheesecake flavor.  I also got the orange creme flavor, which is also pretty good as well and I go between this and that right now.\n",
      "Love the product and the taste, it doesn't taste or have the texture of chalk. Seems to be a well balanced protein for me to gain weight and add muscule\n",
      "Muscle Milk has allowed me to add muscle and lose weight at the same time.  Some say its impossible, but I have been doing it. Due to the fact that it is low in carbohydrates I stacked it with BLOX by BPI. This has worked for me. The price is great, plus you can buy at your local gas station if you are in need.  Its a great snack! $1.00 a serving snack is better then any hamburger any where.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Awsome product, i lvoe it !!!\n",
      "I just started taking this, because I know my friends got results from this. The taste is excellent! It doesn't taste like cardboard or plastic, tastes like chocolate milk! Definitely won't get sick of the flavor if you're a chocolate lover like me!\n",
      "Effective product if you are looking to use something that is sold and available everywhere. It's more of a meal replacement if you ask me, at 310 cal. per serving I don't know who is drinking this in addition to a meal other than meatheads that wouldn't go anywhere near the muscle milk product. Most of their flavors are average but leave something to be desired because of their distinct \"protein aftertaste\" and grittiness. I have high hopes for Raspberry Cheesecake and Graham Cracker though. They are coming to me now! Reviews later.\n",
      "Started back taking this great pro, use to take years ago. One protein that does not give me stomach issue. Muscle Milk gets a bad rap bcuz of the fat yet its healthy fat and if you seem to keep your fat intake under control then this shouldn't hurt you!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a go-to flavor for my Muscle Milk drinking.  The Vanilla is exactly what you expect it to be.  Some of the Muscle Milk flavors are very artificial, but Vanilla really tastes like a Vanilla shake.  Delicious.  \n",
      "Also found that you can mix this with some of the sub par flavors to mask the taste.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite protein powders as far as taste goes. I wouldn't take it if I were trying to cut, but for bulking or maintaining the mass you have, it's perfect. It's usually my morning or lunch shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must say I've tried several flavors of Muscle Milk and I haven't been that impressed but Eggnog really tastes like Eggnog without all the excess fat and calories!  I use it as my post workout shake and it is a great treat after a hard workout.  I've also noticed that it keeps me fuller longer than a lot of other protein brands I've tried.  If you like Eggnog around the holiday season I highly recommend you give this a try!\n",
      "I always wanted to try muscle milk, but it's a bit expensive for what I usually like to spend on whey.  When I saw it go on sale, I loaded up on it and thought I would try bulking on it.  I got blueberries, chocolate caramel peacan, chocolate malt, and strawberries and creme.  Reading the label, its quite a good product on every level especially if your trying to bulk.  Vitamins, minerals, high protein, low cholestrol, low sodium, aminos, and  glutimine.  For me tho, the taste was horrible.  Usually I can choke down anything for the sake of a better workout.  Maybe I've just gotten use to better tasting proteins.  It doesn't matter what the flavor, it all has the same bad after taste.  Also this stuff did a number on my stomach.  It digests really slow, so it's difficult for me to maintain my normal appitite when I have more than one shake a day.  -After two months of use, I still have like six 2lbs tubs left to work my way through.  There are very few products that I would not buy again.  This is one of them.  For me the price is too high, the taste is too bad, and my stomach doesn't seem to like it much.\n",
      "overall good protein blend. easy on the stomach and taste is pretty good. itss more like a creamy vanilla rather then chocolate chip cookie dough. still reccomended\n",
      "amazing as it getsss.... awsum taste and results... amazing\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistency of the shake was good, very smooth.  It mixed very well.  Texture was much better than most other powders that I have tried.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste of White Chocolate Mousse is very bitter.  It almost tasts like soap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is still one of my favorites, I never get tired of it. it keeps getting better as they add more flavors.\n",
      "Love this product! Will continue to use! Only downside is price.\n",
      "Best tasting protein shake i've ever tasted with a great formula. No replacement for muscle milk\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to drink the vanilla but I have been in love with Syntha-6 mochaccino. I went to a store and picked up a cake batter rtd and it is awesome. This stuff tastes so good I am really excited. I doubt I can get burnt out on this flavor.\n",
      "Best Banana on the market!\n",
      "One of the best protein resources. So, MM has a few of fat and calories, who desires cutting , is not recommended.\n",
      "For the past about 8 months, I've been including a generous dose of Muscle Milk to my diet. Overtime it has come to replace some of the things that were wrong with my diet. The difference to my energy levels has been incredible and the result effect to my training has been better than anything I'd tried before. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I have always been a fan of muscle milk. Then i tried the new Graham Cracker flavor... IT TASTES AMAZING! By far the best tasting protein I've ever had (and i've tried a bunch of them). Not the best formula out there (hence the 9), but its great for a post workout shake. And it tastes amazing, especially when you mix it with milk.\n",
      "I like MuscleMilk products because they taste good. I bought Graham Cracker to try out the new taste. And It's really not that good. It doesn't suck. But I think Cookies n Cream taste alot better.\n",
      "Graham Cracker has amazing taste! Ive tried every flavor and I like this one the best! Cytosport has the greatest tasting protein ive ever tried!!\n",
      "I tried Muscle Milk before in a different flavor and it was pretty good. I saw this new flavor and wanted to give it a try. Great taste with little after taste.\n",
      "This stuff tastes Great! I mix one scoop with a cup of almond milk and ice for 200 cal meal or snack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking to add a gainer to my daily supplement regimen and found this product's nutritional values to align with my needs. I have been using BSN Syntha 6 for a couple years with excellent results and no negative side affects. Upon receiving this product and trying it for the first 2-3 times, it caused me severe GI discomfort, and I was only doing the lighter recommended serving size of 2 scoops 1-2 times daily.  Temporary digestive discomfort is of course typical of adding a new protein product to your diet, especially with a mass gainer like this, and I expected the discomfort to go away after the first few days of use. However, after about 10 uses, my discomfort did not subside. In fact it worsened and I have since stopped using the product and am actively researching another one. Everyone's body is different and I wouldn't say that I have a weak or sensitive stomach, but this product is definitely not for me.\n",
      "As a hard gainer, I love this stuff.  Mixes great with a blender ball.  As always with Cytosport, it tastes great. Would highly recommend as post workout drink or meal replacement for on the go.  There are cheaper alternatives for people on a budget, but for me the convenience outweighs the price.  Great stuff!\n",
      "Over all I really like this product. It has a great taste and mixed well and does not taste chalky like other proteins I have had. I'm on my second tub of this and I would really recommend this product.\n",
      "I am a hardgainer that had difficulty putting on weight. I've tried several other weight gainers but nothing worked like the Muscle Milk Gainer. I've gained a few pounds in 10 days. I will be buying more in the next few days. It tastes great...better than most weight gainers. You will not be disappointed! \n",

      "The lower calorie brother of the original Muscle Milk is excellent tasting if you like Banana flavored things. It tastes just like a dessert, so I use it as a fake out cheat meal.\n",
      "Currently drinking this as I write this review. This product is a great value. I hate the taste of any nasty protein, but this one tastes great! I mix it with milk little extra protein, while enhancing the taste and texture. Tastes like a milkshake. Overall great product!\n",
      "I love this protein! I mix the vanilla with fresh strawberries and it is delicious!\n",
      "I would definitely recommend!\n",
      "This is a great protein supplement. Most flavors are good except for the Strawberries N' Creme which is NASTY. This has made a big difference for me. The Light version has much less fat which is great for us older guys with slower metabolism. Highly Recommended!\n",
      "This is by far my favorite protein drink! I use one scoop of powder, 4 oz. skim milk, 4 oz. water, ice cubes and 1/2 banana. Mix in a blender for a delicious chocolate protein shake, which I consume every day at 10am. Considering this is a powder based protein, it has a nice creamy texture. Absolutely recommend!\n",
      "Love this! The light is great for someone like me who is just trying to be in good shape, but not a workout addict. I will definitely buy this from here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this product. It so far has been one of the only products I can actually get down without being grossed out about the taste. It really does taste like cookies and cream. Its not too heavy either!\n",
      "Excellent product. Tastes Great. Been using it for 2 yrs and LOVE IT!!!!\n",
      "For those of us who have been on the supplement bandwagon for a while, this might not taste that bad. But compared to other flavor options (or adding natural, sugar free peanut butter to a chocolate shake and blending yourself), this takes really really bad. Tolerable in a pinch, but not something I would chose again. I am returning for an exchange\n",

      "super\n",

      "By far the best tank I've ever bought, so I bought a 2nd\n",
      "Great tank, followed the sizing chart and fits great. Might be slightly long for what I'm use to but it's not that big of a deal. Tag says 5% max shrinkage after wash. Thick material, but not so think it's overheating you, it feels supportive. Tight, but not compression tight. Overall a great shirt, I plan on getting a few more.\n",
      "Great tank top. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely my favorite tank top, I love the think fabric and form fitting of it!  Thank you to the beautiful Jen Jewell for recommending Dcore for athletic apparel!\n",
      "I love this product for several reasons.  First, it mixed easier than most other Whey powders out there.  So easy that I usually just mix it with skim milk using a spoon.  Second, it tastes great.  It reminds me of Strawberry Quick I drank as a kid.  Because of the great taste and ease of mixing right in the glass I drink it upon waking every morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first brand of protein I've tried and I'm definitely not going to look for another brand - this one is absolutely perfect for my needs. I like that it has less calories than others that I have seen; I don't really work out a lot, and I mostly needed to take protein because I recently went vegetarian. It tastes amazing blended with milk and a banana and I can't wait to try other flavors!\n",
      "I have tried several protein powders over the last 6-7 yrs and this one is by far the most delicious. It is the best for mixing without clumping into oatmeal or to make protein pancakes. I also use it once daily in the blender with fruit, yogurt, and or milk. I will never use another protein powder, this one has been amazing for delivering amino acids to my muscles after a workout. Highly recommended.\n",
      "These bars were garbage, though I have had worse believe it or not, thats why I gave it a 3.\n",
      "When I received the bars, the caramel had melted out of the chocolate and it was impossible to eat without making a mess. \n",
      "Additionally, the protein portion was very difficult to chew with a somewhat chalky flavour/texture.\n",
      "I do not reccommend.\n",
      "I ordered 2 boxes of 12 bars each. Taste great. Great as meal replacment or to get rid of craving for something sweet...i'll try the lean muscle bar on my next order.\n",
      "too much sodium and saturated fat for my tastes but some people might not mind taste is pretty descent though\n",
      "Great tasting bars, truly a more candy-like taste than other bars out there. I love that it's got great taste and still is low in sugar. Great meal replacement that will keep you going til you have time to sit down and grub out! I find these bars especially convenient if I'm running late in the morning and can't prepare a hot breakfast. No fattening drive-thru greasebomb biscuits for me, thanks!\n",
      "I've always liked Detour bars in the past. I've tried many different brands as well. They were out of caramel/peanut so I tried these. They are my new favorite! These are delicious! \n",
      "\n",
      "These bars are tastey, and don't have much grit or powder texture you would expect from a power bar.  The 32g of protein are nice in one bar.  I usually eat half between breakfast and lunch, and the other half between lunch and dinner.\n",
      "Great taste,great as meal replacment or when i crave something sweet.\n",
      "Good!!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is by far one of the the best tasting protein bars I have eaten. It literally tastes like a candy bar. It has 3g sugar, 32g of protein, and tons of vitamins and minerals. It is overall a great bar and fills you up too! The only downside is the saturated fat content. Other than that, it is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone dieting or bulking for a snack on-the-go if you don't have time for a meal.\n",
      "All Detour bars taste amazing, but these don't have a comparison. I'm in Love with these bad boys. 32 grams of protein with 3 sugar, AND some extra Omega-3's? Cannot be beat!!\n",
      "tastes great and has lots of protein, tastes like a candy bar but is still a great meal replacement. However does have a lot of fat\n",
      "Very good taste and texture, like a less syrupy/sugary granola.  \n",
      "I actually didn't notice these were by detour when I was ordering and was hesitant about trying them. I'm actually not a big fan of detour. But the peanutbutter chocolate was very decent. Almost like quaker granola bars, however the apple cinnamon had more of that artificial flavor I'm used to with the regular detour bars. Overly sweet and not that great. These smart bars are both definitely better than regular detour bars. More of an amped up granola bar.\n",
      "This bar is definitely my favorite! Normally I buy quest bars but I received one of the coconut bars as a sample and loved it! It's not dense and impossible to chew. The consistency is slightly chewy with a little crunch. I've tried it as an afternoon snack as well as prior to my workouts and have been overall pleased with how long it holds me over.  As a snack I paired it with string cheese and it held me over for nearly 3 hours. On lighter workout days I've eaten it on an empty stomach with my pre workout and been fine. I highly recommend this product and if you order coconut get more than one......it's usually out of stock!\n",
      "This bar was fantastic! I can't wait to try more flavors. I love that it is GF and non GMO. It has a good amount of protein and fiber as well. Great product. \n",
      "Its great to start your day or to get some carbs right after your workout. All of detours products are solid but as far as something with complex carbs this product taste good and is convenient.\n",
      "I love the idea of having a crunchy, chewy protein bar to mix up the monotony of your typical firm but chewy power-bar type protein bars.  Low in sugars and fat but high in protein makes this the perfect snack.  However, this flavor is not great.  It had this yogurt-frosting paste that carried the \"vitamin\" taste with it..overall I think this flavor just needs a re-work to make it more comparable to the other protein bars with much better flavor.  Otherwise, I do like the crunchiness of this bar, makes it seem like it has more substance.\n",
      "I tried the blueberry and cranberry. They are a little chewy, but the flavor was good. Not as chewy as a powerbar, softer than that at least. Still not a pleasant bar unless you are conditioned to think protein bars are like candy bars. As a dieter who cuts out as much sugar as possible, I appreciated they were only 3g or 4g of sugar and an adequate midday meal replacement with a protein shake. \n",

      "This multivitamin has some good points and some bad. The positive is that it contains a lot of plant based greens, such as broccoli, ect. The main drawback of this multi is that it contains D2 and not D3 as its form of vitamin D. Most research shows that D3 is the much preferred form. I also wish the product did not contain eleuthero root because I read that one should not drink alcoholic beverages after taking this, which I occasionally have a drink and can't take the multi on those days.\n",

I was disappointed right out of the box. The jug says new and improved. Why would you improve on a flavor that already won awards for taste? If it's not broke don't fix it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I instantly noticed the taste was worse. It's not terrible but the old flavor I rated a 10, this one is at best 7. My other problem is I get horribly smelly gas from this one now. I don't know what they changed but they're idiots for doing it. It's been unavailable for a few months now and the manufacturing date is May 2015. So why has this product been unavailable everywhere for so long? I don't know what's going on with this company but they took a step back on this product. \n",
      "Just place a call with Dymatize customer service. Seem like Dymatize is \"Clueless\" as to when they will have this product on the market again. Rating for the product is excellent. Rating for the company Dymatize is a big FAT ZERO!\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommend do not purchase Dymatize product since the company is so unreliable.\n",
      "Best Vanilla flavor I have tasted so far. Doesn't stick to the sides of the blender, unlike the chocolate.\n",
      "This is my go to protein powder. I have been looking around for a protein powder without any artificial flavors. Currently only gold standard ON, iso-zero mucletech, and elite whey fit the bill. Haven't really tried iso-zero since it comes out pretty pricy, but elite whey does taste better than gold standard ON imo. The protein content itself is pretty solid, you can feel it after weeks of supplementing with it. \n",
      "Tasted terrible.  I've never had to return a product before, but this stuff made me gag.\n",
      "Very good protein powder. I have tried several and this is one of the better ones. I chose this one because it does not have a bunch of artificial sweeteners that are typically found in the more popular supplements. (What is the point of having harmful chemicals in a supplement that is used to help you build strength and endurance. That to me is counterproductive!)  It dissolves fairly quickly in milk or water and tastes good. Also, it is a great value for the money costing substantially less than other brands for the same amount of protein. I use it everyday and it is effective in helping me to build muscle, especially since I am of a thin build to start with.\n",
      "Taste good with water or milk, doesn't have a laundry list of ingredients, awesome natural protein for the $$...  \n",
      "I am very picky with the protein flavors/ingredients. I've been looking for a nice Vanilla whey protein for months, cause it's really hard to find a good vanilla protein flavor. This one is amazing, best I've ever tried by far (and I already tried a bunch of good brands, like ON Nutrition, Protizyme; other Dymatize protein). You can actually feel the vanilla flavor but it's not too strong.Perfect for cooking (like cakes and for a bunch of deserts). And best of all, it only has STEVIA, no sucralose or other sugars.\n",
      "This is my go-to protein powder and a staple. This one and Iso 100. Both are amazing products with no fillers and junk added!\n",
      "I have no complaints.. calorie wise, it's perfect, and the taste is awesome. The chocolate mixes well and its tastes great with just water alone. No milk needed to \"spice it up\".\n",
      "First off, I love that this protein powder's ingredients list isn't 15 pages long.  The less additives the better!  However, when i switched to this product it destroyed my stomach for a couple days. It was likely just something with my system that did not like it.  Since then, I haven't had any issues with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor wise, I find it a bit too strong.  It kind of screams artificial vanilla.  I would recommend trying a different flavor.\n",
      "My favorite post-workout whey protein suppliment. I mix it with carbohydrate powder. The best guality, in my humble opinion.\n",
      "love it !\n",
      "Happy to have a great tasting protein without sucralose and its a good value as well. Chocolate flavor is good but I like gourmet vanilla the best. My only wish is that it was entirely isolate but still great.\n",
      "Just Awesome !!! Mixes well, tastes good and does the job of feeding your muscles real well ... Plus , it's free of any artificial sweeteners and stuff. My number 1 Go To Protein !!! Dymatize has some of the best quality proteins out there and this another great example . \n",
      "Honestly I have always been skeptic about flavors other than chocolate, but after trying out the vanilla flavor (which was just amazing) I decided I will be trying out different flavors from now on. 25 grams of natural protein for this price, definitely a keeper. Although I do have to say that I am the kind of person that likes to try out different brands. But this protein is a must buy again.\n",
      "Great taste. Solid profile. All Natural. Can't ask for much more!\n",
      "I was looking to find a protein powder without all the \"garbage\" in it so I gave this one a try.  I found it to be incredibly bitter tasting, even when mixed with milk.  I even resorted to mixing in some stevia to make it more palatable.  I am now using it only in my baking.  The \"strawberry\" flavor is weak enough it doesn't overpower the ingredients I'm cooking with.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using dymatize protein powders for a long time and LOVE them so I decided to try this one as well. I think the flavor is awesome even without Sucralose. My only issue is digestibility. I am very sensitive to products with lactose and this one does give me slight issues. I have no problem with the original Elite or this Iso-100. Overall it is worth a little bit of discomfort and excellent for the price!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking for a different whey to try out after my Phase 8 ran out; something mostly natural with no artificial sweeteners.  I chose this because it had an excellent price to with a good macro profile.  I was worried that because of the all-natural ingredients, it would taste horrid or mix badly, but I was way wrong.  Excellent texture when shaken with water (like thick whole milk), no clumps AT ALL, and as good a flavor as I've ever had.  As long as the price stays reasonable, this is probably my whey for quite a while.\n",
      "What happened? I have used and loved this protein for almost 2 years and it's great because it doesn't have sucralose and it used to actually taste ok.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the new flavor just plain sucks! New formula??? Can we get the old one back?? Sheesh. \n",
      "Love this protein powder. It mixes well, is not chalky or lumpy, flavor is creamy and there is NO sucrilose in here. (aka Splenda)  It's sweetened with stevia and doesn't give me stomach cramps or bloating like Splenda products do.\n",
      "Not the best of flavor, the chocolate is light and you can taste the stevia in it.  That being said, it's the best bang for the buck you'll get in Whey protein. I love Dymatize for their commitment to all natural, no artificial colors or sweeteners. I mean, if you're doing this for your health, who wants chemicals?\n",
      "\n",
      "Great flavor, I like how it as a creamy taste that I can use to mix into my meals as well as shakes\n",
      "Great Taste and mixes up easy in water or milk!\n",
      "Good value for money. Tasty and I really appreciate that it's not full of fillers/creamers etc. (ahem, phase 8 looking at you.)\n",
      "I loved the original formula  I would go through 10lbs in just over a month.  I purchased the 10lb canister over three months ago and I still have over 5lbs left.  I will not be purchasing anymore, and I'll just buy samples from different companies until I find one that had the same great taste as the original dymatize whey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rich Chocolate tastes a bit off, distinct like a chemical chocolate. \n",
      "But, the Gourmet Vanilla tastes just fine.  I will re-order the vanilla but not the chocolate in the future.  \n",
      "Love this protein powder mainly because it all natural. I can't say anything about the flavor because I never drank it without a banana and almond butter, but even with those it's better than anything else I ever had. oh, and did I mention it's healthy!!!\n",
      "\n",
      " The final test was mixing it with a spoon and cup. No clumps and only took like 30 secs. I will buy again.\n",
      "This is a lie, it has GMO's in it, I'm calling bull shizz. \n",
      "If you're going clean this isn't for you, find something that says organic. I'm only posting this for people like me who wish to go clean/GMO free. I'm going to have to give this a 1 for false advertisement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a way I can get my money back?\n",
      "Highly disappointed at the deceit. You know what they say, \"All Natural!\" But did I mention the GMO's? I mean \"Slightly All Natural!\". \n",
      "Even though it doesn't really stand out in any way, Dymatize's Elite Isolate has everything you need. Decent taste, great mixability, and undoubtfully all the quality protein it promisses you. 5-stars due to its unbeaten cost-benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the Chocolate and Vanilla protein powders but the Strawberry is just AWFUL. I've run out of the other two and have a 2lb of the Strawberry that I refuse to eat. The flavour is just horrible. Stay away from this one. And this is coming from someone who typically LOVES strawberry flavour over chocolate or vanilla.\n",
      "This shake has a natural flavor that tastes really good in my opinion. I definitely recommend! Been using it for just over two yrs now, Love It!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried many different whey protein powders over the years and this is no doubt THE BEST one. I switched to Dymatize natural whey because Optimum's natural whey is a little pricier, and I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. I really didn't expect it to taste so good. It's ALMOST like drinking straight chocolate milk. Nes Quik comes to mind. I made my first shake with about 7 oz of water and it tasted fantastic. I then took it post workout with 16 oz of whole milk and ground up oats and it was even better. Mixes very smooth. The best part is it's all natural. GREAT PRODUCT!\n",
      "I really like this protein. The taste isn't bad, actually quite good and doesn't taste like it's full of chemical's ( because it's not ). I mostly like that it doesn't have sucralose or aspartame or any other really nasty chemicals in it. It mixes great with a shaker. I find it best with half water half milk (I use almond milk). Only negative is that in the blender it turns into a fluffy foam and doubles in size. DON'T blend it, just stir it in or shake it up. So far I've been very pleased and I'll buy it again!\n",
      "This is the best whey I've ever had. Tast great and I can see and feel a big difference with this stuff. I will buy more and you guys here at bb.com are top notch. Thanks and Shalom\n",

      " It was recommended by the owner of my 7 Minute Fitness Program. I have also recommended it on my blog. &amp;lt;http://7minutefitnesssuccess.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n",
      "Love this stuff!!! Mixes easy (I use water), tastes good and works!!! Put on about 5-7 lbs. of lean muscle in the past 2 months. I drink one shake (one scoop) before and after working out on a three day routine. It sits nice in my stomach so I don't feel over full during my work out. This product is my new gold standard for comparison of proteins.\n",
      "Love this whey protein! The \"rich chocolate\" flavor is so chocolatey....it's my chocolate fix each day. I was having a hard time meeting my protein intake so my trainer had me increase my intake to two scoops a day to get the much needed protein in. I'm very basic, just add water and ice and shake, nothing too fancy!\n",
      "This is a great tasting protien.I personally prefer it to the artificially flavored Dymatize whey isolates. vanilla is great tasting as well.I've consumed two 5lb sizes of each so far. really good stuff\n",
      "Taste is pretty good, good profile, good price.\n",
      " I'm enjoying the Dymatize Isolate quite a bit. The quality is very high, mixes very easily, and very easy to make on the go within a few secs. Instantly dissolves. Rich chocolate is not overly chocolaty but seems to be the right amount.\n",
      "Taste isn't too bad but has a weird taste (has a chemical taste and bad after taste). It works for now. Doesn't give me the caffeine boost and won't buy again. \n",
      "Great results for energy on those low energy days. I used this a lot for my morning fasted cardio sessions. The flavor was pretty good too, which always helps.\n",
      "Can't complain. I only rated an 8 because of my personal issues with caffeine. I can't handle as much as the regular person, but it does the job.\n",
      "It worked great, it gave me the push that I needed. Not much in it for the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor was great. I only ordered the 7 serving package so Idk about long term gains. But I would have preferred a non-caffeine option\n",
      "I juste received it yesterday with my balanced hydratation to add some flavor and electrolyte to the bcaa for using as intra workout.\n",
      "First, they seem having change the label, no more ajipure logo to show they use fermented amino acid. I'm waiting a reply from dymatize to know if they use fermented or no more.\n",
      "The product itself is very clean, smell nothing, white fine clean powder. For now I used it with my hydratation product, so the taste was not bitter.\n",
      "no probleme with dissolution, mix with my shaker, few shake and everything was disapear with NO FOAM on the top. Give me good endurance during my workout. It's a good product and great value for the price !\n",
      "UPDATE :  I have try it with nothing to add taste.. and like it smell, it taste NOTHING ! nothing discusting or bitter. remember that i use a 24oz watter shaker. Perfect Product !\n",
      "Very good taste. I offer this flavor over the lime flavor. Easy to sip on through out the day.\n",
      "Great value but won't mix with a spoon, have to use shaker \n",
      "Too many reviews discussing the \"flavor\" of an unflavored powder. This product works. End of story. If you're looking for cost-effective BCAAs in good protions, look no further. I'm an aspiring natural body builder, and when you can't rely on steroids or HGH to get the gains, you look to the stuff that works - BCAAs and by the buckets. This will amplify your protein synthesis and it will taste like chalk. Guaranteed. Take a scoop with every meal, every protein shake and during your workout - if you don't see results, that's on you. \n",
      "Great product, you can see the results within weeks. The bad thing about this BCAAs is the taste. It tastes pretty bad, would prefer some flavored version. But the bright side is that you are going to see the results, wait and see.\n",
      "I received this product free a while back when I purchased a 4 lb bottle of Elite XT protein, I was constantly adding it in with the Banana Nut flavored stuff so I never noticed the bitterness. It wasn't until I put some into my greek yogurt that I realized its not unflavored, but rather tastes extremely bitter. I tried adding it in with different protein powders and even incorporating it into my preworkout but still had no success. It sat on my shelf for the longest time and I eventually threw it out. Yes it has a decent BCAA count but in my opinion I would rather catch a buy one get one deal on a flavored BCAA and be able to drink it throughout the day. I do not see myself purchasing this again in the near future.\n",
      "I'm using the unflavored and obviously it tastes bitter, but not to the point where I can't drink it. I guess the closest taste it would be similar to is bitter tea, like Turkish tea. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of mix ability, forget about spoon stirring it. It'll just blob. For best mix ability, you need to use a shaker to have it fully mix. I found using warm water helps as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm currently using it for fasted morning workouts pre and post workout. I do feel it helps with my fasted workouts as I don't feel drained half way through the workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's the worst tasting thing in the world, but, eventually you get used to it. It does its job 100%! While trying to lose some fat, I haven't lost a pound of my muscle. Definitely recommend. I have read in other reviews others complaining that it doesn't mix well. OK, that's ture. However, try warm water, then give it a good shake, and it'll dissolve really well. \n",
      "This BCAA complex is pretty solid. Definitely aids in recovery and gains. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the issue of taste, it does taste like rat vomit mixed only with water. However, since it's  unflavored, I wasn't going to hold my breathe for it to taste great. I usually mix in some diet Sodastream syrup (e.g. orange or fruit punch) for intra-workout and that works great. I hardly notice it mixed in with my post-workout shake too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid product and a good deal, especially as a bonus item.\n",
      "This is the worst tasting product I`ve had in my entire life, makes me want to puke, the worst mix-ability ever and seriously taste awful... the pot is endless, i got it for free and had it 5 days and stopped drinking it, I bet not even rats will like it. Might work but dont want to puke my way to see if it does.... So this is a follow up comment i actually found a way to have this with good taste.. with yogurt of any flavor, just mix it until there is no white white pwder and thats it.\n",
      "I have no doubt that this product works as intended as I adore the Dymatize brand, BUT the metallic taste of this stuff is impossible. I can't even choke it down. Disgusting.\n",
      "They are what they are. Got them free, can't complain. \n",
      "doesn't dissolve,  awful taste\n",
      "It's a good BCAA, but they have a very bad mix, this causes us to lose a certain amount in the shaker. Don't recommended\n",
      "I usually mix it with my flavored creatine, preworkout, or bcaas. I've never had any problems with it mixing in or messing with the flavors of my other supplements. Gets the job done.\n",
      "Taste is disgusting!!!  Either gets caps or be ready to mix this into something else that can completely mask the taste, its like burnt PVC! Go for some other flavored product.  Thankfully I didn't waste my $ on this, it came free with other protein I purchased. Don't waste your $ either!\n",
      "The best unflavored BCAA powdered that I have had.  I have had no problems at all with mix ability or clumping.  I just throw two scoops into my shaker cup with water, add a little liquid water flavor and I have my own homemade BCAA drink to have intra workout.  It's a great money saver if you are training more that once a day and need to save your flavored aminos for those though workouts.  You can add it to almost anything, carbs, water, whatever you want and it works great.  I highly recommend! \n",
      "Very rare commodity. Rare because it 100% BCAA without additives. And it means that I'm paying only for what is really needed, rather than sugar and flavoring.\n",
      "Nasty taste. But then again, the result is important to me, not taste. \n",
      "Verdict. Excellent price / useful composition.\n",
      "Very bitter and doesn't mix well at all. I rarely get the entire spoon full to dissolve regardless of how much liquid I mix it into. If you get it for free, use it, but when i run out I will not be buying more of this.\n",
      "BCAA are great for the body, however this product taste is bitter, so, I mix it in a small amount of water and down it. \n",
      " You will have to stir the teaspoon of powder into your drink but will not mix well.\n",
      " \n",
      " Overall i give it an 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff seems to be doing the job. I've been taking the recommended serving everyday for 5 months now, and I still have half the tub left. It seems like it's a never ending tub! Mixes well with water, I add a scoop to my protein powder after workout. Every now and then the bitterness of this product will overpower my protein powder. Only if a little piece didn't blend. I would order this again. I'd say my recovery times have improved since taking this product. \n",
      "Simple BCAA product with a proper pre-workout ratio of leucine-isoleucine-valine. It can be taken at any time but preferably around the workout time (pre-intra-post). \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability is not great. Price is better than competition. High value product. \n",
      "Definitely not unflavored.  Creates a horrible, sour taste with anything you add it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not recommend\n",
      "I'm assuming the BCAAs are up to par on what the company says so I don't have any comment on that, the problem I have is that this product has zero mixability in liquid.  I don't mean it doesn't mix well, I mean darn near 100% of this product floats on top of the liquid and never mixes.  Since it's also unflavored, it tastes horrible floating there.  Not recommended to buy, IMO.\n",
      "The product does not dissolve in water and it taste like asprin. Opened the container,. used it once and went back to Muscle Pharm.......Total waste of money.\n",
      "Got this free with some protein. I really like this product. I haven't been able to buy enough protein and this has been crucial in keeping my pumps and recovery. If you can afford BCAA's then get this. It is a good price/serving ratio and you get good pumps and recovery.  i take this with creatine, a vasilodator like arginine or niacin, and a shake or light food. \n",
      "I love this product! Call me crazy but since using this I feel like I have seen good gains! I love the unflavored because I can mix it with post workout shakes and not worry about contrasting flavors. I can also mix it with dasani drops and sip throughout the day. Great product dymatize;)\n",
      "This is my go-to choice for a bcaa powder. The price is fantastic and I am happy with the results I have seen while supplementing with this product.\n",
      "I agree with many of the other reviews below-taste is poor, but mixes well with other beverages. Some favorites for me are pineapple juice or crystal light, depending on my nutritional goals at the time. Highly recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be unflavored that ok, I mix it with orange juice for workout. Taken for workout great muscle gain, energy, endurance. Taken at the right times expect awesome results as I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "No flavor but mixes well mix with your favorite drink i usually mix it with my protein shake, pre-workout, or a gatorade, overall great product!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is good for the results but it would be better if Dymatize could produce this same BCAA with flavor. I'm mixing it with juice and it is taking my time to prepare.\n",
      "I give this product an 8. It would have been a 10 if the unflavored product didn't have such a bitter flavor. I mask the bitterness by adding it to my pre-workout and protein shakes. I tried adding it to my morning coffee in hopes that the heat would help dissolve it, but no luck. Since taking the Dymatize BCAA Complex 5050, I find I have more strength and stamina with less soreness in the days following my training sessions. I recommend this product but prepare your self for a not so tasty product. If you purchase this product, add it to your favorite pre-workout or protein shake, or brave the bitterness in just water.\n",
      "It's very bitter, so please plan carefully.\n",
      "Taste a little bit like chalk, good product\n",
      "\n",
      "good product\n",
      "Excellent one. You can mix it with any other supplement. You get excellent quality bcaa in 2:1:1 ratio. Cheaper than flavored bcaa. I don't understand why people give poor rating to the taste. It's unflavored. That's how bcaa tastes. Mix it with your protein shake, pre/post or whatever you like. It works. I recommend it.\n",
      "It tastes horrible, mix with something or a LOT of water. Results have been good.\n",
      "I just put it in water with my creatine and it gives a sort of beefy flavor to the water. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixing it with plain water the mixability and taste both are terrible. No matter how much you stir it or shake it it just seems to sit on the surface of the water, but if you mix it in with a protein shake or a preworkout such as nutrex hemo rage like i do it mixes much better and the taste disappears. For the the price it's a very good product. \n",
      "Dymatize always has affordable prices. The reason why I picked this is up, is because I can add it to whatever my PRE is without messing up the flavor too much. Sometimes i'll add it to my water that has some MIO flavored drops. This is better than buying the flavored BCAAs. You get more value this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, this works for me because I add this unflavored BCCA to my flavored PRE workout drink. unflavored means the more for the value and less other unnecessary ingredients.   \n",
      "Dymatize supplements are my favorite. Overall good quality for the best price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid chiice here. Good boost pre and post workout. The trouble lies in mixing. It doesn't mix well with any liquid by itself. I guess all BCAA powders are this way though. I highly recommend adding a full or half scoop to a protein shake with milk. When its blended with something else you can't taste it. I noticed a difference though. Great for building those muscles back up after breaking them down.\n",
      "I felt very wary about this product, by complaints from those who you had used, but very few supplements really feel much like this, even from the first day that matters ... not completely dissolved, the results are the BCAAs that matter and these are my favorios now.\n",
      "Great and cheap BCAA powder! For people who don't want to overpay for taste and bright box\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is flavorless, So I could not notice it in my protein but sometimes I would just put the powder in my mouth and drink it but that was disgusting. However, I will not rate the product down for that. My biggest pet peve was that it DID NOT mix completly at all. There was ALWAYS white particles that were left over and would not mix up no matter how much I shook it, Therefore I did not like it. The BCAA's themselfs I am sure helped but not quite sure how well. \n",
      "I use this product when i wake up, before and after workouts, as well as before bed. Basically i throw it in my protein shake, and since it is unflavored it has no effect on taste. BCAAs are a cornerstone to your supplementation and need to be taken in consistently, as you can see i make sure i get enough in hahahaha.\n",
      "I recieved this product free with the purchase of Dymatize Whey Protein. It was one of the reasons I first purchased the Protein. I am very concerned with financial as well as physical health. BCAA's are a staple in my routine and I got these to save some money. It says flavorless... totally incorrect. This product has the worst chemical flavor, it is a horrible taste. My usual BCAA is USP labs Modern BCAA 8:1:1. I love the USP product and flavor. I am on deployment and have to do with what I have. To make the Dymatize product palatable I do a half scoop of USP a full scoop of Dymatize and a half scoop of Gatorade for my intra workout replacement. It is the only way I have found to make this bearable. It destroys the flavor of a protein shake or instant Gatorade. I will never purchase this on its own. I will finish it off because I am a firm believer in BCAA's but really wish Dymatize would flavor this. I do not think I can rate this on efficacy because I use it in concert with other products.\n",
      "This has great physical results. Recovery time and muscle gain increase dramatically. It does not dissolve into liquid well at all. Best mixed with a protien shake to make it more tolerable.\n",
      "My first powdered bcaa complex and at first it bothered me that it didn't mix very well or was &quot;absorbed&quot; in my shaker along with my protein and mass gainer, so usually I have to add a little bit more water so that it all goes down and not wasted in the shaker. Other than that it is a part of my supplements. No flavor but I wouldn't take it by itself.\n",
      "I use this during my workouts so that my muscles are getting some good Creatine and working at their optimum. I just did a reordered, so that shows how much I did like the taste and results.\n",
      "Mixes very well...not a powder, it's crystallized so it's much less messy. \n",
      "So far so good and I am excited to continue to take it!\n",
      "Mixes well. Cannot taste them. Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. \n",
      "I bought the 1 kilo of the Creatine. It was a great value. The texture of it is that of fine salt. It has a taste when taken straight I would recomend mixing it. But worth it\n",
      "Product is just ok compared to other brands I have used.  No noticeable gains and maybe a little more bloating.  It is much more granule than its competitors and does not dissolve very well at all.  If you dont like a gritty texture, this one isnt for you.\n",
      "Product mixes well with protein and does not distort the test. Did not notice any bloating with this creatinine product. No significant strength or size gains notices vs not taking a creatine supp\n",
      "Works great to give me that little boost of energy during my workouts and aids in recovery time.\n",
      "Awesome flavor! VERY hydrating!\n",
      "\n",
      "Good creatine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mix it into your protein shake. \n",
      "\n",
      "You won't taste a thing.\n",
      "It's my first time using Creatine, and after I started using, I really feel how muscle keeps like activated. I used mixed with Protein powder. \n",
      "Excellent supplement.\n",
      "Good results and balance between price and quantity, I love this product.\n",
      "Mixes well with protein and does what it's supposed to do. Good price.\n",
      "This has become my absolute favorite creatine. I prefer only creatine monohydrate and this provides all the results you could want at the most efficient price. 10/10 Highly recommend.\n",
      "Good mixability!!\n",
      "I enjoyed this product. I got it as a free sample with my dymatize elite xt and I would buy this product in the future. I noticed the difference in pump and delayed fatigue while taking this. \n",
      "Cheap and mix well. It can be added to any flavored protein since its not flavored. Recommend!\n",
      "The product is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can feel the creatine effects with this product.  I've been taking it post workout with gatorade because \"bro-science\".  I like that it is micronized because that is supposed to help with solubility and absorption.  It tastes exactly like whatever you mix it with...lol.  Only suggestion I have for the company is to include a little $0.05 scooper so i dont have to find my tsp every time i want a scoop.  Overall I'm happy and would buy again.\n",
      "I personally like Dymatize products and this one is another great one. It's pretty simple, it's creatine. One simple ingredient with a 5g recommended dosage amount. I would say it's hard to compare one creatine to another one but you feel the water being retained and you're always drinking water (regardless of brand). I like the packaging size and it does not come with a scoop. The product works as it should giving you good pumps, retains water in the muscles for muscle growth. It receives a 10 for it's functionality. \n",
      "I have no complaints at all. A solid creatine product at a very good price considering you only need 5 grams a day (don't load it). Mixes pretty well with little to no taste. The most bang for you buck. I like to mix 500ml of water with 5g of this 2g sodium bicarbonate (pH buffer) and 10g sugary carbs (Dextrose). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes into my shakes well without leaving a gritty mouth feel. Has no taste and is a good dose. No negatives to mention.\n",
      "I am going to be honest it does not dissolve well in water. It gets the job done but i need to add water twice to fully dissolve And its still gritty. I would recommend getting a different one    \n",
      "1,5-2 months working hard easy and carefree increased weight 20-30 pounds for all muscles. endless energy, and power . trained 3-4 times a week for 2 hours . spent the whole jar . one hour before and after the gym taking 5-10 grams of creatine with protein shakes . for me personally, no side effects. reception starts at 5 grams a day of training . we must take the maximum periods of 1.5 months , take a break for at least 1 month. order a jar of 500 grams. enough to make the necessary breaks from August to January . and it is possible without undue fanaticism ..\n",
      "Very good amount for the price. It does the same thing as every other micronized monohydrate but it cheaper. My main creatine product\n",
      "By far the worst creatine I have ever bought. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. It will not dissolve, even in boiling water and tastes absolutely horrible. If you want to swallow sand on a normal basis than this product is perfect for you.\n",
      "I purchased this product thinking it was a similar product to bb.com's foundation series as it was on backorder.  BB.com a reururn in exchange for their foundation series.  This product is not micronized to a small enough measurement to fully dissolve in water, it has a sand like consistency and in my opinion should not be labeled micronized when compared to The BB.com foundation series which does dissolve in water with a powdered sugar like consistency.  \n",
      "I'd like to give this Creatine product an 8 out 10. 5/5 for its competitive price and 3/5 for its solubility. It's really HARD to mix it with water or juice (12+oz), and may need to mix a 2nd time to finish the whole dose. \n",
      "Started using Dymatize Creatine a few weeks ago pre- and post-workout. I get a nice pump during workouts and have noticed gains from it already. Solid product.\n",
      "I have been very satisfied with this Creatine. I have noticed less water weight since I've switched to this giving me more of the chiseled look I was going for. Also, the gains keep coming. It mixes and tastes fine with my proteins, don't even notice it's there. My only complaint is this is the first power product I've ever bought that didn't come with a scooper. Not sure if they forgot to put one in my container or if it really didn't come with one. Either way it's not that big of a deal. Will purchase again. \n",
      "Overall a great creatine product. Seeing some nice gains already. Taking pre/post workout and once on off days. Mixes well with other supplements. Very satisfied.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this micronized creatine monohydrate after using regular creatine monohydrate for awhile. I really like this product for a few reasons. It mixes so well with a shake or on its own and it's very affordable. Even mixing it with water, it doesn't have a gritty texture and is tasteless. I wish it came with a scoop though. Overall, I'll be purchasing another bottle when I run out and would recommend you to give it a try.  \n",
      "What an amazing creatine supplement. Notice results after my first few weeks of training. This creatine does not give you much bloat after consuming and it mixes really easily with water or juice. I did not creatine load, instead, I just supplemented with two servings after every workout with my protein. Developed some significant muscle and mass and I owe alot of that to this product.\n",
      "Great product at a great price. I was using ON Micronized Creatine Powder before I decided to switch to this. No difference noted, they both taste and do the same thing for you. Very solid product, especially at its price. As with all Creatines, drink lots of water and this product will work wonders for you.\n",
      "It help me a lot\n",
      "\n",
      "This product works very well, I have a longer harder workout.\n",

      "I used a blender ball shaker cup to mix it with whey protein post workout. It mixed well and there were no clumps. I didn't feel or see any gains throughout taking it for 2 months.\n",
      "I've only been using it for about a week now but definitely felt stronger during my last 2 workouts.  I could not get it to mix with anything and the grittiness of it was nearly making me puke. BUT I found a way so that it completely dissolves in water with virtually no taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Mixing tip:\n",
      "Fill a glass with about 6 oz. of HOT water. Use the hottest temperature of your faucet. If your faucet doesn't get very hot, then put the water in the microwave for about 30 seconds or so. It doesn't need to be boiling, but needs to be scalding hot to the touch. Put a tsp (1 serving) of the creatine in and stir for a minute or two until it is completely dissolved. (This won't work with cold water). Then let cool in freezer and drink!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good price, but that's about all it has going for it. Just doesn't dissolve very well, which is a sign of a poor quality creatine. I'm a big fan of creatine in general, but I would look elsewhere for a better quality source.\n",
      "Micronized creatine is the best stuff around for the money IMO, but I can't say that it's entirely flavorless. I gave this (which came free w/ purchase of Elite 7 whey) to a good friend who had never taken creatine and moved on to the best brand in the business, Optimum, and their micronized creatine. Couldn't be happier!\n",
      "This was my first creatine powder and it was amazing. My recovery time shot up and the amount of strength I gain was crazy. Before taking it was wavering around 142-143 and my weight went to 150. My bench press went from 175 1RM to 205 1RM. The only problem I find with it is that I won't really mix well with my protein shake I just take the 5 grams straight into my mouth with juice in there and swallow it down.\n",
      "Dymatize to me makes the best top of the line stuff. And the Creatine by Dymatize is the best creatine for me. It helps me recover and promotes strength and muscle mass. I see changes in myself every week or so. I stack this with Dymatize Gaba and a testosterone booster tribulus. Very highly effective when combined. I take the creatine immediately after a workout. But you gotta drink plenty of water too to stay hydrated. I just love dymatize man. They are the best of the best. I swear by them.\n",
      " Try it for one month and you will see positive results!\n",
      "Very good, I took one of the best, great gains in a short time, my favorite.\n",
      "Does not mix well at all. Out of all the brands that I have tried, this one causes the worst stomach cramping and uncontrollable diarrhea.\n",
      "Excelente, micronizada, se mezcla muy bien con mis batidos de prote&iacute;na...\n",
      "Doesn't mix very well and even for micronized creatine, it has a slight bitter taste in water, but nonetheless it is an effective product. I can't complain.\n",
      " Anyway - creatine as creatine. Worth the $.\n",
      "Awesome powder! Been on it for a month, and have already gained 10 pounds of muscle! I drink a server before and after every workout, and one serving on my off days. Its got a chalky taste, so mixing with water isn't the best. But its results are worth it! Highly recommended!\n",
      " I have always been happy with the quality and price of Dymatize products.\n",
      "I've been using this protein and specifically the Chocolate Fudge flavor for over two (2) years and have been very pleased with the macros, solubility, taste and Informed Choice certification.  The only thing keeping this from a higher rating is the flavor profile seems to have changed since the re branding and packaging.  It still taste good, it's just not quite as good as it was.\n",
      "This is a god protein with decent macros. The reason I rated it a 7 was probably more due to my lactose intolerance, Im good with some wheys and not others, this happens to be one of the not others. If your lactose intolerant I wouldn't recommend it, but if not its a sold whey, I used it with water and it had a good flavor still. Goes great with some post workout breakfast cereal as milk! great value as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great protein powder. Mixes well and tastes amazing. I would highly recommend this to a friend.\n",
      "The flavor was decent, but not always great. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: \n",
      "-Easy to mix with water or milk. \n",
      "-Great results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: -Flavor wasn't as good as other Cafe Mocha\n",
      "\n",
      "Will I buy again? -Yes. \n",
      "Great protein for the price. Tastes great, mixes well in either milk or water, and is priced very well. Rich Chocolate is always a winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dymatize seems to consistently deliver on flavor. Chocolate Cake batter truly does capture that very rich chocolate flavor you remember from childhood when licking the spoon after your mother makes a cake or brownies. Macros are solid as always, little higher than some wheys with 140cal @ 25g protein but 10-20 cals takes a back seat in priority to flavor. Mixes well with both water milk and almond milk. No clumps when mixed with a good shake. Overall very happy and I would rate this one of the better chocolate flavors I have had. They nailed the profile for the description and its a great value price wise also\n",
      "excellent protein I really did notice a different while I was on it. blends easy and doesn't leave any undissolved particles but the taste was not the best. I found the chocolate to be a bit too sweet and had a funny taste to it. but overall I recommend it.\n",
      "wow i cant even decribe how i ove the mocha flavour . the chocolate cake batter is amazing as well. \n",
      "My absolute favorite protein! I love drinking and baking with this product! My current favorite flavor is Snickerdoodle (if you use it to make waffles they taste like Cinnamon eggo waffles) but I've honestly liked every flavor that I've had!--which is almost every flavor!\n",
      "As far as protein powders go, in my opinion this stuff has the best flavor for the best price on bb.com. Chocolate Cake Batter is almost too good to be believed - mix it with plain non-fat Greek yogurt and have yourself a gourmet dessert. Cookies & Cream is the same way and also perfect for fruit and yogurt parfaits and smoothies. It's hard to believe this stuff is protein powder and not actually desert cake mix, I really mean that. As for Cafe Mocha - not bad but I've found it's mostly just good for shakes.\n",
      "The chocolate cake batter is really really really really good. Even when I just mix it with water it's fantastic. At first I thought it would taste just like typical chocolate protein but there is definitely a richer battery flavor. The texture is a little thicker than many others. My favorite way to take it is with almond milk and a few ice cups mixed in the blender. I can't wait to make pacakes with it. Mixing it with yogurt makes actual cake batter. Fantastic for tricking yourself into thinking your having dessert when it's actually a healthy protein serving. I couldn't be happier with Dymatize's protein. It's a small scoop too that packs in the flavoring. 35g scoop brings 25g protein, 1g sugar, 3g carbs. Great stats. I just had a shake for breakfast about twenty minutes ago, but typing this review up makes me want another one. \n",
      "Came within a day. Cookies & Cream flavour with semi skimmed milk was fantastic, really has that oreo taste. Mixes very well in a shaker, no clumps at all. For the protein and amino acids content for me this is great value for money as until now I had been drinking £2 or £3 protein milkshakes from tesco for post workout recovery. Will definitely be trying out other flavours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the only downside was that the scoop was hidden right at the bottom of all the powder.\n",
      "This was my first time trying any chocolate mint flavored protein. I really enjoyed the taste, the mixability, and definitely the quality of this protein. I have also tried Strawberry, Gourmet Vanilla, and Rich Chocolate. Vanilla is not all that great tasting but I still enjoy it. For some reason, Vanilla does not mix well at all. It is one of the worst mixing proteins I have tried personally. Strawberry and Rich Chocolate taste great and mix well. They're not too sweet but have great flavor. They do get a little foamy but I don't mind at all. Dymatize always delivers quality products. Highly recommend it.\n",
      "Very good. Changed from iso thought I would use this on post workout heavy days. The taste is good chocolate fix. I reach for it more often now. I just drink with water but it will be great in a recipe to like truffles or pancakes.\n",
      "Snickerdoodle and Vanilla Cupcake both mix well, and taste is phenomenal. Mainly used these to mix in oatmeal and pancakes :) Will definitely be purchasing again\n",
      "Been takings this for some time as its a gluten-free product. Taste is pretty good, the snickerdoodle has a lingering after taste I could do without, but nothing a few water gulps cant fix. The cookies and creams leaves the cream taste, so be prepared for that. Overall, these are not bad.\n",
      "Fantastic product! Awesome flavor and mixes very easy!\n",
      "Lacked consistency and taste. Did not hold up well. Will not purchase again \n",
      "This was the worse purchase I ever made. This product had a bitter taste and made me frown after tasting it. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy the vanilla cupcake flavor. The full bottle is still in my pantry. \n",
      "Very yummy!! I used this protein powder right after my workouts, mixed great in water or milk. I have to say that I mixed in water most of the time and still tasted great!!\n",
      "love the flavor, tastes like sugar and cinnamon cookie, and the shake is nice and thick with milk just like a desert.\n",
      "It mixes great, no clumps at all, but the taste was so sweet!  I could not make myself drink it. Had to give it away. \n",
      "worst flavour and it doesn't dissolve in water.............\n",
      "I bought this product because it was at a nice price point and and had a high protein quality but the flavor was horrible and had a horrible smell as soon as I opened the package I would not recommend this protein flavor.\n",
      "I buy this stuff in the 10lb box and use it every day. This last box I opened in the beginning of 2014 said it was a new and improved formula. Not sure what they improved but the taste was horrible compared to the old stuff.\n",
      "To me the taste is as important as the results. The results were the same but because of the taste I will be looking for another source of protein. \n",
      "Best tasting protein I've had and has fewer ingredients than most protein powders on the market, making it a cleaner, safer choice.\n",
      "Both flavors were great\n",
      "\n",
      "They taste better than most but are the first protein powders I've bought to turn up without the plastic scoop cup being included. I feel a little angst not knowing what a \"scoop\" is without that plastic cup which has been included with every other type of protein powder I've ever bought. \n",
      "So far to date, I have tried many many brands of protein.  They are mostly pretty similar with some differences.  Elite Rich Chocolate has been my absolute favorite of all time. It actually tastes really really good and I looked forward to every scoop.  Because of how great it was, I decided to try the cake batter because I thought...cake batter...can't go wrong with that.  Well, it's good but not as good as the Rich Chocolate.  The cake batter is too sweet.  Overall, I do feel it provides sufficient protein, low on carbs and fat and good amount of aminos.  I will try the gourmet chocolate next.\n",
      "Amazing taste!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Good whey at amazing price. I am usually a gold standard whey guy but opted for dymatize this time. Coming from the gold standard I will say I liked the dymatize flavour. Chocolate batter is amazing!! The protein is very close to gold standard in terms of texture mixability etc.. However the only thing which I didn't like was the way it's branded. On the box it's written iso whey and concentrate which gives a feel that this iso whey is the 1st component and has a big share in the blend. However if I look at ingredients Iso whey is listed after the whey concentrate and this reflects that it's primarily a whey concentrate and has very less or some amount of Iso-whey. If you look at ingredients of a gold standard whey box it's other way around. iso-whey is the 1st component. I guess that's why it's a gold standard;) will stick to gold standard next time because of this fact. I mean flavour is one thing but I primarily buy my protein for functional reasons and I take no compromise on the quality.\n",
      "I've tried several types and brands of protein,  and I keep coming back to this one.  We all know some brands and flavors you have to feel like you choke them down because of how hag they are to drink,  but this is one where I genuinely enjoy my post workout shake. Will not only enjoy it in the future, will buy more as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy the nutrition your body needs! \n",
      "I ordered the Cafe Mocha flavor. Protein is good quality and does not give me the runs unlike some other cheaper brands. Mixes okay and taste is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: Cafe Mocha is delicious and tastes like mocha. Also has 100mg of caffeine so no coffee needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this stuff!!! \n",
      "The chocolate mint is my favourite flavour. I haven't tried the banana as a shake, I just mix it with Greek yogurt and a table spoon of peanut butter, it's delicious. I mix the cafe mocha into my coffee, it's so good!\n",
      "Loved the chocolate cake batter flavor. This was the first one of this brand that I have bought and I loved it. Would recommend \n",
      "Great protein, mixes well in all things I have tried (Milk, Water, Yogurts & Pudding). Great flavor with good macros. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wife loves the flavor too. \n",
      "Wanted to try something different as I was always buying ON Gold Whey.  I think it does not mix as well but it does the job.  If the price was right I would try this again.  The taste is ok.  I'll stick to ON Gold Whey agai.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great taste and mixes well. Serves all my protein needs.\n",
      "Great product. Taste great mixes well. Blends great with fruits, nuts, butters, or anything else you could imagine. Low cal/carb makes perfect product during shred.\n",
      "Great tasting after workout drink. Excellent for muscle recovery and building lean muscle.\n",
      "great tasting, low fat and good amount of protein per serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is actually great protein. I don't know why it's cheap but I like it. I am going to buy it again.\n",
      "DELICIOUS! I add a scoop to my flax oats with 2 tbls. walnuts, 2 tbls. raisins and a tsp. of honey!  YUMMY way to start my day! Highly recommend! \n",
      "Dymatize is my go to brand for protein powder. All there flavors taste great. Chocolate Cake Batter is my favorite out of all the chocolate choices. But cookies and cream, cinnamon bun are also bomb.I highly recommend all of dymatize's various protein powder blends.\n",
      "Cinnamon Bun flavor is pretty good. Recommend. \n",
      "Dymatize has really nailed it with their new flavors of Whey. Very impressed. Between this and ISO-100 you can't go wrong. This is a staple in my supplements and I don't use any other protein besides Dymatize. Worth the price and investment. Your body will thank you. I use as a snack and post workout. Cake Batter is a BOMB flavor. Great job Dymatize!\n",
      "Love this product!! The new chocolate cake batter flavor is so delicious .It's like having a dessert without the guilt .\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome protein for the money! Loaded with bcaa's glutamine and more. Love the 10lb pack especially when it's 20% off. Mixes great, really nothing bad to say.\n",
      "Mixes well, tastes great; I am honestly enjoying this protein!   I find that it tastes much better as an actual shake (I use water) rather than as sludge or icing.  As usual, the only negative comment I have is related to thickness.  I would prefer it was a much thicker consistency once mixed, but hey, we can't have everything. For a value protein, I'm impressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried most all of the popular protein powders that are sold (Optimum Nutrition, Cellucor, BPI Best Protein), but this flavor (literally) takes the cake! The powder mixes well and doesn't make you feel uneasy. The flavor is sweet but not too over the top for Vanilla Cupcake. It tastes good mixed with Muscletech Casein post workout. I will definitely purchase again, especially because I got it for less than $50 for 5 pounds! \n",
      " Great chocolate taste! Definitely my favorite protein! Looking forward to trying all the new flavors!\n",
      "I use it after my workout...helps with recovery. \n",
      "This is a great product and Dymatize never disappoints you. The chocolate fudge flavour in milk is divine!!!!! Tastes good with water too. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I love about Dymatize in general is that they give a complete picture of the Amino profile in all of their protein products. Other major brands avoid this as it may expose \"spiking\". Dymatize is honest about it and this is one of the things I like about them.\n",
      "Very smooth and easy to blend and drink. I was nervous that the snickerdoodle flavor might be TOO sweet. It's not! It seems to be closer to vanilla to me, but I really like it a lot!\n",
      "I'm sure there are better protein supps out there, but they don't have the value of Dymatize Elite Whey. I've used Universal, ON, and many others, but Dymatize is always the best and flavors are great too. Cinnamon Bun is amazing with only water and so is Cookies & Cream. High quality protein right here.\n",
      "Cookies, Cookies, Cookies and Cream what is wrong with the other team. Nothing, Nothing, Nothing at all they just can't compete with the best of all. Fits perfectly into my upcoming program without the hassle of wasting time for #breakfast prep. Recommend for users who want fitness to fit their lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best tasting Cookie & Cream I ever tasted. Cafe Mocha aswell pretty DAAMMMNNN GOOOD + Got caffeine!\n",
      "Great Protein Powder for the price! Doesn't make you bloated etc like so many others out there! I have definitely noticed increase in muscle gains using it properly ie; waking up in the a.m. pre workout & post workout! Definitely recommend it!\n",
      "This is hands down the best protein I have had since I started back lifting. It mixes great! It tastes great! It is not spiked, and has a great profile! It is my new go to protein!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good chocolate taste has a cocoa taste also really good with water but better with milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dymatize has always been my go to protein, especially for the flavor. \n",
      "Cafe Mocha flavor is UNBELIEVABLE. Best flavor of any whey protein I've ever tried, handsdown. I always look forward to having my protein shake since I got this and will definitely be re-buying. Why bother paying $10 more for Gold Standard when you can get this?\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: Just got the Cinnamon Bun despite the awful flavor rating, and I have to say it isn't that bad. Not something I would drink everyday, but its worth a try in the 2lb tub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glad I spent my money on this whey! Tastes great and mixes with ease. Got the cafe mocha and if you just throw in some ice cubes it tastes just like iced coffee, didn't even feel like I was drinking a protein supplement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've used this brand for several years but its either my water or the protein has changed a bit.  Now, using just tap water, when I mix it up there's a lot of clumping on the surface of my glass.  I just don't remember this much clumping from previous uses.  \n",
      "I still like the taste, low cal and protein though, just wish it didn't clump up so much.\n",
      "Amazing  taste & mixes perfectly. Who needs to drink a coffee from starbucks when u can have this with loads of protein & virtually no sugar. Also the price is fantastic\n",
      "Optimum Nutrition who?  This stuff is the same thing as optimum nutrition but cheaper with far better taste and mixing quality.  You can't go wrong with this protein!  \n",
      "love the chocolate mint. good protein \n",
      "\n",
      "great product and great value for 10lbs. good taste as well. mix with milk for better quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "good protein powder. probably would have enjoyed more if i had tried a different flavor. however, gave me an upset stomach after drinking it while other protein powders dont have this effect on me. solid protein though\n",
      "please add banana to your 10lb list of choices. i am forced to pay the 5lb rate for know, but your product is the best...please please\n",
      "I used to buy a different protein powder. When the company changed the product/ingredients, I had to look for an alternative. Now I buy MusclePharm Combat Whey Protein an Dymatize. Those are my two favourite protein powders regarding ingredients and taste.\n",
      "Plus the prize is pretty good, too.\n",
      "It's protein. Not a lot of fat content which is good. Flavor isn't bad at all. Mixes ok but there's always a small clump. Doesn't smell as bad as others when I forget to rinse it out right after use. Good value for the price\n",
      "Yup - it's a protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mix can be a little rough, but I've been able to mix 2 scoops in either the 20oz or 28oz bottles without too much effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rich Chocolate\" isn't as good as the \"Chocolate Fudge\" flavor - but it's enough to be able to drink it with straight water and zero dread.  I wish could get the fudge flavor in 10lb box form heh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes great. Mixes great.  I like it and I have ordered it plenty of times.  It is in my rotation\n",
      "Best protein on the market in terms of grams protein, BCAA's, calories, fat/carb, and PRICE. There are definitely better proteins that offer zero carbs, zero fat, lower calories, etc., but they're all much more expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of value, you won't find a better 100% whey isolate product on the market. The cafe mocha flavor is awesome, too. The 10 lb bag is the whey to go (pun intended).\n",
      "I have to admit the taste of cookies & cream surprised me. I was very hesitant about buying a flavor that I could not mix with frozen fruit.  Going to be even more daring and purchase chocolate mint. \n",
      "\n",
      "Huge fan of the Dymatize brand, and while I'd prefer their ISO 100, this stuff is great when you're lifting on a tight budget. Blends easy, and the cafe mocha flavor is downright delicious! Plus, I'm about 99.3% sure their plant is in the US, which I know isn't important to everyone, but I value that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried many different proteins (Dymatize Elite, Elite XT, Elite Gourmet, Elite Casein, Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard, Musclepharm, Cellucor, BSN, Bodybuilding.com), and overall I say Dymatize is my favorite for the price.  I really like ON's taste, but there are some fillers and protein spiking ingredients in it that I don't agree with.  Overall, I feel Dymatize Elite is one of the best value proteins.  It has everything I want (except a good Isolate, but they have ISO-100 for that if I ever decide to pay the extra $$).  I buy the other proteins when they are on a good sale, but whenever I have the choice I keep coming back to this protein.   Some of the flavors are a bit nasty in my opinion, so I avoid those (Cinnamon bun was a HUGE disappointment).  I really like the Rich Chocolate and actually look forward to my post-workout shake.  I don't usually like other brands Cookies & Cream, but I really like Dymatize's version.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I HIGHLY recommend Dymatize Elite as a good whey protein.\n",
      "Good protein the taste is alright but you get what you need out of this product. \n",
      "Mixes well and tastes great. \n",
      "this is my go-to protein. great nutrient profile and even better price! all the flavors ive tried are deliscious. butter cream toffee wasnt what i expected, tasted a little watered down no matter how much water i used so you gotta mix with milk, but still not GROSS with water. the vanilla is the BEST vanilla ive ever tried! chocolate is....well its chocolate. cafe mocha is bomb! especially cos it has real coffee/caffeine in it! i think 125mg? i still have some flavors to try but you def cant go wrong with this stuff!\n",
      "Rich Chocolate was the first protein I tried after ON, and was exponentially better-tasting. Cafe Mocha was ok, but not quite as good as Rich Chocolate. Chocolate Fudge tasted about the same as Rich Chocolate, but my only criticism is that, whenever I tried to stir it, not all of the protein would mix with the liquid and some stayed on top as a sort of foam.\n",
      "This is the best tasting protein powder I've ever had.  Mixes great, low carbs, great price...what's not to love?\n",
      "\n",
      "I never go out of my way to write a review but I honestly love this protein. It mixes well and every single flavor tastes great. This is my go to protein and it is very reasonably priced!!!! \n",
      "Loved them.\n",
      "Great price and great taste.\n",
      "Trying different brands right now, but will re-order when it goes on sale. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love Dymatize protein. The flavors are soft which I like. I don't like to drink an intense flavored drink after a workout. The soft flavor also makes it easy to create smoothies. I have purchased the 5 lb. and 10 lb. sizes. I haven't had any negative experiences with this protein. Recommended for anyone. \n",
      "The chocolate mint is hands down my favorite flavor of protein from any brand, with that being said though I don't see as much muscle gain with Dymatize Elite as I have with other proteins I have used. I have started using this protein in combination with another and have had outstanding results.\n",
      "I have tried many brands of protein and I must state the Dymatize Elite Whey Protein in Gourmet Vanilla is AMAZING!  I love the fact that it mixes very easily, contains only 5 grams of carbs, and tastes GREAT by itself.  I have consumed it by itself and blended with fruits/veggies.  No matter how I prepare it, this stuff is fantastic!\n",
      "I love the cafe mocha flavor! Mixes pretty well with very minimal chunks. Just went trough 5lbs of this and am getting more! This is a flavor I won't ever get tired of!\n",
      "Good list of ingredients with few fillers, mixes very easily  and tastes great!\n",
      "The reason for the low rating (2) of the Dymatize Elite 100% Whey Protein, is because the Rich Chocolate flavor is just bad. While it was claimed it was an improved taste, they missed the boat.  The taste was more like a mixture of cookies and cream with bad chocolate thrown in.  Figured I would try the Dymatize and save some money over the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey that I normally buy (10 lbs).  I am going back to the Optimum, as their chocolate flavor is excellent.  I will NEVER again buy the Dymatize product.\n",
      "This is a good protein for the price, mixes well and the taste is good. I recommend the cookies and cream flavor, i tried the gourmet vanilla and was pretty bad tasting. What is great about this protein, is that it has digestive enzymes, so you don't get that feeling of fullness or bloatness like you get from other proteins; at least in my experience. I switch back and fourth from Dymatize or Optimum Nutrition depending on my budget, and they both get the job done. They definitely help with recovery and soreness. \n",
      "The taste was great!  it mixed very easily and was good in whatever I mixed it in; water, milk, soymilk.\n",
      "Taste is good.  Not that strong compare to other Chocolate flavor from other whey protein powders.\n",
      "It's a good whey powder.  \n",
      "Serve its purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its well priced for the Whey Islolate,you are getting!Super clean and also has Glutimine and amino acids for recovery!Strongley recommend it.\n",
      "This still the best protein for the money far and away. \n",
      "Delicious product with great mixability with just a couple of shakes.  Truly one of the best tasting chocolates on the market.  This product along with the ISO100  are fairly priced and truly always in my cabinet.  I will be using my lower calorie ISO100 during my upcoming cut for the Dymatize Challenge.  Everyone should get themselves some for the Challenge you will not be disappointed. \n",
      "Again great product and great price. \n",
      "I've tried a ton of different proteins, including ON 100% Whey and ISO, Combat, Arnold Series, Six Star, and Dymatize.  This is by far the best Chocolate flavor I've ever tasted (used to be an ON double rich guy), great profile, really silty/easy to mix texture, and the price is on point.  I've had the Chocolate Mint, also a solid flavor, but I will definitely be buying this again.\n",
      "For the price and the quality of protein you get along with the Zytrix enzyme matrix, it would be hard to find a better Whey concentrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good whey isolate protein from Dymatize. Not the best tasting chocolate protein, but above average I would say. No mixing problems at all and a bit of a thinner shake if you like that or not, but of course you can always add more or less liquid to tailor it to your preferences. 25g of protein per scoop and good level of BCAAs and glutamine. Good value as well for a whey isolate product. Great overall product from Dymatize.\n",
      "I'm a huge fan of Dymatize, as every powder is low in carbohydrates and offers what I'm looking for in a protein powder: lots of good-tasting protein for a low price. Flavors are excellent, as well. The only one I didn't like was Cafe Mocha of the 7 flavors I've tried.\n",
      "I have used this for years. I got it as a fluke for cheap and honestly never looked back. The chocolate tastes soapy, and as a result I switched to chocolate mint which has since taken over as my favorite flavor. Piña colada and cinnamon bun are also great flavors. The recovery is nice, mixes great, priced great, and tastes great. My whey for the long haul.\n",
      "This is a great product at a good price. I got the rich chocolate in the 10 pound box. This is not the best tasting protein I have ever tried but it is good. I take it with water and milk. The mix ability in water is great no clumps or sticking to the shaker. As for the milk its a little harder to mix leaving some small clumps but just take the extra time to shake it a little longer and it will be fine. I use a blender ball in my shaker cups when I make my shakes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Haven't used long enough to tell about effects of use, but it does mix very well, not lumpy like some, and flavor is good.  If you buy the 5 lbs. price averages out better  than if you buy the 2 lbs. of other brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "excellent product, great taste and very good price!\n",
      "It tasted very good.  I didn't notice much change in my body composition.  I got a discount on this and so I decided to try it.\n",
      "Best tasting and best price for a great product\n",
      "I love the price! BB.com always has the best prices online out of anywhere I can find. With the super fast shipping, you cant beat this deal, overall I love Dymatize's whey! My favorite is the Smooth Banana! You will not regret this\n",
      "\n",
      "Started taking this about 2 months ago when I decided to get more seriously into shape.  Had been working out in limited home gym for 5 months but did not see many gains.  Joined a 24 hour gym 2 months ago and decided to add a supplement at that time. This stuff tastes good in the chocolate . Mixes well in shaker cup.  I've seen gains in the last 2 months but to be honest, I see the best benefits when I drink it before a meal. I'm not nearly as hungry and eat a lot less.  When eating out I am always bringing 1/2 or more home for later. I also use the vanilla for fruit smoothies.  50% OJ and fruit with a full scoop. Mixes and tastes great.  I definitely recommend this to anyone working out or even as an assist for weight loss. \n",
      "\n",
      "I mix it with universal vanilla protein to give it chocolate taste. Delicious and great quality \n",
      "Interesting flavor. I like it. Good whey for the price. I don't think you can find a better deal on whey.\n",
      "good price! but a bit too sweet for me, need to mix with more water\n",
      "YUCK! Cookies & Cream used to be my all time favorite flavor. Unfortunately they recently changed it and the \"new and improved\" flavor is anything but that. It tastes nothing like the old stuff and nothing like cookies & cream. There are definitely worse protein powders out there, but i was really disappointed because this one used to be SO good. I wont be ordering it again. I am waiting for the reviews to start going down as people start tasting the new flavor. So disappointing...\n",
      "Dymatize Elite (the new improved taste one) is my go to cutting whey protein powder. The chocolate mint is my favourite tasting out of every one I have tried. Make sure it's the new formula however, the older ones don't hold up in taste. Great mixability ability and their usually on sale. The gourmet vanilla is good if your mixing with milk, half and halting with another powder or blending it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great tasting protein at a great price.  Cafe Mocha is very tasty and mixes easily, can't complain for under $50 for a 5lbs. tub.  \n",
      "well this is the best protein i have tried very very good,about taste  this is crazy when i was open the pot the smell was horrible i think OMG this is shittt because most of the whey when smell good taste is good but this one smell horrible but the taste OMG is the best  serious!!!!! cafe mocha  flavor simple the BEST!!!!!!!!! NUMBER ONE FLAVOR FOR ME!!!!!!!!!!! WELL DONE DYMATIZE!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good casein. Not as thick as ON. Taste is a bit lacking....liked old taste better.\n",
      "This is a really good protein shake. I prefer Dymatize over ON. \n",
      "The best protein in mixing. Although strawberry and vanilla flavors were amazing, the chocolate flavor was not impressive. I s****est everyone to try Neopolitan Variety Pack. It is 10 lb, and only for $88. If you buy it when BB.com gives 20% off, it becomes $70. There is no deal can beat this.\n",
      "Cookies and Cream is a 10/10 hands down for me. If you make it with enough water (or milk) is is still extremely sweet. Also works with protein pudding. I have also tried and enjoyed some other flavors. Butter Creme Toffee is great for protein pudding; however, I do not like it as a regular shake with water (only milk). Also, there was a time when I was interested in trying a non-chocolate protein powder (stupid idea), but Strawberry Blast was not bad relative to other fruity protein powders. Tip: freeze your protein pudding and it will taste like ice cream. \n",
      "Recipe:\n",
      "3 Scoops Cookies and Cream Dymatize Whey\n",
      "0.5 - 1 cup milk (Skim, 1%, 2%, or whole)\n",
      "1 Tsp Cinnamon\n",
      "2 Tbsp Dark Chocolate Cocoa powder\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "Mix and Freeze\n",

      "Cheapest whey protein I could find in this website, at only $0.67 per serving for the big boy 10lb box.  Awesome stuff, the cafe mocha is my fave.  Walk out of the gym feeling like you're sipping in some Starbucks.\n",
      "So I have had other whey products and to be said it works well. The taste for smooth banana though is not very good. It was interesting at first and now I cringe a little every time I have to use it. It is a really thin shake.\n",
      "I bought this protein as there was a \"buy 2 get 1 free\" deal going on.  To me, whey protein is whey protein, and as long as there is enough protein, and it is inexpensive, I'm down.  Taste is the next factor, which can make/break if I re-buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I had decent expectations for the taste of this protein, as it was pretty cheap.  But, the taste was really good.  I'm used to thicker protein shakes, but this one is pretty thin.  I always add almost double the water than protein powders say, into my blender ball, and I had to adjust to not add much more than it said.  This was actually great, as the drinkability is better than other protein powders I've been used to.  It might be the thinnest and easiest to drink.  But, the flavor was awesome.  The powder itself (chocolate fudge flavor) smelled like brownie batter, and tastes just like it smells.  Since this isn't a thick shake, at least in my opinion, there were zero clumps, and mixed very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing as how there is plenty of protein in each serving, it is inexpensive, and it tastes great, I have zero issues with this product at all.  I may try the other flavors after my 3 tubs of this are gone, but I have no issues with the chocolate fudge flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best Whey Protein I have ever used, broke my sticking point.\n",
      "This protein mixes well. The strawberry blast is pretty similar to ON gold standards delicious strawberry but its a little more mild. I like that it doesn't have red 40 as an ingredient for color (red 40 is bad). I typically use ON gold standard but wanted to try something else and this so far has been just as good and easier on the wallet. I cant say for sure if the product works, that's hard to determine for any supplement but so far this seems like a quality protein at a good price. \n",
      "Great whey protein. Dymatize means you get quality whey with no amino spiking! Also it's at a good price, great taste, and mixes well.\n",
      "Out of all the different brands of protein I have tried, this one by far tastes the best. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried so many Whey Protein shakes and this by far is the best one! I felt like I wasn't dtrinking a whey protein but a dessert! It also dissolved very quickly no lumps at all. This is my new choice for Whey.\n",
      "Great protein for the price! I've been using it for more than a year as an all-purpose whey and have been very happy with the quality, the taste and the results.\n",
      "Personally I decided to buy this product because of the cost which is very affordable since Optimum Gold Standard Whey has increased their price. Compared to taking Gold Standard, Dymatize Elite Whey Protein is completely identical with the Gold Standard with small differences and honestly the flavor is amazing, and this protein does it's job. I would definitely purchase this protein again and you should do because of the great quality and a low priced product\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to companies you can trust, Dymatize and Optimum Nutrition top the list. That said, Elite Whey is hands down the most affordable high quality protein formula on the market. I ordered 3 different flavors; Cookies & Cream, Cinnamon Bun and Chocolate Mint. I enjoyed all of the flavors and all of them mixed well. No side effects whatsoever. Cinnamon Bun is similar to a vanilla with a hint of cinnamon. Cookies & Cream is a good flavor strong enough to identify as cookies and cream but not too strong as to taste artificial. The chocolate mint is a tasty chocolate with a hint of mint. I enjoyed mixing these with almond milk for a creamy shake. The Chocolate Mint was especially good to make protein sludge with and put on rice cakes. \n",
      "Great product. Great taste. Great price. Great BCAA profile...the list just goes on and on. I highly recommend this whey protein.\n",
      "Tastes good and mixes well\n",
      "Lowest calorie per protein per serving in the price range. With the sale it was an even better deal. Chocolate, vanilla, and butter cream toffee flavors are good. I don't like protein shakes creamy, I prefer mine on the diluted watery side for drinking during my workout without gagging. This suits me perfectly. I'll definitely purchase again. \n",
      "Excellent product given its Excellent product given its price. Nothing worse raspiareny from ON. And while significantly cheaper.price. Nothing worse raspiareny from ON.\n",
      "I used to take ON Gold Standard and after switching to this there is no going back.  Amazing price and great quality.  Tastes amazing too.\n",
      "My favorite protein. Great taste and really low carb\n",
      "for a really low price\n",
      "Awesome protein for the lower price!.... but stick to mint chocolate or coffee.... everything else is pretty bad ESPECIALLY VANILLA\n",
      "\n",
      "The vanilla was great for baking with.\n",
      "Vanilla was awesome kinda of creamy but really enjoyed it.I was pretty disappointed with the cinnamon bun though if leaves that whey taste in your mouth like you get from cheaper store brands the vanilla never had that after taste. I have bought the cinnamon bun in their casein protein and that btw is awwwwessssoommmeeee!!!  But unfortunately with the ISO the taste and color of it is completely different I am probably going to migrate back to their vanilla on my next order but other than that they have a pretty good protein powder \n",
      "Good taste and great fill in for coffee. Not big on the caffeine in there but beings this is a whey(fast processing) it does well. Kind of picks me up a bit too much after a workout. Haven't felt a crash from this yet..\n",
      "These two flavors and the protein was one of the best tasting protein that I have every had.  It mixes easily and doesn't leave me with that bloated full feeling.  This is a great protein to buy and use.\n",
      "Switched from ON b/c they went up on there prices. I've had the Dymatize Gourmet before this and it was ok. They Elite 100% protein is great and the cinnamon bun taste great too. I usually get chocolate, but wanted to change. I'm glad i did. I will order this again. \n",
      "\n",
      "great protein ingredients and all but there is no reason for super bland/ watered down tasting protein powder( referring to chocolate fudge, and cafe mocha ).Rich Chocolate is the better tasting of the three and probably the ones i will buy if i stick with this protein. \n",
      "One of the best tasting whey proteins I've had. I'm more on the side of results over taste, but this is too good not too mention. As well it has plenty of Leucine to help muscles grow. \n",
      "Not the best tasting protein, and has a lingering after taste. I did not get the cinnamon bun flavor\n",
      " ;-(.  Very disappointed. \n",
      "It does what its suppose to do and it tastes pretty good in my opinion. I would buy it again.\n",
      "protein and a good taste, thus enough to neutral mix so as milk or juice\n",
      "IRecently just started using Elite 100% Whey for a low carb option. I love the price-to-pound ratio as this is a really good price for a 5lb tub of isolate blend. The Cinnamon Bun flavor smells funky and just tastes ****ght, mixes well but i cant get over the weird smell. Now, the Cookies & Cream is by far my favorite so far! Very smooth and mixes quite well! No Foam or smell! Just the flavor\n",
      "Great taste, cheap, good macros. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been an ON fan for years, but I decided to try Dymatize. Overall, I am impressed! With Dymatize, scoops are bigger and 5-lb tubs have less servings, so you don't really save any money over ON, but WOW! The flavors I've tried are awesome! For reference, I'd give ON extreme milk chocolate a 6 and ON double rich chocolate a 7, so these are REALLY good!\n",
      "\n",
      "mixes very easy. i like to cook and make homemade protein bars with it. taste is pretty good for a whey product!\n",
      "I will keep it short and simple. I like it, and that's why I keep ordering Elite whey protein from Dymatize. Also I need to see information on the label, that I'm looking for and Dymatize has that too.\n",
      "Wow!  The new improved taste is not so good!  I've used this for years and loved it.  It not only works for the muscles but, the taste was great!  One of the main reasons I bought this product was because it tasted so good.  Recently I received a new order and at first I thought maybe I got an outdated or expired product because of the taste.  Then I thought maybe I had spoiled milk(fat free).  So, I tried again and the taste was still lousy!  Any chance of ordering the old recipe?  If not, guess I'll have to go into the testing mode again to find another product.  The new improved better tasting Dymatize sucks!\n",
      "This stuff is SO good in flavor, it feels like you are eating something BAD!! Love it\n",
      "\n",
      "This product taste amazing! It has low fat also\n",
      "Which helps me with my overall goals. I also get the top\n",
      "3 flavors because I love the chocolate side of flavors.\n",
      "Cinnamon is my favorite because it's super cinnamon!\n",
      "I use my magic bullet to blend it which it blends easy.\n",
      "It's not a thick protein. There's only a couple grams\n",
      "Of carbs which is nice also. Very healthy product and\n",

      "Me I did my research. Enjoy guys\n",
      "This protein is my first brand outside of the very popular ON Gold Standard and I'm glad to have taken that step.  The powder mixes and dissolves well in my shakes (almond milk, banana, creatine and occasionally peanut butter or frozen berries) and leaves the shake a bit thicker than the ON brand typically does which I like better.  This also has 100mg caffeine per serving (similar to a cup of coffee) so I only use it in the morning or early afternoon.  I went with cafe mocha flavor which is a nice coffee/chocolate blend that tastes pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "a lot of ***** from this one. It is good for this money, but that's all you get. You get what you pay for REMEMBER. \n",
      "I have been using this for over a year. this is the best bang for the buck! great protein for if you are not wanting to put on weight. \n",
      "God dam it wish i would have known that the Cafe mocha had 100mg of caffeine in it, now  its even harder for me to take a stim break of pre workouts since im taking 100mg of caffeine pre and post workout in shakes :( \n",
      "\n",
      "I use this for my morning protein shake.  This is a great quality, fast absorbing protein which is important first thing in the morning.  It mixes extremely easily in any shaker (even without a mixing screen or ball).  It tastes great mixed only with water.  I don't normally mix it with milk, but I have done it before and it was like drinking a delicious milkshake.  I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Smooth flavor, high in protein. Definitely saw good gains from it. After two 5 lb. jugs of use, I can definitely say I'll continue to use it. \n",
      "What can I say? I really like this flavor. I really like how it blends super well, without any lumps left behind!\n",
      "Protein is more or less protein; this product contains protein and has been my protein shake of choice for a few months now; it is not especially better or worse than other products I've used.  I'm really writing a review just for this flavor, this Cafe Mocha.\n",
      "I want everything in my life to taste like this.  EVERYTHING.  This is without question the best tasting supplement product of any type I have ever used.  Starbucks does not make a cafe mocha that tastes this good.  If you went to a fancy restaurant and paid $10.95 for a dessert that tasted like this, all you'd talk about all week was how great the dessert was and how you want to go back again.  It's that good.  Try it.\n",
      "One of the best flavor I ever tasted if not the best protein I ever tasted. Never get tiered of the taste.\n",
      "I am not a fan of coffee but I wanted to try a different flavor than my usual chocolate or vanilla.  The flavor was a welcome change! Not to mention the added caffeine for my early morning workouts to help me make start my work day with plenty of energy.  It has an excellent nutrient profile and has pretty good mixability.  I would be wary of using this product for those doing night time workouts or those with a very low caffeine tolerance.  Overall great product!\n",
      "This is my first week using a Dymatize Product and I have nothing but good words to say here.  Chocolate Mint is a wonderful flavor if you like mint and the powder mixes really well.  I now use a blender cup and you can't beat that it eliminates the clumps and this powder is so easy to work with too.  I really like this especially for the economical price and great flavor.  I also like that they offer their larger volume protein powders in the same flavors as the 2lb container.  I will be getting a 4lb next probably Cafe Mocha and for sure will get the 10lb going forward.  Thanks Dymatize you have a great product here!!\n",
      " I truly feel full when I drink this and the Chocolate Mint flavor is amazing.  Very happy with this product and I feel like I really got my money's worth for the amount I received.  Way to go Dymatize, this is my new fave!!! I have added the Cafe Mocha to my mornings to help my body think it's that extra cup of coffee ;) Great flavor!\n",
      "Cant beat the price for the quailty of this protein. Sometimes it dont mix to well but you will have that. Best protein for the money.\n",
      "Hi all athletes! Good isolate. Very nice. Price-quality ratio is very good. Packing super. Excellent mixed. I see no reason to buy a more expensive more expensive brands. The quality is not affected. You all good and great pumping. Anton.\n",
      "My first time buying dymatize whey, cookies and cream is poo poo. Not sure if i'll buy a different flavor or not, in the mean time I'll choke down this stuff anyway as I got 5lbs of it. \n",
      "High quality and mixes really well\n",
      "horrible taste smells like cinnamon bun but after drinking hurt my throat\n",
      "I love this protein! I have finally found the one I want to stick with! I can actually taste the coffee and I don't gag while I am trying to drink it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just wanted to let everyone know that the cafe mocha flavor has 100 mg. of caffeine in it. Not sure I would have bought it had I  known this. My preworkout has enough in it  to sustain me through the day. Guess it would be ideal for morning shake before work.\n",
      "This is definitely the best tasting protein I've ever had. And I've compared prices . This is a deal ! Would buy again in a heart beat. \n",
      "\n",
      "I usually don't make reviews for the products that I use however this protein has got to be one of the most tastiest ones I've had in a loooonng time. I also like that fact that there's caffeine in the whey which is a plus with the coffee flavor. \n",
      "Awesome ingredient profile, tastes delicious, and one of my favorite protein products out there. A nice change from optimum gold standard.\n",
      "Good protein powder.  Doesn't mix as easy as some others.  Flavors are ok.\n",
      "This is one product I like especially the flavor.  The protein mixes well and tastes great.\n",
      "Great product. Taste great!!!!! Mixes very good\n",
      "Really good product, mixes well and tastes great would definitely buy this product again.\n",
      "The new and \"improved\" flavor it horrible. The old flavor was great and easy to drink , This flavor i have to choke down each drink and it tastes like cheaper brands i have previously bought. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great product at a great price per serving. Never get any bloating or discomfort after a shake. The Strawberry Blast flavor is good, only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 on flavor is because it does have a slight powdered strawberry taste, not quite like a real fruit taste, but not bad by any means. I liked to blend in a banana with my shakes, and this flavor pairs well with that. The banana flavor definitely has a strong banana scent, but doesn't taste strongly of banana. In my shakes I taste 90% milk 10% banana. I've only tried the new formula so can't comment on before and after. Some reviewers mentioned it doesn't mix well, didn't notice this problem with my Blender bottle or blender. I use vanilla almond milk as my fluid of choice for mixing.\n",
      "HORRIBLE! I been using dymatize for over 3 years now. I loved it. But now the New Improved flavor is so bad I can even stomach it. It tastes horrible going down. But then there are the burps afterwards.  I'm so disappointed. Please go back to your old recipe. I will no longer be a customer of dymatize. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The new vanilla flavor is wretched and will be abandoning Dymatize after being a loyal customer for multiple years.  Why did you change the flavor Dymatize?  WHY!!!????????  It is not too late to fix this great error.  Read the reviews it is not just my opinion. Vanilla=wretched\n",
      "This is one of my favorite proteins and with a great price per serving. I've always shopped around for price per serving, taste, quality ingredients. The taste is good especially if used with milk. I use the Gourmet vanilla since they have more servings per pound. GREAT PRODUCT!\n",
      "\n",
      "Rich Chocolate tastes like crap, I bought the same thing a few months ago it tasted different, so much better. The \"new and improved taste\" is a lie. I'm looking to just give away the 10 pounder I recently purchased because I can't stand the taste. I will never buy this product again.\n",
      "what a great tasting protein!!! mixes so great and if you mix the cinnamon protein with banana and peanut butter you will fall in love!! better than the banana and cookies and cream flavor!\n",
      "While the flavour is not particularly bad, neither is it particularly good.  It has other features that I like, like low carbs and high protein, but the cafe mocha flavour is bland to the point of near tastelessness.  It's unlikely I will purchase this one again, but I might be willing to try other flavours one day.  They can't all be this boring, can they?\n",
      "I had been buying Dymatize Elite 100% whey (Chocolate Fudge) since 2010. Not only was it packed with protein (24-25 grams) and minimal calories, it flat out *tasted great*. I am a chocolate fiend, and this stuff had been so delicious that sometimes I would drink it just because I wanted something chocolatey yet low-calorie. When I first tried mixing it with milk it almost blew my mind -- it was such a delicious chocolate shake. Notice that thus far when describing this product I have been using past-tense. That's because in 2013, Dymatize changed to a \"New & Improved Taste\". All I can say now about this product is that I will no longer buy it again; and thank goodness I only bought the 5-lb container instead of my usual 10-pounder. I struggle just drinking a single scoop (I used to drink 2-2.5 scoops); and after I drink it, I get terrible indigestion, and burps wreaking of this horrible \"new & improved\" flavor. I'm looking forward so badly to finish this container that I've basically looked to dump this off to friends. Luckily my girlfriend is willing to take it off my hands, as she says it just tastes like SlimFast. Ultimately, this product -- with its low-calorie, high-protein content -- will meet your fitness needs. And if you can stomach its taste, then more power to you. But I basically have one word to describe this once-great, updated product: DISGUSTING.\n",
      "Tastes amazing, mixes well. Dymatize is a very reputable company with their third party testing for ingredients, and shining the light on companies who spike their proteins with aminos.\n",
      "Caf� Mocha is a great flavor. With the added caffeine, its a great replacement to my morning coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend! \n",
      "It's your basic whey, and I didn't notice anything that singles it out as a better or worse whey product.  I'm more concerned about the flavor.  Usually, when I read a review that says something about the flavor, I glaze over.  I don't take supplements because they are tasty.  Sometimes they suck, then you down them, then who cares.  I've had my fair share of the normal stuff, and you just kind of get over the taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Cafe Mocha stuff, though.  Wow.  Straight back to ON whey.  I'm surprised I even finished this tub.  I'd describe the taste as something along the lines of \"assballs.\"  I activated my account just to write this.  It's not actually any cheaper than other stuff, anyway.  Check the cost per gram of protein.\n",
      "Mixes well.. Product seems legit... Bought this because it was lab tested by a third party source stating that the nutrient profile is true to claims. Chocolate fudge however tasted terrible and I normally like chocolate flavours.  Cookies n cream was sweet but not really to my liking. Cafe mocha tastes pretty good. 8/10 for price and profile. \n",
      "Best bang-for-your-buck available when it comes to and Isolate.  Great lean gains, low calorie very solid taste.  Doesn't get much better than Dymatize.  \n",
      "Great lean gains. Great protein if you are trying to cut weight. CAFE MOCHA IS THE BEST TASTING PROTEIN EVER. It tastes just like an iced coffee. Rich chocolate tastes fine in water and milk. Avoid smooth banana. The smooth banana smells great but the taste is absolutely awful, did not look forward to drinking it. Clean ingredient profile and a solid value. Mixability was fine and no digestive issues. Aspartame free is a nice touch too.\n",
      "Hands down the best tasting protein I have used.  I have tried so many and based on taste, mixability, cost, number of servings Dymatize is #1 for me.  I have gone through easily 500lbs of Dymatize, working towards a ton!\n",
      "Nice flavor. It is a little hard to mix, but it mixes better than most. I really wish it didn't have sucralose in it. All-in-all I'd buy it again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This actually tastes like piÃ±a colada.  I'm excited to try a higher calorie meal replacement shake with some real pineapple and fat free fro yo.  I tried it with regular mixed frozen fruit and even my 5 and 7 year old wanted seconds!\n",
      "It arrived two days ago as I will use it during the bodybuilding.com body challenge. I bought it for the first time because it is the sponsered product of the contest, but I am so happy that I did as the taste is very satisfying and that alone is a great start to trying to do an 84 day challenge with a product you dont mind drinking. I look forward to the results it helps me to achieve.\n",
      "I have tried the ON Whey proteins and figured I would give this brand a shot since it was on sale in a buy 2 get one free deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein does not mix well with water or milk. At least not as well as the ON brand proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor is ****ght. Looking forward to finishing the cookies and cream though as it is not the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would buy again on sale. I would not buy at full price because of the difficulty mixing this without a blender. In the scooper it seems like the granules of this powder are larger than the ON granules. Might just be my eyes going bad though.\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein is a great balance of 1) taste, 2) protein/calorie and 3) sugar. I also love that it has some BCAAs in it, because I now consume all my BCAAs during my workout.\n",
      "Was excited to try the cookies and cream whey because I loved the cookies and cream casein. Wow, what a disappointment! I wound up needing to mix it with a different protein powder to mask the awful taste. \n",
      "  Good product that gets the job done at an affordable price.  Only reason this product did not receive a 10 is because it takes awhile to stir and mix.\n",
      "I love the cookies & cream, and the cinnamon bun flavor all though im not a big fan of the chocolate mint, its not minty enough...it still taste good tho, so far this is the best tasting protein shake iv had its great! I love the cinimion bun one in raw oats in the morning\n",
      "I had previously purchased Elite 100% Whey Protein in Rich Chocolate in a previous order, prior to the company changing the formula. What I had in that tub of protein convinced me to make a rather large purchase on the Neopolitan - Variety Pack. Little did I know, that throughout the time period when I ordered the Rich Chocolate and the Variety Pack, Dymatize decided to change the formula and made it worse somehow. Rich Chocolate now is very poor tasting and had to escalate the taste issue with BB customer support. They credited me for the Rich Chocolate protein portion. The other two flavors in pack (Strawberry Blast and Gourmet Vanilla) are average tasting and tolerable. Will not be buying again and would not recommend to others.\n",
      "This product does what it you need it to do, which is supplement your daily protein intake or act as a quick meal or meal replacement. The \"new and improved flavor\" is a bit more bland in my opinion, but that is a good thing because it tells me that it is not totally loaded with unnecessary sweeteners; you're providing fuel for your body, not entertainment for your tastebuds! Besides, it tastes great when you add a frozen banana and some peanut butter =)\n",
      "Great taste, mixes quickly and completely in water. Clumps slightly in 2% milk. Awesome in coffee or hot water for a healthier version of hot chocolate. Can be a little pricey but there always is some kind of deal on BB.com.\n",
      "Dymatize is my go-to for whey protein.  The price is right and the taste is one of the top three proteins out there.  MGN and ON are the other two faves of mine.  Dymatize mixes well, tastes great, and works as it should.  The added bonus is that this product is actually gluten free unlike others that say they are and process on machinery with gluten ingredients.  If you want a gluten free protein that tastes great, this is the one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protein is decent and I didn't notice any change in results compared to the ON protein I've been using in the past. Mixes well. Taste is too sweet for the vanilla for my liking. Flavor is good but if your having it everyday it gets too much. \n",
      "Great protein that helps me meet my daily macros. All flavors are a standalone 10 in my book and they're even better when you get creative with them. Knocked off one point because I wish there was more of each. Since it's a variety pack it would have been better to bump it up to 15 lbs total (5 lbs per).\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein manufacturer has the best balance between quality and price per pound. I intend to stick with it for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "My protein intake has been inline with Dr. Jim Stoppani's Shortcut to Size and Shred programs. Dymatize Elite has played its part perfectly. Couldn't want more in a Whey protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good whey protein.  I'm surprised the strawberry blast was only rated a 7.4?  It was really good, the taste was also slightly better than ON strawberry but then again slightly diff (hence the blast).\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes fine, not powdery like Phase8 (which I also use).\n",
      "\n",
      "Good stuff. \n",
      "I've used dymatize before and enjoyed the taste and gains. This time around I gave the chocolate mint a try. Let me tell you...if I could give this a negative score I would. By far the worst tasting I've ever had in 7 years. Dymatize good, chocolate mint horrible! \n",
      "Protein is protein right? Not exactly in my opinion. I was a long user of ON Gold Standard but the taste just got unbearable. I have tried two flavors of Dymatize and they blow ON out the water. That alone has switched me over to team Dymatize. Not to mention how great the price is for the same amount of protein! Can't beat it at all my next protein up will be ISO-100!\n",
      "Excellent product, definitely buying this again. Banana flavor is terrible with water but mixed with milk it's tastes good.\n",
      "A+ product. Taste very good.\n",
      "Great product! Love the taste! \n",
      "Flavor: decent for WHEY protein. Whey always tastes kinda gross to me, but this is probably one of, if not THE best tasting whey I have ever had. That is not saying that the taste is AMAZING when compared to all foods/sweets, but its great for a whey.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought it because the 10lb. container has great macros, and a greta price per serving. I was already super impressed by Dymatized Elite Mass Gainer (double chocolate,) so I figured why not give them a shot with the whey.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, it's protein, its not magic. it cannot undo a bad diet or poor gym work ethic - but for a protein, it's my #1... esp. when it's on cyber monday sale ;]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to preface my review by stating that flavor was the sole factor in deeming this product as the worst whey protein I have ever purchased. Nutritionally, Dynamize brand is great and offers a solid amino acid profile and protein quality. However, the Cinnamon Bun flavor tastes nothing like a cinnamon roll, or anything remotely close to one. The flavor tastes like old milk with a dash of cinnamon. Unless that description appeals to you, I would steer clear of this flavor. \n",
      "The cinnabun flavor doesn't tats very good, but cafe mocha and chocolate mint are awesome. The best choice for whey if you want good quality protein that also tastes good!\n",
      "Still believe this is the best protein you can get value wise even thought the new changed formula, which I don't find to be that big of a deal. The Cinnamon Bun flavor is fantastic. smells great and taste great. Excellent for protein pancakes.\n",
      "I hate the flavor change! I just ordered 10lbs not realizing they \"improved\" the flavor. It tastes just like the fudge flavor. The original rich chocolate tasted like nesquick.... very disappointed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Really disappointed by the so-called New Improved Taste Cafe Mocha... much too strong coffee flavor, and please note that according to the ingredients list, it has ADDED CAFFEINE, not just real coffee for flavoring. Had I known, I would never have purchased this product.  There are white hard chalky particles that settle at the bottom of my mixer - with a bitter chemical taste, unlike anything I have tasted before (i.e. does not taste like BCAAs or any other protein product I know). I hope they are the added caffeine, because I take them out using a fine meshed sieve!!  It seems to me there has been a decrease in quality with these new versions of the product... I have been using Dymatize Elite for a few years now, but dont intend to purchase this product again.  Sorry Dymatize, but this long-time customer is not a  happy one!!  Bring back my good old chocolatey Cafe Mocha and drop the extra caffeine!!\n",
      "mixes easily in shaker. good taste with both the cafe mocha and choc. fudge although I would rank the choc. a better tasting flavor over the mocha\n",
      "This product is highly underrated. It gives you fast absorption and paired with a scoop of Casein it is the perfect blend of slow release and fast release protein. If you need a cost effective protein that tastes phenomenal I would recommend this. I usually took it with low-fat milk. If you take this after a heavy lifting day it won't help a great amount because it is a whey isolate and your muscles witheat through it quickly. \n",
      "Mixes well.  I am not the biggest chocolate fan but the fiance is so thats why i got it.  I gave it a 6.  She likes the flavor though\n",
      "Honestly, do not buy this. It tastes like cardboard. Maybe it's because of the \"improved taste\", I have no idea, but it really tastes just plain awful. It mixes pretty well but no matter what you mix it with, it still tastes terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously. It may be cheap, but it's cheap for a reason. Go buy some Optimum Nutrition Whey.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought the 10 pound box of Neapolitan (129 servings). It came in 3 flavors (rated above). Each in their individual zip lock bag. I'm quite impressed with the BCAA blend, low price and taste. The Rich Chocolate tastes like chocolate milk, Gourmet Vanilla tastes like McDonalds vanilla ice cream and Strawberry Blast tastes like a standard strawberry protein shake.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome Taste, mixes great. Love it and I have been using it for a bit. Would recommend without a second thought. Buying more NOW!!!!\n",
      "Tastes like vanilla cake, best flavor Dymatize yet!\n",
      "Love the taste, and love the low calories!! Great product would definitely recommend!    \n",
      "Best protein so far.. Taste is really good. Most imporant, just 160 calories and 25 gm protein. It wont effect ur belly fat. I tried universal before which was having 650 calories which was making me fat and bulky from stomach\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty loyal customer when it comes to dymatize whey. I love the amino acid profile, flavor, and it mixes very well even with almond milk. I have tried a handful of flavors and I keep going back to Rich Chocolate. This product will not disappoint you, buy it.\n",
      "I like the flavor of the Cafe Mocha before the change\n",
      "Gourmet Vanilla is by far the best one, I use to throw a scoop of that into some greek yogurt with some nuts as breakfast, it gives me the boost I need for starting the day with a good mood. Chocolate Fudge is also very good, it mixes instantly and tastes great, especially with milk. Cookies and Cream flavour is not as good as I was thinking, it's quite a strange taste...and it doesn't mixes so good.\n",
      "Overall: I'll give a positive rating for sure, as I'm already seeing significant improvements in overall strenght and stamina only after 2 weeks.\n",
      "Very good taste and it dissolves very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been through 2 10 pound boxes of this protein. It tastes great with water alone, mixes easily and at 86.99 for 10 pounds that's pretty hard to beat. With the ingredients, taste, and price I would say it's the best but for whey right now. \n",
      "Flavor is okay. Its definitely better than others I've tried. I feel like it was overall effective, but i do feel I would need to try it for a longer period of time to fully reap the benefits.\n",
      "My first time trying this product was after the \"New Improved Taste\" came about and I think it tastes fine with water. I bought the 10lbs box for 86.99$ which I think is a pretty stellar price for what you get. I love how this product not only has 25g of protein per serving, but it also has 5.5g BCAA & 4g Glutamine, and is Gluten free. This product is a 3 in 1, no need to buy additional BCAAs & Glutamine. I highly recommend.\n",
      "Just opened and tried the New Improved Flavor for the Rich Chocolate.  I just finished a 5# container of the Rich Chocolate prior to the flavor change.  I much prefer the older formula's flavor.  This new one just does not taste good to me.  \n",
      "I can assure everyone that this is in fact protein powder. As to the flavor, it is AMAZING. I've only tried a few other flavors/brands, but I will try to stick with dymatize for now on. I got three 2lb jugs for a buy two get one free special. The cafe mocha was pretty good but a little flavorless (at least compared to the other two), it's still great though. The \"mocha\" flavor is barely there though. The cookies and cream flavor is amazing, it tastes like an ice cream milk shake. It tastes so good that I'm suspicious that it is even protein. The cinnamon bun flavor is really good as well of course. It tastes like there is real cinnamon in it.\n",
      "Truly one of the best tasting protein suipplements I have tried - and I have tried quite a few. I actually look forward to the cafe mocha w/co****, soy, or almond mike and some ice - better and cheaper and less bad stuff than Starbucks frappachino.  Mixes easily, no clumping or swallowing dry wads of powder.  Good stuff - try it and you will see.\n",
      "love it. its gluten free, easy on the stomache and its super tasty!!\n",
      "I am a long time user of Dymatize Elite Whey, favorite flavor being chocolate fudge. I usually mix with water and it is very satisfying post-workout. However, on my most recent purchase, I noticed that Dymatize had reworked their flavor claiming a \"new and improved flavor\". It may have been new but the flavor was far from improved. Using the same amount of water and protein, it gave a water chocolate milk consistency and flavor. I was very disappointed and wish that they would return to their previous recipe. I replaced with ON Gold although I must say the flavor is only marginally better...\n",
      "While not the best tasting product, the price-to-nutrition value is pretty good, and this earns Elite Whey a 7 out of 10. \n",
      "\n",
      "First tried Elite whey back in June, and it must have been just before they changed their flavor. The \"new and improved flavor\" isn't as good as before, and what sucks is I bought five pounds of the stuff thinking it was the same as what I had a few months ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "If flavor/texture/aftertaste are non-issues to you, and you want a good nutritional bang for your buck, this is for you. If, however, you don't like choking down your post workout shake, try something else. I'll be going back to Cellucor's whey after this.\n",
      "This is a great protein , taste is good but you cannot beat the price of it ! Try it you will not be dissapointed\n",
      "Dymatize has certainly made improvements in the taste section. I have been using Dymatize Elite Whey consistently for over an year now and just got my new order for a couple of months, and I can certainly feel the difference in the taste. It's great to see that now Dymatize Whey is not only economical and effective, but also great tasting. \n",
      "\n",
      "I get bored of flavors easily and have a hard time finding flavors I like that can be mixed with water and not be hard to drink. Strawberry blast mixed with water tastes like nesquik strawberry milk ( I loved that as a kid) I was really skeptical to get a fruit flavor because I had really high hopes for banana in 2 other brands. I would recommend strawberry and cafÃ© mocha. CafÃ© mocha is delicious in the morning with hot water. I just hope I don't get bored of these flavors. \n",
      "Great protein powder for a great price. Cafe Mocha is the best flavor of protein I've had. I like the fact that there is caffeine in it, it makes it the perfect protein for the mornings or any time in the day that you need a little boost. \n",
      "Probably the best set of macros you'll find for the (regular) price of any whey powder.  Taste leaves a bit to be desired.\n",
      "I NEVER like cookies and cream flavor, however I received a sample with my order so I figured \"why not?\" it was delicious! Smooth, easy to mix, overall delicious. \n",
      "This is the replacement for their whey protein isolate they used to have. It is the same price without the isolate now, has more of the bad stuff you don't want carbs etc with less of the quality too.\n",
      "You are being sold a lesser product for the same price now.\n",
      "New improved flavor .... I would argue that too it is nowhere near the product it was.\n",
      "I have bought this for a long time previous sadly will look elsewhere now. Dymatize had a great product at a great price that meant it was the forerunner amongst its rivals every time now run of the mill.\n",
      "a sad day Dymatize.\n",
      "i had bought this protein like 3 times and it had an amazing taste, and now with the new improved formula i feel i need to add more scoops to contemplate the old taste.used to mix 2 scoops and had rich taste now i need like 4 for the same old taste.dispointed\n",
      "New order of Dymatize Elite 100% Whey Protein just came in, the new Rich Chocolate tastes even better than the old Elite Whey Protein Isolate series one!\n",
      "Love this company, love their protein. Great product, at a fair price. Helps me supply my daily protein intake, at a relatively small calorie intake. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I've used this company's product for the last 6 years. \"New improved taste\"is not good and does not mix well. Time to switch brands. Bummed.\n",
      "I've been buying this for years now  and thought I found my lifetime favorite protein until the \"New and improved\" formula came out, If they don't revert back, then this is the last purchase they'll have from me.\n",
      "I personally liked this protein, the taste is absolutely amazing for most of them, price for quality it's a pretty good protein\n",
      "Product tasty, and great quality! ... For money excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish i could afford a strictly whey protein isolate, but the budget of having a family of 5 leaves little room for expenditures.  I am not the expert on proteins or am i a bodybuilder.  I do notice the weight loss is harder on this protein.  And the mass building seems a little more.  but i could just be a fool.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I do enjoy the chocolate mint more than the cafe mocha.  but still miss the Isoflex Peanut butter and chocolate chips. \n",
      "I have used Dymatize protein since 2006 and recommended it to everyone.  Now, with the \"New Improved Taste\" out, I hate it.  The taste has changed and is  not as good as before and it does not mix we'll.  I would not buy this product until they switch back to the unimproved formula, there are plenty of better protein powders out there.\n",
      "Great price, Mixes very well with water, and I don't have a problem with digestion. The butter cream toffee just tastes awful. It's not bad at all when blended with fruit in a shake. but by itself with water is not good.\n",
      "Does not tell you on the label that there is 100mg of caffeine, I am sensitive to caffeine now I'm having trouble sleeping the last few nights till,I looked on the label. But online label doesn't tell you there's 100 mg of caffeine.\n",
      "This used to be my favorite protein but since they messed with it to create their \"new and improved taste\" I've become very disappointed in this product.  It is terrible, tastes like cheap Wal-Mart brand protein.  Switching back to ON once I finish this crap.\n",
      "\n",
      "cafe mocha is beyond my expectation! best taste so far!\n",
      "This is the best tasting whey I've tried, it mixes really well, and has a smooth flavor that blends well with other foods.  Doesn't lump-up in your shaker either.\n",
      "Great taste. Nice price\n",
      "Have used this product for along time. Part of the reason I continued to use it was because it tasted different than other brands but now the new formula is just like the others. Too strong of vanilla taste in my opinion. Especially when it's mixed to make protein pancakes, etc.  \n",
      "This is the perfect whey to have if you drink a shake in the morning. Tastes great. The combo of caffeine and coffee flavor is a perfect \"wake me upper.\" I do recommend buying a different flavor as well for pre/post workout. Especially if you mix it with different tasting ingredients.\n",
      "'New improved' taste is absolutely horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will look for a new whey protein option.\n",
      "DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY CAFE MOCHA.  This protein has 100mg of caffeine per scoop.  Avoid cafÃ© mocha at all costs. Save yourself some money, caffeine withdrawals, and time.  Barely used my 90 dollar 10 pound tub and had to throw it away because 2 scoops of protein would keep me up for hours on end each night.  \n",
      "\n",
      "ohh and did i forgot to mention to stay away from CAFE MOCHA?\n",
      "Best Taste ever! Mixes perfect with 500ml milk\n",
      "best protein i had!\n",
      "ONLY DYMATIZE!\n",
      "I never write reviews but I felt I had to try to keep others from making the same mistake I did by buying this product. If you care about taste don't bother with this flavor, if this is a \"new improved taste\" I would have hated to taste what it was like beforehand. Pretty disappointed in Dymatize but hopefully they'll step it up as this protein is a very good deal but needs a better tasting product before I'll buy ever again.\n",
      "I love Dymatize's whey protein.  Their flavors are great and the product is the best deal you can get for 100% isolates.  I've tried every flavor and love some of them and a few others were tolerable, but that cookies and cream was something I didn't look forward to post-workout.  My advice is to just stay away from that flavor, or mix it with some peanut butter and banana... option number one is the smartest way though. \n",
      "this was my favorite flavor.  The new and improved flavor sucks!  Go back to the orignal.  I will finish this 5lbs tub and switch brands.  Not happy about the change.\n",
      "Its great protein, but if you cant stand to drink it why bother.  For the record I  mix with 0% milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gourmet Vanilla taste absolutely horrible!  This has been my go to for a while, not anymore.  Improved taste is false advertising.  Now I have 5lbs of this stuff. ï  How can you receive any benefit if you canât swallow it?  \n",
      "Don't be fooled for overpriced protein's, claiming they will make you look like Mr.Olympia. This protein is for me the best bang for your buck\n",
      "Best whey protein i've used so far. Mixes very well and taste great!\n",
      "TASTE RATINGS ONLY\n",
      "This was my go-to protein for quite a while. Unfortunately they reformulated the blend and the taste and consistency now are absolutely horrible. 5 rating for value and ingredient profile but I will never purchase this stuff again.\n",
      "I ordered 2 x 10 lbs bags of the rich chocolate flavor because it had a good taste to it in the past. This time however, I was extremely disappointed with the taste. I did not realize that this protein had a \"new and improved taste.\" The rich chocolate flavor now taste like chocolate malt and is not at all like how it before they \"improved\" it. It really tastes bad and now I am stuck with 2 x 10lb bags of it. I used to love using the rich chocolate flavor protein with my oatmeal in the morning but this stuff is really not good. I repeat, this stuff tastes like chocolate malt. If you like chocolate malt, then maybe this stuff is for you.\n",
      "First Dymatize product I bought and was NOT dissapointed!  Cinnamon Bun Flavor Tastes just simply AMAZING!!!\n",
      "one of the best whey protein out there. tastes great and mixes really well\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, the protein from Dymatize is fine. Was using the ISO-100, which didn't taste great (sort of like Yoo-hoo), but this one tastes pretty weird. I haven't had it with milk, but with water, and coffee, it tasted pretty bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only whey protein i use exclusively, best price per serving, gluten free, and it mixes perfect and the flavors are incredible. I couldn't recommend  this product more to anyone looking for a protein supplement. \n",
      "This is, hands down, one of my favorite whey protein powders. I love anything this brand puts out, but this flavor is excellent. I use it everyday and have no complaints. \n",
      "I have used this product for years. I have 2 shakes a day all consisting of Dymatize Elite Whey Gourmet Vanilla. I considered it as the best protein powder ever. I recommended it to friends and training clients. Even provided samples for them to try. All this has very recently changed as Dymatize has elected to change the formula in some way. It no longer has that great taste I loved. Additionally it now causes stomach distress and discomfort. I'm very disappointed with the change and now have to find a new powdered protein. Very Sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "This company makes many great products, and their protein powders mix quite easily. They also offer many low sodium flavors which is nice. I have tried various flavors of this, and have yet to be disappointed. Its an excellent go to source of whey that is still affordable.\n",
      "love this protein, mixes really well! great product for the price!\n",
      "This stuff I pretty good. I like the flavor, I usually go for vanilla for powders because even if it not that good it still taste descent. This vanilla is good but very easy to water down. It defiantly mixes really well with just about anything. \n",
      "I mix it in with one of my multi-protein powders to increase the amount of whey-isolate and concentrate in my after workout shake\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a good protein powder.\n",
      "Great overall protein powder. Mixes well, tastes great ( Havent gotten the \"Improved version yet). Has a great nutrition profile. One of the better proteins ive used, Kind of concerned with the increasing negative reviews i am seeing now..Would break my heart ot see this get ruined. Part of the reason i came to dymatizes protein was i couldnt stand ON's flavors.\n",
      "The best whey protein i had this far in my life. Mixes perfectly like a milkshake. Try the chocolate fudge, it is delicious!\n",
      "I dont know why people are ******** about the flavor. It tastes amazing for me\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect amount of BCAA and protein with few carbs make this perfect for my pre-contest diet. The fact that it taste great gives me something to look forward to with my current diet. Love the product. \n",
      "The new improved flavor is a success. I thought the old was good but the new is definitely an improvement...winning!\n",
      "the old rich chocolate flavor was my favorite whey protein...I would rate that 10/10...so when they discontinued that and put out this \"new and improved\" version, I was skeptical. But still i gave it a try and bought 2 tubs...boy was this disappointing! Boo Dymatize! for killing what used to be a good product...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If I'm not mistaken, the previous version had good reviews too...which was well deserved! Just makes you wonder..what the hell happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed that they took out \"Isolate\"....so is this now mostly concentrate?\n",
      "\n",
      "To Bodybuilding.com: I think it would be a misrepresentation and misleading/deceptive to continue to associate the good reviews of the previous product  to this new one ..which is totally different. Please reset the reviews so that the new product won't get misrepresented by the high reviews of the previous one.\n",
      "WTF?! I ordered a 10lbs Cafe Mocha protein powder only to find that the drink I've loved and been using for several years has changed!?! And it sucks on top of that!!! Why would they do that?? Bodybuilding.com users gave it the highest rating out of all the other flavors. New and Improved my ***! I guess I'm going to have to find another brand...\n",
      "\n",
      "Tried the produce because of the flavor range, doesn't mix well And the flavor is nothing special at... If anything really lacking. Will not buy again \n",
      "The taste can be dealt with. The 156 servings is what really got me.\n",
      "So far my favorite protein I have had. I was using ON which worked as a protein but never mixed well and didn't taste all that good. I gave this a try and boy I was amazed on how well it mixes even with just water and the taste. I actually look forward to having my protein shake now lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "This used to be my favorite protein supplement. I don't know what happened if I ended up with a bad batch, but the last tub I bought didn't mix well or taste great.\n",

      "\n",
      "I first tryed this with just water and it tasted fine, the next day I mixed it with milk, ice cubes, and half a frozen banada and WOW!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have only tried Chocolate fudge and I will be buying it again, I also enjoy Iso Sensations but wanted to try something a little cheaper. If you are on a budget this is a great protien. As for how it works I dont know, but I have found all the protiens I have tried in the past couple years have all worked the same so. \n",
      "\n",
      "I gave this protien a rating of 10 because its price and taste, and I will be buying it again. Yummy \n",
      "\n",
      "not bad for the price, but awful taste. Thought it might just be the choc mint, but ordered rich choc and tasted of the same chemical blend as the other. Spend the extra ten bucks and get bsn isolate\n",
      "love it !!\n",
      "Tried dymatize in cafe mocha flavor for the first time and was blown away. The flavor is amazing, it doesnt have that distinguishable whey taste and texture that the majority of protein supplements have. If you closely compare the nutritional profile of this product and Optimum Nutritions Gold Standard you'll find them to be similar enough to where its personal preference. i use to only buy ON, but from now on i'll be going between the two no doubt. Great mix-ability. Standard packaging. Worth a try at the very least since it saves a few bucks from ON Gold Standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability 8/10 - Price 8/10 - Contents 8/10.  The only thing I wasn't happy with is the taste.  The rich chocolate tasted pretty chalky and bitter.  But it isn't horrible, I can drink it no problem, just not the best tasting product I've used.  The price is great, the contents are perfect for my needs.  And I am pretty confident using dymatize products.  I recommend it.  I use it for post-workout and it gives me exactly what I need, when I need it, for a very very reasonable price. \n",
      " easy mix\n",
      "I loved the cookies and creme but Im burnt out on that flavor and I lost about 13 lbs while using it for breask and a snack. Order the 10 lbs varitey Very disappointed that I could not request my own flavors and the flavor they sent were chocolate and vanilla...\n",
      "This is a wonderful protein. Mixes well, (20-30 seconds with a mix mesh for me) tastes good, the whey isolate is a quick acting protein, making it a great post workout option. It's not loaded with much else. That makes this a very affordable protein option. Don't expect this to be your only product, but you get plenty of BCAA's and protein for a cheap price. If you want to get huge, look at other proteins packed with extras, but if you want a very good basic protein, enjoy. I think Dymatize is a  straight forward company. Go with Chocolate Fudge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hands down my favorite protein powder. Taste is phenomenal. Powder mixes well with milk and water and digests easily. Cafe mocha is the only flavor I've tried so I can't vouch for the other flavors, but this I truly the nectar of the gods.\n",
      "Great &amp;amp; cheap protein isolate.\n",
      "Best Whey Protein I have ever had.The flavor is delicious and the mixability couldnt be better.Props to Dymatize!\n",
      "Some people say that protein powder is protein no matter what , but I Don't think so, this protein taste so so with milk but with water taste like old pepto bismol and gave me a lot of gas and diarrhea kill my stomach I think this company use low quality protein. I will not buy it again there`s too many better choices on the market.\n",
      "nice and cheap\n",
      "Great product, plus it tastes amazing. Totally recommend it.\n",
      "I have tried many different protein powders and have found this protein to be unbeatable! I will admit Iso Sensation is still my absolute favorite, but the price is way to high. For the price, you will not find a better tasting, mixing and performing protein out there!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "the best tasting protine ive every had\n",
      "Will stick with chocolate mint from now on. The berry blast flavor is horrible! I'm a fan of strawberry flavored proteins. But this stuff has a terrible artificial flavor.\n",
      "High quality. Good ratio of protein per scoop in a relatively small scoop. It's just whey isolate so the ingredient profile is lacking compared to some blends, but it is still my favorite protein powder. Mixes perfectly and is very thin, which I like. Taste is good.\n",
      "Taste is pretty good, but theres something missing that I can't quite put my finger on. Mixes great. Only downside (could be good for you) is that its pretty thin in consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality: The Best you can tell not by it just being isolate and concentrate blend but by how fine this protein is. It is like sand.\n",
      "Mixability: Is like nothing I've seen before, you can poor it into a glass of water and is immediately begins dissolving before you stir or shake it. Never had any clumps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Flavor of this is far from the best. It is not bad by any means but nothing special here. The flavor is Def the downfall of this product. The fact that the label has per 100 grams of protein on the label amino acid profile instead of per scoop is misleading as well. Still good product though.\n",
      "Gourmet Chocolate:\n",
      "\n",
      "I like this ISO because it mixes very well, so you can just down it right on the spot. I mix it with water right after a workout and it's not gritty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor: It's surprisingly light in flavor. It's not chalky, but it's not also super sweet. The taste is of chocolate is very faint and light. This makes it super easy to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it mixes so well and the flavor is so light.. I don't use a lot of water to mix it. so it does go down easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "After taking it post workout, i'll still have a small meal/snack around 30 mins after the protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this because it was really affordable compared to 5 lbs of protein at GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, etc. This is by far my favorite Brand and Flavor. It's super lean, a bunch of servings, and delicious! It tastes amazing with milk of course compared to water but it's great either way. I like Vanilla because I can mix it into fruit smoothies and stuff. I got my ex girlfriend hooked on this stuff. I wouldn't give it a perfect 10 but I highly recommend. It's one of the best tasting vanilla proteins I've tried.\n",
      "This product has really helped me in getting closer to my goals in gaining great size and strength. It fits my budget perfectly and the amount of protein a serving contains is great. The product also tastes great and I have no complaints at all!!\n",
      "Great protein supplement. But their GOURMET VANILLA SUCKS! For some reason it makes me feel disgusted after drinking it. \n",
      "Flavor, mixability, smoothness, BCAA's, low carb, 0 sugars, it has everything! Couldn't ask for a better protein powder! Have tried others and nothing compares!\n",
      " This is the protein I primarily use. It is cheaper than ON gold, has a great profile, decent flavor and great mixability. Plus it is primarily whey isolates. It has digestive enzymes which is great. Hasn't let me down after several tubs.\n",
      "A very good protein powder for the price.   This is whey protein Isolate that sells for the same or lower price than other brands of whey concentrate.   It also has more servings for the $.   \n",
      "\n",
      "The Rich Chocolate flavor was good, and mixes well.   I also tried the Vanilla, but though the flavor was a little weak.   I'll be sticking to the Chocolate.    \n",
      "This is a solid protein with a great nutritional profile. Really good for anytime when you want to increase protein intake. Great for pre and post workout nutrition as it is fast enough. Great taste on the Rich Chocolate and the Cafe Mocha.\n",
      "I have been taking this for almost 2 years now and I am very satisfied with this protein powder. The price is definitely reasonable, and I prefer whey isolate since I lift within an hour after taking this. It mixes very well with both water and milk (low-fat or whole).\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't mix as well as other protein powders like ON's.. taste is okay\n",
      "Honestly I bought the product because of the price point it's selling at compared to ON and the other top selling brands. I wasn't looking for anything fancy, just a good quality protein with low calories. I was pleasantly surprised by this product, its consistency was that of sugar and it mixed very nicely, and it also had a great taste. I had shakes with just water and couldn't be more pleased. The chocolate mint was right up my alley. Rich chocolate was somewhat less tasty than the mint, but it was still good. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future. Been my go to whey for about 6 months now.\n",
      "Takes a little bit longer to mix with water than the ON Whey (like 10 extra seconds lol) but the flavor tastes better than the ON Whey double chocolate mixed with water\n",
      " Overall: i love this flavor it has a great profile and the price is reasonable fair. my go toprotein\n",
      "Been using this product for over a year now and it is great for supplementing my diet whether I want to bulk up or get leaner. Highly recommend\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great tasting protein, mixed easily with milk or water. \n",
      "This product tastes good but I would not buy it again because it doesn't mix well. I use this in a shaker bottle with skim milk and it leaves clumps of dry protein in it. It might work well in a mixer but I am trying to save time and clean up.\n",
      "Tastes good. Mixes well. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very lean protein powder.  But it is the worst tasting protien I've ever bought.\n",
      "\n",
      "NASTY! This stuff is so gross - I don't care what kind of ingredients it has if it tastes bad its not worth it! \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the best Protein powders I have ever tried. It mixes well with no clumps. The Cafe Mocha is outstanding in taste. I will defiantly buy again and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality Whey Protein powder.\n",

      "\n",
      "Price: One of the best deals on this website when it comes to good quality isolates. 10/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability: This is the reason I didn't give the product a 10, it mixes well for the most part but occasionally leaves grains or smudges on my shaker bottle. 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: Chocolate Fudge was a pretty delicious flavor, even somewhat thick with water which I love. It isn't the purest chocolate flavor I've had but it's definitely good. 9/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients/Nutrition: Pretty awesome makeup; low carb but still maintains a  low sodium content. Can't complain about the aminos nor BCAA's either!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "worst tasting protien powder ever works fine for cooking but as for just having a shake it tastes awful gonna stick with the cafe mocha flavor from now on\n",
      "I love this product, and so does the entire family. I add the vanilla powder to my morning coffee to have a vanilla latte every day for breakfast. The trick is to add just enough water or milk to mix the powder into a paste before adding the hot coffee. If you do not pre-mix, then clumps will form and you may have to scrape them off with a spoon before you drink.\n",
      "\n",

      "I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Berry Blast tastes like strawberry nesquik!\n",
      "ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS with skim milk. Pretty good with 6-8 ounces of water too. It tastes just like a coffee coolatta when you add a couple ice cubes. It mixes VERY easily as well. 20 seconds in a shaker cup and you're good to go!\n",
      "My everyday Whey.\n",
      "Good quaility isolate at a good price. I used it on keto diet with no problems. Tastes wonderful with almond milk and some stevia while on a contest diet especially the chocolate fudge.\n",
      "Horrible taste\n",
      "\n",
      "got the rich chocolate, its a good protein source, low cal for high protein and at least some BCAA's in there, only complain that I probably could have known beforehand if i read more thoroughly is that is came in a bag..cheap ziploc..but I kept and old 5lb container that works perfectly to hold just over half \n",

      "Almost 80 servings of whey isolate for $45? Awesome deal! Taste is pretty good mixed with water. Chocolate fudge is much better than the smooth banana flavor.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite brand. Their protein series are awesome. They are valuable. I highly recommend their product for start.\n",
      "best protein for money. i have switched from ON to this on. Dont regret. Best protein for price.\n",
      "The Vanilla flavor was amazing! I'm very sensitive to \"sugary\" and \"milkshake\" flavors. They usually make me feel sick and sit heavy in my stomach. This vanilla was so refreshing and light. My favorite vanilla I've tried. The shake was very easy to mix and convenient for after workout.\n",
      "I've taken both Optimum whey and Dymatize whey, and both do a fine job, with Dymatize a bit cheaper, so that's what I've been using. See great results with both. I really like the Cafe Mocha flavor, and the chocolate mint is very tasty, as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "good product for the price but would buy a different flavour in the future. \n",
      "I LOVE Dymatize protein!  In my opinion, they're the best in every category in terms of price and ingredient profile.  The flavors, however, are hit and miss.  Chocolate mint tastes just like Andes mints melted down.  The powder is smooth and blends great in a shaker cup without any clumps if you don't use really cold water.  Having tried a few tubs of ON Gold Standard, I would definitely recommend this instead.  I've had a few banana flavored proteins and this had the most bland chemical taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great value, great amount of servings, and the product is amazing all around but the taste was not that special, I began to mix it with cinnamon so that it would taste like something. I would defiantly buy it again especially if i'm short of money\n",
      "My favorite flavor I've tried yet.\n",
      "I love the Cafe Mocha flavour! I am a 16 year old female, and I have tried many different protein powders, and so far this is definitely my favourite! I mix 1 scoop with about 8oz. of water, and its awesome for post-workout. I have also mixed it with some Vanilla Soy, Chocolate Soy and Skim Milk, which is also good, but I find its just as good mixed with water. \n",
      "bought this product because barthelfitness recommended it. its a great powder, super fine whey isolate. DO NOT get GOURMET VANILLA!!!! its nasty! iv'e had other vanilla flavors from different companies but man is this one nasty! i bought it so i could blend in apples or other fruit PW but i'm having a hard time getting it down! i mix water, powder, creatine, and an apple today and almost puked trying to finish it! i don't know if it was the creatine or the nasty powder but i do not recommend getting vanilla, go with a top rated chocolate flavor! now ive got 70  servings to choke down for 2.5 months -_-\n",

      "Great product! No complaints about this whey protein. Great taste and and solid results. It also seems to blend more quickly and more evenly than other protein powder I've had. Only takes a few shakes and it's completely mixed with water. Great stuff!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this protein. It mixes great and has a great texture. I feel like i'm getting descent results from it. The berry blast flavor tastes almost exactly like strawberry nes quik. Its a great price and overall exceptional product.\n",
      "Love the Berry Blast, I mix it with soy milk or rice milk and it tastes so good.  At first I got the ten serving size so that I can try it for cheaper, and I fell in love with it and got the larger size.  It's lite on calories, has glutamine and BCAA's and tastes great.  I love Dymatize!\n",
      "Great protein that is low on carbs, and has a high protein to grams ratio.  Perfect for those that are looking to gain muscle mass, but keep excess carbs off.  Not one of the more sugary proteins either, but through my experience, its the supplements who don't use the sweeteners too much that give you the best results.  Great product, and great brand, that will give you great results\n",
      "\n",
      "Great tasing and can see the results. mixes real smooth so its not a hassle. I dont mind having this everyday\n",
      "Taste is awesome. Mixes instantly. Overall great. (Not so good in oatmeal)\n",
      "Best protein I have ever used! Always had to use milk before this protein and can finally drink with water! Such a great taste and mixes better than anything out there. All around amazing protein!\n",
      "****ght, just like you I was on this page trying to see what this product was all about and if It could compare to any other protein powder out there. First off, don't judge this product by the reviews that say It's chalky, It's no **** chocolate milkshake from McDonalds but it definitely doesn't taste like chalk. I got the variety pack just to mix things up because I usually go with Chocolate protein powder. This product tasted good, and was NOT HARD TO DOWN whatsoever. If you wanted a chocolate milkshake you should have gone fast food. THIS IS A PROTEIN SHAKE to all the complainers. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product and it is VERY WORTH the price that you're paying. Plus, Alot of amino acids which is great. Buy it! \n",
      " I like to mix a scoop of this with a scoop of the bodybuilding.com brand casein along with 60 grams of dextrose for my post-workout shake and consume immediately when I'm done lifting.\n",
      "This has been the best protein for me because I have a sensitive stomach but I've had no problems. On the other hand it tastes like dirt litterally\n",
      "My first mistake was ordering the Cafe Mocha for this protein. I do not like coffee but i decided to try it out. The flavor is great if you like coffee and actually has instant coffee in the ingrediants which will add some caffeine. The product mixes well and has a pretty good AA/BCAA rating. The price is also pretty good compared to ON. However, The amino acid content on the back is very decieving in the fact that it is per 100 grams of protein, which is 1/4 the serving size. Even though, it still has good quality whey and I saw pretty lean gains while using dymatized. I will buy this product and other Dymatized proteins again.\n",
      "pretty good tastes just like coffee...cheap price and lots of protein for an isolate. low carb and low fats and tastes good! ima give this a high rating\n",
      "Low calories with 24grams of protein, good stats and it does the trick, good for the price. It tastes exactly like Pina Colada, which if you're addicted to the flavor you're going to love this. But for anyone else the taste will get boring, after a few times I was already beginning to tire of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This flavor is really good. It's sweet and does not haven bad after taste at all. It mixes pretty good in A shaker cup.\n",
      "This is my protein of choice. With Whey protein you get the most bang for you buck in terms of % of protein being absorbed. This brand tastes amazing and I've been using it for about 2 years now. I take it before and after i workout for its quick acting properties. Not only does it taste good, the price is very reasonable!\n",
      " Now because of this one product, I've steered away from Dymatize.\n",
      "Great clean protein. Great BCAA profile. Price not bad. Very drinkable. I use between meals to get my protein requirements. Clean and light so I don't feel bloated after I drink it.\n",
      " Little disapointed with the taste. But that's ok provided it's a whey isolate.\n",
      "Add this to protein or a shake that could use some &quot;berry&quot;... Not for bulking\n",
      "Love this product. One of the best proteins I have utilized. Mixes well with water or milk, tastes best with milk but still not bad with water. I have seen impressive gains since I started using this product, I am in a bulking phase and have 4 shakes a day with milk, have packed on 10 solid lbs. Coupled with other basic supplements and a solid workout routine it is great. Cafe Mocha is my least favorite flavor, but still alright has acutal instant coffee grounds in it. Mint Chocolate with milk and a touch of sugar is like a desert from 31 flavors. Smooth Banana and Rich Chocolate are also great. I am deployed with the Navy and bought 6 months worth of supplements, I took the risk on 30 lbs of Dymatize proteins. So happy that I did. I have found my protein source.\n",
      " This flavor tends to get foamy when first mixed, so I usually premix and let it sit a while before drinking. Then, I just gently swirl it to remix the toffee bits that settle on the bottom of my shaker.\n",
      "Its ok, not what i expected but it was ok, the taste isnt really to die for but the protein contents pretty good\n",
      "Mixes better than other Dymatize proteins I've had and doesn't taste bad.\n",
      "Dymatize has been the first company that I have tried a pure protein isolate from. I decided to give it a go since it was a 5lb for 49.99 which is usually what you'd pay for 5lbs of standard whey protein. This product has not severed me wrong, as I continue to use it post workout and have been having phenomenal results to my physique compared to using just whey as a post workout. You can almost feel the difference in absorption rate. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to a friend!\n",
      "Great and Iso protein.\n",
      "This is a protien powder that works well and is low in carbs and fat so it's ideal for contest prep. The problem I had with it is that it tasted really bad. I tried chocolate, mint chocolate, and banana but all of them had the same nasty taste. It may have been better if I mixed it with milk but I was in contest prep mode so I didn't have that chance.\n",
      "Holy **** this stuff is good. When I first opened the container it smelt so good that I just wanted to get a spoon and start eating. I have used several flavors so far and every last one of them was excellent but the Chocolate Mint is by far my favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best protein mix I have found, dissolves well in milk or water, no artificial sweeteners, and best coffee flavor with real coffee!\n",
      "I really liked the fact that i got 3 different flavors, each one didnt really taste that amazing, but all 3 taste just fine and im very happy with this product\n",
      "I like this product, i switched to it recently, i like it's available in a 10lb bag...so that i won't have to order every 2 weeks...it lasts me 4 weeks+ and i consume about 40-60g a day...tastes light, doesn't attack your taste buds.\n",
      " It's not the cheapest, but it's the best for me, I'll probably only buy this protein powder from now on :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought the chocolate fudge in the 2 lb size and really like the taste. First protein supplement I've used in about 25 years, but looking to boost muscle and recovery.\n",
      "Love the fact that you can great a variety of flavors. Good clean protein\n",
      "Great Product,Great Taste!,and can't beat the price! Been using Dymatize for awhile now also bought the 10 lb box for variety of flavor. It's low in calories, carbs, fats, 24 g protein and most importanlty LOW CHOLESTEROL which is what you should look for also if want a quality whey protein. I also was not looking to gain any weight, and this is the way to go.The lower the cholesterol the better.. this has only 15g compared to alot of others which much higher. It also has all those great aminos you look for in a protein isolate. Thanks Bodybuilding.com for carrying all the best products and great prices and your continous great service!\n",
      " CONS: dont mix that well and doesnt taste great.\n",
      "I've been using Dymatize as my whey isolate for a good while now and I must say I am impressed with their protein. The first thing that caught my eye on Dymatize was at the time a relatively cheap isolate with a lot of servings so I decided to give it a try. I've tried smooth banana, rich chocolate, and chocolate mint flavors. The flavors are all pretty good, but even better when mixed with milk. I like Dymatize and have grown to trust their whey isolate product; I strongly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an affordable, quality whey isolate.\n",
      "this is a great produce, and the taste is even better! mixes well in milk and water!\n",
      " Ice to preference (you can use less ice if you let the coffee cool)\n",
      " Wife likes berry as well and she hates almost every protein shake.\n",
      "Best protein powder I've tried. It mixes into drinks well. It shows great results when paired with consistent training as far as muscle mass, strength, and vascularity. And amazingly actually it tastes great. Pairing this with high glycemic carbs is crucial, but for a high glycemic protein this is at the top of my list.\n",
      "This is one of my favorites so far! Smells and tastes great! It's not too chocolaty with just a hint of mint. I really enjoy the taste, nice change from plain chocolate. It mixes great with water, no clumps or foam.\n",
      "Ok mixability, terrible taste. Not looking forward to finishing this tub. The chocolate fudge tastes much better.\n",
      " An excellent price point for a high quality whey protein!\n",
      "Berry Blast tastes amazing mixed with OJ. I use it as my recovery drink after P90X. Also, feels like it keeps me from eating too much at dinner.\n",
      "Taste compared to other dymatize = 7/10. It has a kind of chemical after taste.  Its saving grace is its price, and that it mixes really well in milk/water.\n",
      "Good product but I prefer Optimum Nutrition. The taste and recovery is not as great ON but it is a bit cheaper. Still, provided for a nice change-up and will probably use again in the future. Dymatize also gets 5 points for putting the scooper in an easy-to-find place and not burying it in the powser\n",
      "Optimum Nutrition has been the standard of protein powder for quite a while now. Their brand of products have been a long favorite of mine, however the taste does not come up to par with Dymatize's Elite Whey Protein Isolate. Dymatize's whey have a very distinct and strong flavor to them, so be wise about choosing your flavor(s). It does not have the &quot;sketchy&quot; chemical taste that comes from ON's products. Also, it smells amazing if that interests anyone out there. Overall, Dymatize has won my opinion as the top protein powder available. Thanks for reading.\n",
      "Great taste and mixability. Fat content is kinda high at 2g but everything else is great, highly recommended!\n",
      " I'd definitely recommend this product, brand, and flavor.\n",
      "Great price, has a VERY high amount of BCAA's and branch amino acids (more than most proteins by far), tastes fine\n",
      "It dissolves good on water, digests easy and rapidly absorbed by the body as well. I am satisfied with this product, specially since it is very affordable. I do recommend it.\n",
      "This protein was a great taste, although it is not very strong, and mixes excellently in skimmed milk. It has been quite useful in my cutting diet, as it has got low calories. Also, the relation cost-quantity is great!\n",
      "Great macros, flavor, mixability and price. Overall amazing product!\n",
      "I've been on this stuff for about two weeks and I love it. No bloat and low in cholesterol. The amino acid profile is impressive too. Maybe it's just me but I found no difference in taste when mixed in water or milk. However, if you mix it green tea you won't be disappointed!\n",
      "This is prob my #1. great value for your money. does the job, easy on my sensitive tummy. great for any cut.\n",
      "great protein no bloat or stomach issues very refreshing mix with orange gatorade powder pwo taste awesome!\n",
      " So it's not that it's bad, it's just basically unflavoured. Given this experience I'm not sure I will buy another Dymatize protein, and if I do it will definitely be 2lb and not 5lb.\n",
      "Great mixability, great taste, good product.\n",
      "It's a very decent protein on it's own. When you add that to the fact that it is one of the cheapest you can find, that makes it a hands down 10! (excellent).Not quite as tasty as optimum gold standard,but close.I mixed it with water in a cheap shaker and it mixed great in about 10 seconds.I would definately recommend and buy again.\n",
      "Just started using it and I can tell you, it taste great.  With less cholesterol, fat, sugar than other whey proteins.  I would highly recommend it.\n",
      "I simply love this product. I have tired their gourmet before with whey and casein mix and it was awesome in Chocolate. So I bought the Cafe mocha whey isolate and i have to say the taste is amazing ( it taste like a desert) and it mixes great. All for a GREAT Price. Try this stuff, you won't be sorry.\n",
      "Excellent Protein Powder! Tried hundreds and this in my Definitely in my top 5\n",
      "The first time I opened this I could smell it across the room. It smells so good, so I though if it smelled that good then it has to taste good. So I took my first serving and BAM! it was good. I love this taste of this mixed with a little peanut butter. Its almost like I am cheating on my diet. This also has a good bit of ammino acids and at 24g of pritien per serving and 35$ per pound, it is one of the best protiens on the market. I forgot to mention it mixes in anything. I mixed it in just a plain water bottle, crappy shake and in some oats. Very fine powder and easily disolves very easily.\n",
      "See my review on the Cafe Mocha for how I feel about Elite (which is positive). But, I tried a different flavor and was disappointed. In water this one doesn't taste so hot..had to use milk. I recommend Elite, but not the rich chocolate flavor.\n",
      "Mixes great, tastes great.  For the money this is the best whey i have ever used.\n",
      "I like this protein.  Tastes good, mixes well, pretty good profile being 24grams a scoop.  It's not an overpowering coffee/mocha taste....what I find tastes the best is 1 scoop of this with a scoop of chocolate flavored protein also.  Good stuff.\n",
      "I bought this product after comparing the ingredients to the first whey protein product I started taking 3 months prior, Pro Performance 100% Whey Protein banana cream. This product has higher content, but it definitely tastes much worse! I can barely swallow it if I mix with water, but mixing with juice or vanilla soy milk helps a lot. I suppose it makes sense that sense that it doesn't taste good since it has a better ratio of useful ingredients to other things like sugar. I was building lean muscle with the other product and I have not noticed any negative difference regarding muscle with this product, so I would say it's at least doing its job.\n",
      "Love the taste, mixability is really good, much better than ON 100% whey, great protein.\n",
      "This is my favourite flavour! Dymatize protein is the best tasting and the best priced protein out there. And its nutritional content is superb for precontest dieting.\n",
      "Very good protein powder. Mixes very well with milk of water. I used milk a lot and for two scoops only required about 10 ounces of milk. So I could put it down quick and have the protein in me. Taste was pretty good got old real quick. Extremely high in protein, Elite Complex had 55g before the milk. Overall really good protein.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Best protein powder I've tried by far. I find a lot of whey powders seem to have a bit of a sour milk taste, can make you feel bloated, and/or leave you spending to much time on the toilet. This doesn't have any of those problems. It mixes good in 6-8 ounces of basically any liquid you would ever think of using, I even used a few coffee creamers in a pinch once. It's does not get overly thick or chalky, and the favors are what you would expect them to be. Chocolate has a cold swiss miss thing going on, vanilla is kind of like a vanilla frosty you let sit around for a little while. Would highly recommend both flavors and the product as a whole. The small amount of liquid required to mix the product makes it great for getting some protein in quick following a workout, while still allowing room for an actual meal.\n",
      "Great product. But I was fooled by the rating on the Orange flavor didn't like it at all. The worse part is that I was so confident that it will taste good so I went ahead and bought the 4 Pound jar. I guess I'll have to suffer through it and go back to the chocolate flavor. \n",
      "Excellent taste for a protein supplement.  I have used this product for the past three years.\n",
      "I was very excited to get this protein when I saw the almost perfect 9.9 taste rating.  An orange flavored protein sounded perfect, but.... not this one.  I did the buy 2 - get one free offer, thinking I'd want to drink the stuff every day.  It's not a bad tasting protein, but not one that makes me want to go back for more.  Wish I could just send back the other 2 for something else!\n",
      "\n",
      "Update -- I am editing my taste review on this one... apparently the first bucket was not as \"orangey\" as the 2nd and 3rd.  I still won't be buying this flavor again, but it's not as bad as I originally thought.\n",
      "I tried Dymatize's elite fusion because I was already pretty confident based on their other products, that this shake would not disappoint, and it did not. \n",
      "I am not even suprised. It tastes good, does what it says, and once again, IT TASTES GOOD. \n",
      "Worst Protein Shake i have ever bought. The taste wasn't totally horrible but not my favorite at all. The worst part about it is that it won't blend in a shaker cup or in the blender. Every time i try to drink it these little white balls in their its disgusting \n",
      "Dymatize isn't a flashy brand. They don't have that cool of a container. The taste of Fusion 7 is pretty **** good but there are definitely better, like BSN Syntha-6...but if you look at the actual ingredients you'll see that they really focus on a comprehensive blend of proteins for true fast-medium-slow digestion. Most other brands that offer blended proteins are almost all whey. As far as I can see, Dymatize is the closest to Pro Jym, which is the gold-standard of protein blends as far as I'm concerned, but at a more reasonable price. This makes Dymatize Fusion really hard to beat. Great product and a favorite for me in protein blends. \n",
      "I first ordered banana smoothie and swear it tasted and smelled like a banana runt hard candy. I read through reviews and orange dreamsicle was raved about to highly that I had to try it. It definitely did not disappoint!! Its the perfect amount of sweetness and tastes just like the ice cream!! HIGHLY recommend. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start off by saying that the Orange dreamsicle is the most delicious tasting protein drink I have ever tasted. It tastes just like a creamsicle. The strawberry banana flavor is awesome but for me personally leaves an artificial banana taste after drinking it sometimes. Nothing overpowering though. The strawberry is also delicious, light and not strong at all. I enjoy that it has fiber, CLA, and B vitamins and have noticed an improvement in my appetite. For all you eager to buy but worried about the orange flavor the rating speaks for itself. My go to protein from here on out and you can't beat the price and BB's fast shipping!\n",
      "Once a leading brand went up in price, I found this comparable. Line up the ingredients with other brands and you'll find a great value. Mixes great. Don't be afraid of the Strawberry and Banana Strawberry - delicious!!  \n",
      "Took this before bed just to get in some extra protein before I hit the sheets and it was good. The orange dreamsicle tasted great just like an orange creamsicle ice cream. The CnC on the other hand tasted pretty bad, a little chalky, but then again CnC flavors usually disappoint.\n",
      "Just ordered this protein powder, and it really has surpassed my expectations in taste. The chocolate peanut butter flavor rocks, and there is no aftertaste. So yum with coffee and ice! Cannot wait to try the other flavors. Highly recommended. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried and use the vanilla,orange, banana flavors and love them. They all taste fantastic. Great stuff !!!!  \n",
      "Great protein product great taste work fast I definitely recommend it.\n",
      "Just started using this because I was looking for a protein system that offers both a fast digestion and quick protein spike plus a longer time release.  Mixability is excellent even in cold water and taste is among the best I've tried.  Price is reasonable too.  \n",
      "They is the best protein powder that I've tried and I've tried a few. It mixes well in milk, doesn't have the gritty chalky takes like the other I've tried. I either drink it early in the morning or before bed. Major thumbs up for helping me crub my appetite.\n",
      "This is my go to protein. I have tried many of the flavors but cappuccino rush is my favorite. It is great as a meal replacement. \n",
      "Absolute best tasting protein I have ever had!  I use it in my morning smoothie with mango, banana, and almond milk and can't get enough of it!  Great product and value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well they did it again!! This is fantastic!! And of course i tried it in my oatmeal and its better than the ISO100 fudge brownie. Absolutely delucious and mixes perfect and no digestive issues at all. I think it will be a great long term addition to my regiment! \n",
      "Seriously the most delicious protein I've had. I was skeptical because vanilla proteins are usually a litle funky and bland to me, but the vanilla shake tastes just like melted vanilla ice cream whether it is in milk or water. It also keeps me full and is perfect for inbetween meals or when I don't feel like eating breakfast. My only complaint is the carbs are a little higher than I'd like, but I haven't found it to be too much of an issue. \n",
      "Cappuccino Rush is simply amazing.  I crave it!  Just be careful not to drink it before bed.  I wasn't thinking when I first started using it, and was consuming it as a bedtime dessert/snack.  I couldn't figure out why I was staring at the ceiling all night, unable to keep my eyes from popping open.  Usually I'm a pretty smart guy, but not this time.  It took a couple of days before it occurred to me that it probably has real coffee in it, which it does.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vanilla is pretty darn good, too, though my girlfriend prefers Lean Pro 8.  I think the Fusion 7 tastes and mixes better; plus, I think that its nutritional properties are slightly better than the Lean Pro 8.\n",
      "After a work out i drink my protein and feel how my muscles absorb the protein and don't wake up sore cause of its bcaas it contains....i realy love this product....the taste is amazing!!!!....it tastes like a product from Starbucks!!!.....i seen good results from this brand!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste great will purchase again.\n",
      "Orange dreamsicle most delicious protein I ever tasted. Mixes well in just shaker cup i use. Good stuff. Highly recommend\n",
      "The flavor is absolutely amazing. One of the most unique protein powder flavors you'll have and it honestly tastes exactly like an orange dreamsicle. Mixes great too with anything: milk, water, or Greek yogurt protein fluff. \n",
      "The best tasting flavor I've ever experienced in a protein powder!  It's my new morning Orange Juice replacement.  Perfectly smooth, mixes easily and helps me meet my daily marco goals!  Excellent Job Dymatize you won me over!!!\n",
      "A great product, with 7 different protein types.\n",
      "The best tasting protein I have ever tasted, plus mixes very well.\n",
      "I have 3 boys ages 20, 18, 16 whom, all love it.\n",
      "Try it you will like it guaranteed! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste great! \n",
      "Orange dreamsicle is honestly the best protein shake I have ever had in my life. Very tasty, I like the blend of protein as it keeps me full throughout the morning (I use it as breakfast with a piece of fruit) or during a workout. Goes well with water or anything i tried mixing it with. I have seen some gains in  muscle mass but I also take a different shake after workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is great  . Looks like a great combo of proteins. Will definitely try different  flavors as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orange dreamsicle is probably one of the best protein powders I've had. Literally tastes like a melted orange creamsicle, wasn't really a fan of the cappuccino rush though.\n",
      "It is Gluten Free and blends to a \"chunky free' smoothness.\n",
      "XLNT for meal replacement\n",
      "Best tasting protein powder I have ever tried.  Highly recommend this product.\n",
      "This is hands down the best tasting powder I've tried yet!\n",
      "This protein tastes AMAZING...I drink it in the morning with milk and its very enjoyable. It almost tastes like a dessert and it gives me protein throughout the morning. Definitely the best flavor I've had for a morning protein. \n",
      "This is a great product.  I have used this flavor and also the rich chocolate.  I am a chocolate lover so the rich chocolate is one I prefer.  The results are great and the taste is also really good.  I use Almond Milk and 4 pieces of ice and Ninja it up!  Great protein shake.  \n",
      "This stuff tastes amazing. The previous comment that cookies and cream tastes like and Oreo dunked in milk is 100% spot on. I like the flavor and macro profile of this better than the combat powder. Just ordered another tub because it won't last long. \n",
      "I love this protein because it blends easily, it has all the different kinds of protein blends which allow you to take any time of the day. It taste great and I am not just saying this because I love Dymatize products!\n",
      "Now this flavor is AWESOME! I just wish their other proteins came in this flavor\n",
      "Just ordered this flavor recently. I can say without a doubt, this is the BEST TASTING PROTEIN POWDER I HAVE EVER HAD (Cappuccino Rush). It is amazing. Tried it first with almond milk, mixes perfectly, no clumps, no sticking, just good smooth, slightly thick protein shake, which I really like. The cappuccino rush flavor tastes alot like the cappuccino you would get from a gas station or convenience store. The added caffeine is a plus as well. The protein blend works great as an MRP. Will be ordering more very soon.\n",
      "This stuff taste awesome! It'ts not too sweet and that was a big plus for me. It realy taste like cappucino. It was a little gritty, maybe I didnt shake it up enough but it's tolerable. I was told it is thicker than the Iso-100 but it wasn't bad at all. It kept me full about 3 hours and gave me a little kick in the morning. I will definitely buy this again. \n",
      "So I've been using dymatize elite 7 off and on for about the last two years. Not many bad things to say about this product, except the \"improved taste\" has definitely changed the flavor of cookies and cream I fell in love with. Ready to buy a couple more tubs and try the cappuccino rush. \n",
      "Just received the cookies & cream flavor and it is great.  Mixed it with plain water and it literally tasted like an oreo that was melted in milk.  Before this I used the orange dreamsicle which was great also.  Aside from the taste, this stuff works well, especially during a cutting phase when you want to stay satiated a little longer and preserve as much muscle as possible. Great product overall\n",
      "\n",
      "Tried chocolate and vanilla, and wow they are horrible. I'll never order these again.\n",
      "good product but has a lot of stuff other then protein in it. This flavor in particular even has caffeine added. Sometimes i really like that but other times its annoying. you def need another protein on hand so ur not up all night..\n",
      "Picked up three tubs back when this was buy two get one free ( Chocolate, Cookies and Cream, Cappuciono Rush). Chocolate is ok, its not the best. I'd have to say Cookies and cream/cappuccino are the two best flavors I've ever tasted out of any brand. The first protein shake I would drink just for the taste. I am ordering more. This left me feeling full for much longer than just whey, probably because its a blend and that's what I was hoping for while I cut. \n",
      "I don't even like Orange but this stuff is great!\n",
      "\n",

      "The taste is subtle but definitely orange but not in the weird fruit juice you would expect. It really does taste like a creamsicle, i've yet to try it with milk but i'm really looking forward to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would definitely buy this again\n",
      "\n",
      "I also tried the Banana smoothie mix and just like before the powder mixes really well but the flavor is what you would expect synthetic banana to taste like. It wasn't as good as the orange but its certainly drinkable\n",
      "Good protein nutrition fact , flavor is good but I feel with rich is very very thick ... My problem is the protein stuck in the shaker and not easy as gold standard to mix .     \n",
      "Great Product, Great taste by itself or making shake with it. \"Need to get this again\".\n",
      "This is an amazing product! It has high protein very low carbs and very low sugar! Perfect blend for lean muscle gain! Using this protein I have added a solid 20 pounds in 4 months! And lost 4% body fat! I recommend this product to everyone I know that works out! I will continue to take this \n",
      "\n",
      "This protein blend has a great profile which is why I bought it. The taste does leave a little to be desired but I have definitely had worse. If this can be had on sale, I believe it's worth a shot. \n",
      "i went through a lot of blends until i started using fusion7. this is by far the best protein blend for your money. great for meal replacement, post workout, and even if you need to finish off your macros at the end of the night. tastes great, blends perfectly, and is a great deal! a must have for any stack!\n",
      "This is the best Protein out you get 7 proteins plus Fiber, BCAA's you get a good blend of what you need FUSION 7 BABY!!!!!!!\n",
      "Good tasting. Mixes well with yogurt. I've been using the product for a couple of years now. No complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent protein, it caused digestion problems if I took more than a single dose in a shake or two single servings too close together.\n",
      "Okay, so I recently purchased 2 lbs of the Dymatize Fusion 7 protein powder! I went for the Chocolate Peanut Butter flavour as it appealed to my taste buds. So I just opened the tub, I'll give you my immediate thoughts on the taste/texture. Also, I mixed 1 scoop with 13 oz's of 2% milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "First impression, tastes delicious. I've had other peanut butter/chocolate flavoured proteins where one flavour outweighs the other favourably but this protein has a nice balance of creamy peanut butter and chocolate. There is no \"nasty\" protein after taste that concerns a lot of people as well so I'm very content in terms of flavour. As for texture, since I used milk there's a nice creamy texture that goes nicely with the smooth flavour. It's not as thick as a casein protein but it's still smoothie-ish. I think that almond milk would be a better fit though, that's just a personal preference though.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I can update this review I will post my results in terms of recovery, I'm doing shoulders tonight and I still have some dom's from my leg workout yesterday so it should be a good test of it's recovery capabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for now, very content, I would suggest this product to friends/other fitness people.\n",
      "Good product just because of its ingredients and results but the flavors taste like a-hole. Try mixing the protein in with yogurt or milkshakes and it is much better. \n",
      "One of the best flavors ever.\n",
      "Great Protein overall. Tastes better with a little less water, still mixes well. Great product for morning kick-start and after workouts. Doesn't seem to be wasting the protein because of the different types. Taking about 3-4 scoops a day, no ***** :D Will buy again.\n",
      "By far my favorite flavor & whey protein to take. Recommend even mixing a scoop w/oatmeal for breakfast. I've gotten the Orange Dreamsicle flavor at least 8 times (between the Muscle Milk & Dymatize brand), and don't see myself switching anytime soon, even have gotten several friends/co-workers to switch from their current flavor. Definitely recommend trying this flavor at least once, you will not be disappointed.\n",
      "I've bought these products twice because they're so good.  I use them as a post workout shake and as a meal replacement or when the munchies are getting to me.  The vanilla was pretty good but chocolate is where is at.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a protein shake/meal replacement. \n",
      "Having been completely satisfied with Dymatize Fusion 7 protein powder, I have ordered it again. The taste is great, and it quickly blends into whatever liquid I've tried it with. Most importantly, their mix of whey, milk and egg protein in seven different forms offers quick, sustained and long term absorption rates throughout the day to keep your muscles fed...Great product! I've gained at least five pounds of muscle on this stuff within three months.\n",
      "I usually buy Dymatize's Elite XT in fudge brownie, but thought I'd try Elite Fusion out for a change. Compared to the Elite XT, I was disappointed in both the flavor and how it mixes. Not a bad protein, just prefer Elite XT fudge brownie to this.\n",
      "Best tasting protein I have tried.  Great quality and affordable.\n",
      "This flavor is like having an ice cream dessert. I add blueberries to mine with almond milk and ice. Perfect. \n",
      "Very good protein mixes well and tastes very good especially the Banana Smoothie.\n",
      "I bought this protein because it was on a black Friday deal that came with an extra 2 lb tub for free. Both flavors where very good the creamy vanilla was a very very good flavor. Mixabillity is really good, the vanilla mixes up real nice a little better than the cappuccino. I would say its a solid protein, nothing special but like a regular good protein product. Dymatize is a great brand.\n",
      "Great taste and I only mix with water. \n",
      "I, M HIGHLY RATE  THIS PRODUCT, I PURCHAISE THIS ITEM A FEW WEEKS GO. I GAIN 10 Lbs IN JUST ABOUT 19 DAYS, MY  WIFE LOVE IT SO ARE MY, I RECOMAND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY ONE  WHO LOOKING FOR SOME DELIGHTFUL TASE PROTEIN. ALSO LOOKING TO GAIN WEIGHT AT THE SAMETIME, THIS IS ONE OF MY TOP PROTEIN  I'AM APRECIATE ALSO FOR THE FAST DELIVRY SERVICE AND GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE \n",
      "\n",
      "Great product! Not to mention great taste as well!\n",
      "Smooth, creamy, mixes well and the competitive price for a high quality product... what's not too like? Every other day I mix 1 scoop of vanilla and 1 scoop cappuccino rush for  sustainable energy for my morning workout and a scoop of vanilla later after dinner. I would recommend this product to my friends and family who are looking for a quality multi-protein blend to satisfy their needs.  \n",
      "Great all encompassing protein!  I take it post work-out with  a glutamine and BCAA powder and the chocolate peanut butter before bed as a late night desert.  have been very pleased with lean mass results and strength results.  Great taste as well.  I feel it is a very good protein profile that allows me to take it at any time.\n",
      "Great flavor, but the ISO mixes much better.  \n",
      "Def one of the best tasting. Mixing is okay.  Vanilla is one of the best compared to other vanillas, and strawberry is def great. \n",
      "The orange dreamsicle flavor has to be the best tasting protein shake that i have ever tasted in my entire life, and i've tried a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I just ordered this product to try it out. I am looking for a leaner body and to also have something to hold me over during the day when I can not fit in a proper meal. is this recommended for leaning out or? \n",
      "The product did not mix well but overall it tasted good. There were always chunks of it after each mix though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't mix well, taste is like a bad 80s Weider product, not seeing any of the advertised benefits. Gaspari makes better products for less.\n",
      "Elite Fusion 7 is my favorite protein shake.  I used to buy the Designer Whey brand but this one eclipses it in taste by far. My favorite flavors are Cookies nCream and Chocolate followed by the Cappuccino Rush. The Banana is so so. It reminds me of the Banana flavored Now and Laters candy.\n",
      "I hate regular Whey because it absorbs way too fast.\n",
      "I like this one, It has 7 proteins obviously and this is a fast, medium and slow digestive protein which is epic.\n",
      "Great taste \n",
      "I really enjoy this protein.  Its great right after my morning workout (Orange Dreamsicle) and before bed at night (Rich Chocolate).   It tastes great with unsweetened almond milk. I also like the fact that it has both fiber and CLA included. Highly recommend for those who are looking for a protein blend!!  \n",
      "This shake is excellent. The only down I have to say is be aware that the cappuccino rush contains 100 mg of cafeine! I didn't notice it when I bought it. So, I'm kinda a bit upset. The taste is awesome tho...\n",
      "The taste is NOT good. The only way to buy it again is, if they have \"buy one, take five free\". \n",
      "I totally love this product. It is great and the vanilla and cookie and fantastic. The chocolate is the same as any other brand in flavor but the other 2 are fantabulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The product is well built and smart and if you want get some whey but I will admit their whey isn't nearly as tasty as the Fusion 7. It tastes watered down even with milk.\n",

      "Why would Dynamatize mess up a good thing  ? The new  flavored Cookies and cream,Strawberry shake,Strawberry & Banana taste just plain horrible ! I don't understand why Dynamatize would change it. I'm never purchasing Fusion 7 again unless they go back to the old formula, I have 5 jugs of this stuff brand new that I ordered and I will be returning them. I sent  Dynamatize an email and numerous phone calls to voice my opinion and nobody ever called me back,That's horrible customer service ! \n",
      "Like everybody else, I really prefer'd the old and unimproved version of the Fusion 7, compared to this so called 'new and improved'. It's not that it's bad or anything..... just why fix something that wasn't broken? It USED to be the BEST!\n",
      "Maybe if we keep asking for the previous line, they'd switch back.\n",
      "you should try this new flavor i have ordered the small one to try and i was shoked by its flavor i took it with a skimmed milk and here you go you have something incrediable, belive me peeps this stuff is good give it a try\n",
      "I love the taste of this one. I take it rite after my workouts and I'm not as hungry so it holds me over which is good. Going to try the chocolate next time..\n",
      "This product has a good profile, but the last two containers that I bought of the Cappuccino Rush had a weird after taste. I sent the first one back because it was so bad. The replacement that they sent was the same way, just not as bad, so I kept it. It tasted like they're putting too much vitamin additive in it or something. Elite Fusion 7 is good stuff, just choose another flavor.\n",
      "I agree with other reviewers. The old formula tasted great and was by far the best protein I had ever taken. The \"new Improved taste\" formula has an off flavor and an aftertaste. If they don't bring back the original taste, I will switch to another brand.\n",
      "This used to be the only protein that actually tasted good...until they changed it !! Why change a good thing??? I have to mix peanut butter and other things just to be able to stomach it down. Terrible\n",
      "This use to be a Great tasting protein, why change the flovor and make it taste like 80% of the other crap out there, I guess I will go back to Myofusion.\n",
      "This was my favorite protein flavor but I don't particularly care for this new and supposedly improved formula. Hope that Dymatize reconsiders and goes back to the previous version. \n",
      "please change it back to the old taste/flavor of Cookies and Cream or at least make it a flavor that you can buy. Thank you in advanced \n",
      "\n",
      "Love the taste and the mixablilty!  \n",
      "\n",
      "The previous blend of Fusion 7 was perhaps the best tasting protein I've ever had, and I've tried a bunch of different brands and flavors.  The \"new and improved\" taste is a major step backwards and I would think that most people would agree.  My girlfriend and I used to love this protein, but I doubt we will ever purchase again.  I truly hope that Dymatize does some due diligence on their end and recognizes the mistake they made, especially considering that the supplementation industry is a relatively niche market and customers are usually pretty loyal to the products that they buy.\n",
      "I have heard mixed reviews in regards to the new flavor profile. I was unable to taste the original so I am unable to offer a comparison review. However, the creamy vanilla is very good if you know what to expect in regards to taste. This flavor isn't your standard vanilla ice cream. I compare the taste to a swiss miss vanilla pudding. So, still a great taste but not the vanilla ice cream flavor that typically hits when you think of vanilla. \n",
      "\n",
      "In regards to fat content I have seen some complaints. One thing to consider is for 5grams of fat only one is saturated fat. Compare this to other brands that have 1G of fat and 0.5g is saturated fat. With Dymatize you're getting 4g of healthy fats and chances are you need those. Rarely, do we take in enough healthy fats. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can make a comparison of this product vs. Muscletechs Phase 8. For me both products have a nice flavor. However, Phase 8 has a gritty texture where as Dymatize is smooth/creamy. It's a close call based upon protien content, carbs, sugar and price but for me I would give Dymatize creamy vanilla a slight edge over Phase 8 vanilla.\n",
      "Just wanted to give some feedback as all the flavors have new taste recipes that are supposedly \"New and Improved\". I disagree. I use this stuff like clockwork and have for over 2 years now. Prior to changing the recipe, \"Creamy Vanilla Shake\" was the the best tasting protein I had ever found and was extremely versatile for use from shakes to ice cream. Now the new taste has what I would describe as a \"buttery\" flavor...not exactly ideal. I'm sure I will get used to it, but in my opinion, the flavor was previously perfect and is now far from it. \n",
      "If you are a coffee lover like me get mochaccino rush. It taste a little bitter and a little bit too sweet, but thats what gives its unique taste.  Since im bulking the 190 calorie powder plus the 150 calorie whole milk gives it a whopping 340 calories.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes up fine, good blend of protein. I enjoyed the mochaccino rush flavor at first...but after a while it got very old... I would not order that flavor again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great protein, great taste, affordable price. \n",
      "Excellent post-workout shake.  I like it mix mine w/ bananas, peanut butter powder, & coffee.  Amazing!  \n",
      "Tast great, mixes well, plus I like the breakdown of BCAA's etc.\n",
      "Well, I've been taking this for a year now and still love it. Mochaccino Rush is my favorite. I'm now doubling up on my protein and it goes great with 1% or 2% Milk.\n",
      "Dynmatize Fusion 7 is my favorite protein for any time of day. Not only does it taste first-class, but it has a great blend of quality proteins, vitamins and minerals. BCAAs, glutamine, and fiber are included in the blend as well. Overall it is an amazing tasting protein (in water!) and is packed with good stuff your body will thank you for.\n",
      "This is my new favorite whey. It tastes great and mixes easy.\n",
      "This product not only is amazing because of its 7 types of protein but has awesome taste. Most of the time I cant stand a protein powder without milk. Water mixture just doesnt taste right. However, with this brand I have been able to mix it with water and still have great flavor. I can't wait to try it with some milk. \n",
      "I bought this last week during BB.com's birthday sale.  I was just going to buy more ISO-100, but then I saw the Fusion-7, which seemed kind of interesting...an \"anytime\" protein which I would use for early mornings and between meal times.  So I bought it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "-The taste is okay, but in my opinion the Iso chocolate and Elite Casein chocolate and vanilla all taste MUCH better.\n",
      "-It does have a nice smooth \" velvety\" texture, I'm assuming due to the added fiber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-Almost double the calories of the Iso; the Fusion is 190 calories, 50 from fat (6g total, 2 sat fat), 1g sugar compared to the Iso with 106 cal, 0 from fat, 0 sugar.\n",
      "-less servings due to bigger scoop size (44g Fusion-7 versus 28g Iso), 53  Fusion, vs 81  Iso.\n",
      "I love this stuff! Best post workout formula I have had. It reduces my fatigue and I've noticed considerable gains in lean muscle mass and strength. I highly recommend this stuff\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a \"sweets\" person, but this stuff you will crave!!  Great post workout powder!  I feel a mass difference as a meal replacement during the day.  Good with frozen bananas, pineapple, blueberry,, etc.  Flavor and quality are unbeatable!! \n",
      "This protein is essential for any bodybuilder or anyone involved in the continual breakdown of muscle fibers. Dymatize Elite Fusion has a complex of various proteins designed to release the nutrients to your recovering muscle fibers over the course of several hours as opposed to all at once. The Mochaccino Rush flavor is alright but I think the Chocolate is better.\n",
      "Creamy Vanilla Shake taste so good I started to crave my shakes! I was extremely happy with this protien.\n",
      "i bought this mainly for cooking with, it doesnt have enough fast burning protein for post workout or early morning. just because of the casein and other slower proteins it contains. but it tastes pretty good if consumed by itself. just a little blan when you cook with it in certain things. i been using it to make protein strawberry ice cream and consume right before bed because the different range of proteins release all through the night. \n",
      "\n",
      "OM NOM NOM NOM NOM. Just want more of it all the time. Tastes awesome, helps curb my chocolate cravings. Tastes AWESOME with milk (+ better for recovery). MOAR\n",
      "I think it's a pretty good blend and the taste was good, I don't really mind the calories and it has a decent amount of fiber\n",
      "Great product and keeps you feeling full longer, great profile and the mocha flavor is a 10/10. Tastes like iced coffee with a bit of chocolate. Really like the fact that the mocha flavor also has 100mg of caffeine per scoop. This is amazing for early mornings to give you the benefits of a morning coffee plus a good protein serving. \n",
      "This is a really great protein. Loved taking it and the recovery from this product is amazing! It was like I could pull all my muscles working out take this and I`m healed! Great mix of proteins and the flavour of it was good too. I would really reccomend this to others.\n",
      "mochaccino was a unique tasting mocha flavor but i would get it again.  mixes ok with water, still noticed very small \"chunking\" in a shaker but i also try to minimize the amount of water i use. more water eliminates this issue.  good serving sizes and value compared to other brands\n",
      "I seriously had doubt because i've been using myofusion from gaspari, but i gotta tell you this protein is the ****. I've always hated vanilla but this protein is really something. It mixes with everything. I put my creatine inside and it taste even better. \n",
      "Loving Mochaccino Rush flavor. One thing I didn't catch on the online label was that it had caffiene. About 100g per serving. Wasn't a big issue since I use this as my own weight gainer in the morning. Taken by itself you can sense the caffeine rush as if you were drinking some starbucks in the morning.\n",
      "This is by far the best tasting protein that I have ever tasted. Props to Dymatize for making a great product!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "my fav protein supp...best protein blend/mix on the market...dymatizes flavors are on thier own level...the banana flavor is amazing..and so is cookies and cream..tried evryone except strawberry..hope to take that to soon...highly recommend...7 different proteins for maximum gains ..2 scoops with milk...cant lose\n",
      "\n",
      "All I can say is: hands down best tasting protein I've ever tried. Even in water it doesn't feel \"watered\" down. With almond milk it's like a treat. I'm pretty sure I could freeze the stuff and it'd be like ice cream! It's not too sickly sweet that you get tired of it. Coulda been a lil more chocolatey though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also keeps me feeling full for longer than I would have expected. I don't feel bloated, no gas, just full. It's great. For the price I'd say it's a really good bargain! It does have a bad tendency to clump up even when mixed in a blender. Using with water helps, but still doesn't get rid of all the clumps.\n",
      "I have a tub of ISO 100 chocolate and really like it. The taste is really great too so when I wanted to add a shake that had several proteins in it I figured I would give the fusion 7 a shot. I got the peanut butter and the taste is horrific. It has a strong chemical taste to it. I have even shaked the tub repeatedly with no success. I don't know what others are tasting but I can't wait till I'm done this tub to buy another kind.\n",
      " I made gains with this product and am happy with it.\n",
      "Halfway done through my 5 lb tub and even though I usually don't like buying the same protein over and over, I'm going to make an exception this time because this protein is absolutely delicious. The vanilla tastes like a milkshake and it's been helping me gain lean mass ever since I got it. Definitely gave a boost to my physique and I would recommend to anyone trying to pack on some muscle.\n",
      "in my opinion, this is one of the best proteins on the market. the chocolate peanut butter is AMAZING! no clumps and is really great tasting. if you want a excellent protein go with this one\n",
      "This is the best tasting protein powder I have tried so far. Not too sweet when mixed with water, but as per usual of protein powders, definitely tastes much better with any type of milk. The texture is a little bit more thick than whey powders, but the powder does mix well with no clumps in both water and milks. Great nutritional profile, especially including the fiber and blend of proteins, which helps keep me full for 3-4 hours. I generally mix this with lactose-free milk and chia seed (if you're familiar with boba, chia has a similar texture when soaked in liquid) and drink one shake a day as a meal replacement. Within a week of use, I have noticed I am stabilizing at my weight but am also losing body fat, thus building muscle and losing fat and getting even closer to my goal(s).\n",
      "I have tried many proteins but this one has been my favorite. I recently switched from Myofusion to this and have seen great results. The taste of Fusion 7 Vanilla Shake is awesome, however if you are considering Dymatize Elite gourmet Vanilla stay away from it, it is nothing like this. As for the benefits of Fusion 7, it does have alot more calories then I would usually go for but I def noticed some good clean bulking with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By far, the BEST TASTING whey powder yet! I've tried a lot and this one does it for me. I'm a Reese's kinda guy so I wondered if this flavor would live up to my expectations. It exceeded them. Try it...you WON'T be disappointed.\n",
      "I've tried 3 flavors so far, and overall Fusion 7 isn't bad. It?s one of my favorite proteins mainly because of the price. It?s a versatile protein, I can use it for either pre or post workout or as a meal replacement. The mixability is about average and the taste isn't anything special. Cookies and cream was AWEFUL!!!!!  Strawberry and mochaccino were good but not great. Supposedly Dymatize is known for their flavors and mixability, I call bullcrap. Next time I?ll either try a different flavor, or I?ll switch to a different brand. I wish they had more of a variety of fruitier flavors because I?m getting sick of chocolate and vanilla protein flavors.\n",
      " given the profile, I would say it's best protein for the price. I am trying to bulk up so higher calories are beneficial to me .. so far so good i would say.. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and I am going to order another tub coming month ...\n",
      "\n",
      "The chocolate peanut butter is so delicious; I mix it with coconut milk or rice milk and it's just freakin awesome!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to try Dymatize after seeing what it did for Brock Lesnar (smile), but it seems most of the mass was in the caloric intake. The protein content is solid and the banana flavor tastes really good, but the only Dymatize product I'll add to my lineup is ISO 100. ...GREAT product\n",
      " Price: 10/10\n",
      "Read the ingredients &quot;Sucralose&quot; = Splenda or Artificial Sweetener, horrible for your body. Wonder why it taste so good...\n",
      " I am definitely ordering this product again!\n",
      "Have been making steady weight gains with this product over the last 4 months, just started working out again but have gained 15-20 lbs and this is the only supplement I take so I attribute most of my gains towards consistency and this protein.  I take a shake every morn, preworkout, postworkout, and before bedtime, and in between meals if possible.  It tastes very good, mixes ****ght but you definitely need a shaker cup, and costs cheaper than most. \n",
      "this mixes well and tastes great. i use it to start the day! super good\n",
      "This is my breakfast every morning. Mixes pretty well. tastes great and i like the ingredients. I usually mix with fat free milk and it tastes kind of like strawberry cake. occasionally I use whole milk... wow! It tastes like a strawberry milkshake. I am planning on trying chocolate with my next order.\n",
      "awesome best tasting vanilla Ive tried mixes great!better tasting than myofusion vanilla cleaner than syntha 6.try it you wont be dissapointed.\n",
      "I have used this product for the last 4 or 5 months and I used Myofusion before this. The taste is fantastic and it blends well. I use it in pancakes and coffee and the flavor holds up in the heating process. I love it. I have tried just about everything and one time or another and for the cost it is a reasonable price for a great tasting product.\n",
      "One of the best tasting protein formulas compared to the other popular brands especially ON. Mixes excellent in water or fat free milk using just a shaker. Highly recommended!!\n",
      "i like this product. i have tried all of the protein powder they have i would have to say this is the best they have. The only con is that the price is a little on the expensive side but its worth it in my opinion. i will buy again.\n",
      " I highly recommend this protein blend.\n",
      "Vraiment bon comme prot&eacute;ine et tr&egrave;s complete.\n",
      "Love it! Cut my bad bulk from rugby and gain lean muscle for the summer. Awesome taste. I take it after i workout and before i sleep depending on the time of my workout\n",
      " I drink my shakes with water only and this mixes with no effort. Smooth creamy taste with no bitter after taste. Plus, I'm 42 years old and have to watch my sugar intake. I can drink it before bed with no weight gain and my body / stomach feels fine with no burping. My second choice of course is MP!!! Both tied for quality, blending, and taste.\n",
      "Great protein staying with this one for now on\n",
      "This is one of the best tasting proteins I've ever had, and it has all the goodies you need after a workout. I mix 2-2.5 scoops with some grounded oats after my workouts and sometimes feel like hitting the gym again before I go to bed.\n",
      "AWESOME TEXTURE AND TASTE!\n",
      "A pretty solid protein powder. It does not mix as well as some other powders--a shaker bottle will not work. Great taste in milk (I add a little choc. syrup too). I haven't been using it very long, but I think it works as well as or better than the other powders I've used. I'd definitely recommend.\n",
      "I tried many different protein powder, but after 2 years. Man DYMATIZE IS THE BEST...\n",
      "The Price the taste the mixture all excellent, I normally use chocolate in my protein shakes , decided to try the cookies and cream and what a great decision it was, as for results i just started using it, so i will get back to you in 3 months and give my final score, as for now i give it a 9.....\n",
      "Very good Vanilla flavor and I am not a very big fan of vanilla. I usually mix with 6oz Water, Frozen Strawberry 2 Teaspoon of Cinnamon, 1/3 Banana = Best Mix Ever!. I never had an awesome protein shake like this one. This protein ranks among the best of vanilla protein in my opinion. Nice job Dymatize! Not concerned with 6g Fat, that's average. 2g of Saturated Fat is ideal. 11g Carbs - 5g Fiber = 6g Carbs actually, not bad.\n",
      "Great product! This product has an excellent profile. It's perfect for a meal replacement powder. I use this product for breakfast. One scoop with some skim milk, peanut butter and bananna gives me about 560 calories. Taste is good too. This powder provides a great foundation for a meal replacement. If your cutting calories or watching your carb intake just keep it as is. However, if your bulking just add some oats or peanut butter to up the calories.\n",
      "The Taste is Great! I only use Water to mix it as I have cut out all dairy products. I am sure it would taste AMAZING with milk because it's great with just water. Obviously tastes much better when blended with ice/water in a blender, but mixes well in just a shaker cup. Two scoops can put the caloric value over the top, as it will approach about 400 calories, so I am careful to use 2 scoops post workout only. I have the chocolate as well, it tastes pretty darn good too, but not as good as the vanilla in my opinion. Not too much gas with this either, and absolutely no bloating with it!\n",
      " Every Dymatize product I've ever used is excellent, and the slightly higher price than the cheap stuff is made up for with their focus on providing consumers with something that other companies do not offer.\n",
      "Hands down THE best protein i have ever tasted. Mixes perfectly in water, no chunks at all. The nutrient profile is unbeatable. It actually does taste like a vanilla milkshake.. I was very surprised when I first tried it. This stuff tastes way better than Dymatize's Gourmet Vanilla\n",
      "I am a huge fan of this protein! I take it as a post-workout meal along with fruits/veggies. The flavor is great and I really enjoy the added carbs, especially since I am a runner and need all I can get! I am definitely going to try the other flavors available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely the best tasting Protein powder I've ever used. Dymatize has certainly hit the mark with the Elite Fusion 7. I normally consume 1.5 scoops for breakfast, 1.5 post workout and 1 scoop before bed. Not only have I noticed really nice gains (dropped 4% in bodyfat and gained 2lbs of muscle in 3 weeks), but my sleep has improved and I'm waking up with great mental clarity. My girlfriend has also begun using EF7. She loves the idea of low Carbs and low sugar. Thanks Dymatize!!\n",
      "just purchased this and mixed with both almond milk and water and both taste great! powder mixes very well, no clumping and easy on the stomach. and goes down smooth\n",
      "Smells great. Mixes terribly. I mixed it the same as I do other proteins in a shaker with water but multiple lumps. Had to put it in a blender. Taste was awful. Leaves horrible after taste too. If you are used to good flavors from gaspari and ON, then stick with them. I find Dymatize consistanetly disappoints...their casein vanilla is far too sweet and their discontinued fusion product tasted and looked like chalk!!\n",
      "I love the taste, it's even better than Gaspari's MyoFusion and at a slightly cheaper price, plus I love the protein variety and high glutamine precursors. I take this sometimes as a meal replacement, or a smaller amount between meals, and definitely directly after a workout. I also use Dymatize's casein blend before bed, but the Fusion 7 is by far the best tasting protein I've ever had!\n",
      "Outstanding taste! I look forward to drinking this one.\n",
      "Tastes good, keeps you relatively full if mixed with milk. Clumps somewhat in milk, but not water. Tastes good mixed with water as well. I have noticed slight increased in strength and alertness while on this product. I would definately recommend it!\n",
      "best tasting protein ever tasted\n",
      "Elite mass helped me gain lean mass.. I used water Taasted good to me.. I don't buy protein products for taste.. Just care about end result.. Elite mass got the job done period...\n",
      "Best gainer ever\n",
      "Gainer mixes well in water or almond milk in shaker cup which is always a plus. Taste well \n",
      "This product was not very helpful at all. It was a waste of my money with negative results. Literally no muscle or weight gain at all. Good taste with no results. Good luck body builders. If I could but it's to late, I would've ask for a refund on this product..... My next product will be the ISO-100 which does have positive results from people I've spoken to.\n",
      " Dymatize elite mass gainer is one of the best proteins on the market. Great!! for gaining size. Complex carbohydrates, creatine, monohydrate, BCAAS(branched chain amino acids) and vitamins. Also taste amazing I like to take it on the go put some in a shaker and add water and it's ready. It does exactly what I want it to do, I don't have a negative thing to say about it I Introduce my friends to it and now there hook thank you Dymatize!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "really good product for gains. makes me a little bloated which doesnt bother me too much. would recommend\n",
      "Never gained a pound \n",
      "This is a really good gainer and I used to love the flavor, but the new Vanilla flavor is just disgusting. Now I'm stuck with 10lbs of disgusting vanilla flavored gainer. This change was the worst thing dymatize could have done to the product.\n",
      "great weight gainer with quality protein. very  low in sugar and fat which is awesome. definitely helped me put on a lot of mass. chocolate flavor tastes great. and you can't beat the price - 10 lbs for less than $60!\n",
      "This product mixes great, tastes great, and is an easy way to get in another 600 calories between meals. Highly recommended. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about with this product is the cheap packaging: a cardboard box with a cheap ziploc-style bag holding all this precious protein. Great product, nonetheless.\n",
      "I started to use Dymatize elite whey, then changed to their Iso 100, now just finished my first 10lb box of Elite mass gainer. I love this stuff. I am a hardgainer, and have put on 9 lbs of muscle in the past month with this. Very smooth with water, and doesn't get thick like other shakes. I use it once/twice daily (depending on day and workout schedule). I just ordered another box of strawberries & cream, but might try cookies and cream next. I have used other gainers in the past, but this is by far the best one I have tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice product noticed mass after a week. I would buy again.\n",
      "This was the first dymatize product I've ever tried and I'm a huge fan now, I take this as a snack every day (use Iso 100 for post workout) I've made good gains from this product, it taste awesome, and its a decent price. highly recommend the 10 pound bag don't waste money on more expensive lean gainers buy this!!! (I put water in first and haven't had an issue on mixing, once I put powder in first didn't mix well)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes great with skim/whole milk. Great for a GOMAD/trying to add that extra 1000~ calories to your diet while bulking for hardgainers to reach that 3500-5000 area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great stack, mix banana and double chocolate for an epic drink in mix. Banana is great in water - chocolate is a bit chunky. Milk works better. Mix the flavors around, don't simply get one flavor!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "i ordered iso 100 and casein from dymatize and they are both 10/10 excellent products. i rodered this and i weighed the 10 lb bag and it came out to 9.5.... so this is the rating they get\n",
      "I ordered this product largely on the basis of excellent reviews given in this forum.  I can see now that reviews here are completely unreliable or possibly front-loaded by supplement companies posing as users.  Elie Mass is far inferior to nearly every other mass gainer I've used in 25 yrs of mass supplementation.  \n",
      "The product is thin and not nutrient-dense at all.  Like with most supps, the labelling is fraudulent, giving serving sizes that are arbitrary and chosen simply to amplify the nutrient level per phony \"serving\".  (Even the supplied scoop is fraudulent, graded in mL which is a measure of liquids not solids.)  \n",
      "\n",
      "I standardize my serving for evaluation to 2x70cc scoops (140cc) mixed in 1% milk. The actual grams in this standardized serving will vary with each product's supplied density.  In this standardized prep, Dymatize Elite is much thinner than most weight/mass gain supps I have used.  I also observe less nutritive effect after consuming (less calories, less bio-avail protein, etc).  \n",
      "\n",
      "As if that weren't enough, mixability is very poor.  I always use hand mixing in glass to standardize my use.  With Dymatize Elite there is considerable clumping and \"mud\" at the bottom, and it requires greater mix effort \n",
      "than other supps.  Results in water may be different, but as I said, the product is already way too thin in milk.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the taste is not very good.  The \"Chocolate\" flavor is quite sweet but does not actually taste like chocolate (even though it is quite dark, which leads me to think there is some serious artificial coloring going on here).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, my first (and last) experience is that Dymatize Elite is poor in quality and results.  I am going back to my preferred protein/mass supps; plain old Cytosport Muscle Milk, or Universal Real Gains.  PLEASE NOTE:I am NOT a fitness pro or supplement co. employee, just an actual user who never reviews anything I don't have direct personal experience with!\n",
      "\n",
      "It taste good and it gain lean muscle!  My weight doesn't change much, probably increase 4 or 5 lbs from the last month, but I have gained so much more muscle.  I tried other weight gainer, like serious mass, up your mass, and some GNC product...the serious mass and the GNC weight gainer does gain more weight but I tend to loss my abs and gain fat.  I think up your mass is pretty similar to the elite mass but has more oil in it...  This product gain only muscle!!!  And I don't have to spend that much time to kill all the fat from the weight gainer.  If you want to gain lots of weight, take serious mass.  But if you only want to gain muscle and not losing weight from extreme workout...take this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally....this is the first weight gainer that actually helped me gain good healthy weight!!! I've tried so many that helped me gain weight but the majority of  weight gain was fat. I was constantly bloated with other gainers BUT not with this one. Everyone would suggest homemade gainers too but all they ever did was make me super bloated. I have only tried the  strawberry flavor so far and it's pretty good. I'm so glad I tried this bc I almost didn't due to the price. Totally worth it!!!!\n",
      "Helps me get my calories in... Without the extra fat in sugar.  What more could you ask for?\n",
      "\n",
      "perfect ingredients, real results. Highley recommended \n",
      "As far as clean gainers go, there is really no comparison. This product is loaded with protein, carbs, healthy fats, and vitamins with only 1g of sugar. The chocolate flavor is the only one I have liked. It mixes well only in a blender and goes down smooth. The strawberry has almost no flavor which is great for adding into fruit smoothies, while the cookies and cream taste like sour milk with gross cookie pieces floating around. Overall it's a great product because it taste decent and gives great results. \n",
      "\n",
      "This has to be one of the worse mass gainers I've used. I use a large shaker cup with enough water and it never completely mixes. I'm left with large clumps. Even if I decrease the scoops, I still have clumps. This makes it rather un-enjoyable. \n",
      "\n",
      "This Is my most recommended gainer to anyone who asks what I take, Mixes perfectly in a shaker, tastes fantastic. enough protein and carbs to help put on some mass but too much. low fat and low sugar, great prouduct by a great company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great protein. Iv been using this now for almost a year and still think this is the best protein out there. From carbs to bcaas and creatine everything you look for in a lean mass gainers protein. Dosent give you a gut or excess fat anywhwere due to the balance of calories they didnt over due it. Get this mass gainer if your still trying to stay lean but build some muscle!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my second mass gainer and my favorite so far. Chose strawberry &amp;amp; cream to switch up my go-to flavor of vanilla. Definitely recommend drinking it with milk for more calories and better flavor but i didnt get it for the taste. I have gained about 6 lbs in about 2-3 weeks. Best ingredient line for the product that i have seen so far. Will definitely reorder once i finish all 10 lbs of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had been lifting for about 6 months before I took any supplements so I was not noticing much change in my body. I then ordered this product and within 3 and a half weeks ive noticed a difference. This product is easy to drink. I plan on ordering again!\n",
      "I have tried Pro-Complex gainer, cytogainer, Real Gains and ISO Mass extreme gainer. After trying Elite Mass I have finally reached satisfaction. Ingredients are great. Malto is primary carb source but nearly all gainers have the same. Price is right, taste is great and ingredients are perfect. I've finished off 1x 6lb-er and have gained around 6-7lbs. Although this is coupled with well balanced dieting and 5x other square meals per day. Great product, already ordered more. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a solid mass gainer. I really liked the flavor im not much of a strawberry guy but i took this down 2 times a day with ease. the results were nice gained atleast 10 pounds of muscle pushing toward 15. No real complaints did leave u full if u take it down after a meal but thats normal.\n",
      "My first mass gainer and it mixes well with the whey protein from the same brand. Good flavor. Good results so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product.\n",
      "by far the best weightgainer in the market,my muscles are fuller,i feel stronger,bigger.the taste is so good.hell with truemass\n",
      " i haven't really seen much results with this, but my recovery is much faster.\n",
      "Amazing taste!! A lot of gainers don't taste great, and IF they do it's loaded with sugars. This taste both awesome and has barely any sugar at all. Just started using this but so far I'm loving it.\n",
      "Great product didn't gain too much weight, but my friends gained 10lbs in a month. I gained about 5 pounds in 2 weeks tasted awesome. I would recommend this product on the basis that it is cheap and a great weight gainer.\n",
      "This is a great product! Taste good, not a strong flavor, with no aftertaste &amp;amp; produces great results!!\n",
      "This is by far, the best pound for pound post workout shake on the market, in my opinion. The taste is fantastic, it mixes well with others. As well, deliver 600 calories, well I use the a half-serving of 300 caloies, and it's still 100% sugar fre. The complex carb and whey-casien blend protiens keep feeded my body for hours, as opposed to traditional whey. This keeps me full, and keeps me gaining.\n",
      "I've been using Dymatize for the last 2 years and love it. I settled into the Fudge brownie which is fantastic with a little peanut butter power and oatmeal in the morning. Breaks down well in a shaker and unbeatable at this price point.\n",
      "For the taste,and the price,you can,t beat it.\n",
      "Recently decided to give Dymatize a shot, definitely a great bang for your buck. I haven't tried Vanilla flavors from other brands but I've mostly heard negatives. Rich Vanilla Elite XT tastes great though, and even though I see what some people mean by chalky consistency, it's not really not that big of a problem. Highly recommend, especially if you're on a budget.\n",
      "Really love this stuff! The taste is great and I think it mixes pretty well. I've tried it with water, cashew milk, almond milk, coconut milk and skim and it's all pretty good. I use it mostly as a meal replacement and as such it does the job. I have just ordered my second 4lb tub. At $30 for that much, it's a great deal too! I work with some guys who are in much better shape and they use this too in a couple of flavors so I feel like even though I'm fairly new to this sort of thing, I may be on the right track with this. I will continue to buy and would and do recommend this to others. \n",
      "Can't beat the price and the fudge brownie taste great. In the past two weeks I've been able to maintain my body weight and shed 3% body fat. I religiously take just one scoop before bed.\n",

      "25% body fat\n",
      "Love, Love, Love! Love this product and love the Fudge Brownie flavor. I don't feel as sore the next day and absolutely helps pack on muscle. Will be reordering as soon as needed. Cheap for the amount you get as well.\n",
      "I have been using this protein for a few years now and can't get enough of it. It is typically on backorder which forces me to go elsewhere but I always try to buy this when I can. You cannot beat the price and it is perfect for substituting meals like breakfast, and great as a mid-afternoon snack to hold you off until Dinner. \n",
      "Flavor was good, price was good. Can't really complain. Good if you are on a budget\n",
      "Bought the fudge brownie and didn't care for the flavour, but it was great to use in a recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking for some cheap option of slow-realease protein. I think that for this price it's really good option. Banana flavor was tasty even with water and I was definitely more than happy cause I got 300 grams of BCAA for free with 4lbs of protein. I would recommend this product to everybody. I used it with glass of milk before bed. Gave me easy 30 grams of protein.\n",
      "Great Protein! only draw back is it doesn't mix well in a shaker cup. Typical for most Multi Protein blends.\n",
      "Taste is Okay. But I chug mine so not that important. don't mix with milk, its like drinking liquid concrete.\n",
      "\n",
      "grate taste powder mixed very good not sticky best price\n",
      "Gave this powder a 9 because of the results- Been trying diff powders for a year now and noticed improvements right away when switching to Elite XT as post workout shake. Because of the extend release its nice for staying full and fuelled as a preworkout or before work or sports too. Only tried banana nut and had to get used to the texture and flavour at first (although I'm not a huge fan of artificial banana flavour to start with). It's a little bit chalky compared to previous ones I've tried but I don't mind the taste now and it mixes well in water and almond milk. Was a good protein for me, ordered more to try by Dymatize\n",
      "Very good especially with very little water and make like a pudding but not a fan of the protein sources. better than ice cream...possibly\n",
      "Best bang for your buck and it taste great even in water.\n",
      "Tastes just like a packet of brownie mix, surprise good flavor. Consistency can taste a tad chalky but for price and results it's well worth it \n",
      "\n",
      "Can't say enough about this product. Banana-nut isn't a flavor profile I'd typically purchase, but I love it! The price is right and Dymatize is a trusted brand name. Next up, blueberry muffin. \n",
      "I was scared about the taste of chocolat after looking the rating and the very low price. But i was wrong, i try with milk and without,  in both the taste is very great and a lot creamy even in water. Make me think the taste and texture of phase 8. Before a was using ultra myosin from mtrx wich is very good but i try to find the best at the lowes price possible. And its easy to digest , i mix it with shaker bottle and blender and in both way its was good. No probleme, i think this product should be rated a lot better, and for the price its hard to find better value.\n",
      "My first time with dymatize protein product and im very happy with it\n",
      "UPDATE 2015-06-27 : come back to elite xt, for the price and try the fudge brownies.. **** good . i hope they do a 5 or 6 lbs format too, 53 scoop for a great price\n",
      "I bought 2+1 promo for this. its a good supplement as either meal replacement or pre workout or bed time. you dont have to shift to casein or other products. i like the chocolate most it has little bit of nutty crip for some reason. then vanilla is good with milk at night before bedtime. the banana nut is great for making smoothies. you dont need to add fruits or anything add a scoop of peanut butter and honey you are good to go. love this product. \n",
      "I like this protein to make recipes with.  The blueberry muffin is very good in protein pancakes and waffles but not good to drink I don't think.  My fiance really liked it in just a shake but I prefer it in my waffles.  The vanilla is good in lots of different concoctions.  It's not bad as a shake but I really use it for homemade protein bars, plain or sweet potato pancakes and other protein goodies.  Sometimes you just need to make goodies with a protein that is just vanilla and this works great!  I have tried the banana nut but did not care for it at all and have tried the chocolate, which is good with some coconut milk or almond milk as a pudding....yum! \n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent product for the price. Mixes fairly well (shaker cup or mixer ball recommended), smells great and tastes delicious. Me and my girlfriend think we found our new favorite brand.\n",
      "Very good protein powder!! Does not mix as easily as other higher priced products but hey....for the price you cant complain!! Flavor was very good and im for sure going to be buying some more of this!\n",
      "\n",
      "Def one of my favorite proteins with whey+casein together. For it's price, i'm sold! I always use this protein with my breakfast. Taste good as well!\n",
      "Low price and great taste! Not much more you can ask for! Mixes pretty well for me I don't use a lot of water because I like it to taste a little bit more like a smoothie. Banana Nut has a great taste and is a nice change from the usual chocolate for me. Great buy can't wait to try other flavors!\n",
      "I purchased this protein prior to coming to my Fall Semester of school, there was a deal going whether you go a free bottle of free-form aminos with it. The protein itself tasted awesome, it mixed great with water as well as creatine and the aminos. However, I was very disappointed when I went through the whole thing in a matter of 3 weeks. I don't know whether the serving scoop was wrong or if its just labelled wrong in general but for 4 pounds it did not last nearly a long as I thought it would have. Point aside it was a great tasting protein and the price was very hard to beat, 4 pounds for $30 is really a steal. I am trying different proteins at the moment but am very tempted to give this one another try.\n",
      "The taste is very good but im convinced i got a old bottle because i dont see the \"new taste\" label on my bottle. Anyways this tasted great & mixed quite easily in a shaker. Best chocolate protein i have personally ever tasted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes well, taste better than expected as a shake. I tried the Banana Nut flavor and it was great for making late night Brotein-Pancakes. I also love the idea that its time released so less guilt as a late night option before bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had a couple 4lb'ers of Elite XT - Banana Nut, Fudge Brownie, and Rich Vanilla.  For my girlfriend taste seems to be key.  I love to mix these in random drinks (water, milk, v8, coffee, shakes, etc).  They all have mixed well for me and she is absolutely in love with Banana Nut (makes for good banana bread and such).  To be honest I was turned off by the smell at first... but the Banana Nut definitely has a great taste and zero after taste.  It's fantastic!\n",
      "Mixing pretty Well, Rich and smoother and thicker than some brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is really good and it's keeping me fuelled for a good time!\n",
      "This product is a very decent protein. It's affordable and reliable, especially coming from a company like Dymatize. I use Dymatize products all the time and I purchased this one for use before going to bed at night being an extended release protein. The banana nut flavor is honestly what intrigued me. That's pretty much the only reason I bought this rather than your standard casein. The flavor is not bad. It has a very thick consistency. My only real gripe with this product was it's mixability. Definitely not the worst, but not great. As far as effectiveness, it definitely helped me out. I usually wake up starving but not after taking this before bed. Overall, I would recommend it to someone who wants to try something different than casein\n",
      "I've been using Elite XT for a post-workout shake for over two years now.  As commented by some others, Dymatize tried to improve the taste about a year ago and it was a big step in the wrong direction.  However, the last few containers I've purchased seem to back to the old taste for fudge brownie.  I'd definitely recommend it in its current form for anyone needing a protein powder that tastes decent and doesn't have certain supplements added in such as creatine, which I prefer to use separately during bulking phases.  There's also a decent amino profile with it as well, which saves a bit of money if you're trying not to spend an additional $50 on BCAA's.  I've never tried any of the other flavors, but the fudge brownie flavor is pretty decent as far as protein powders go.  Also, a few other reviewers have commented on the powder clumping in a shaker.  While this used to happen about 2 years ago, they seem to have resolved this issue in the current formulation.  Even when it did clump, it just made for some extra chocolaty kick.  Overall, definitely recommended for anyone needing a post-workout shake for either bulking or cutting phases.  I was able to lose about 7% body fat using this as my post-workout shake, along with a regular training regimen and controlled diet.\n",
      "Taste okay, taste better with milk. Keeps me really full which is good if your trying to lose weight so you don't get hungry to munch on something later. Great for the price flavor was okay not what I expected being it was blueberry muffin expected soething more but either than that this was a great product.\n",
      "I trust more Michael Jackson  to babysit my kids, then the label of  this product, to has Whey protein in it.\n",
      "This stuff is amazing the taste and the price is incomparable to others out there! I've literally spent thousands of dollars and proteins every brand, kind/flavor and this is bar none the best one Ive ever had besides isopure starberry wicth is literally twice the price for half the product.mixability is great and for a meal replacement or breakfast mix it with your oatmeal And you have a great tasting low cal,high protein meal quick and its ez..If you haven't tried it I'd suggest it! 💪👌💯\n",
      "average flavor, poor protein per scoop.\n",
      "The Banana Nut might just be my favorite flavor of all time. I like all Dymatize products (they are goos consistency, mix easily, and all taste good), but this flavor is amazing plain, with oatmeal, or in pancakes. Yum! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent product. mixes well in blender or by hand. Good vanilla flavor that can be enhanced by addition of fresh or frozen fruits, and flavoring products. The XT formulation means the ingestion of protein is a slower process that provides for  an even intake and lets you feel fuller longer. Right after a workout is the best time time use this product, but also good for a mid-day or evening snack.\n",
      "I love this , so refreshing after a workout mixed in a smoothie with a banana, 1 tbsp of peanut butter and choc and vanilla almond milk,and ice,  tastes like a milk shake. I make it in my magic bullet but sometimes have to stir it following to mix the powder\n",
      "Absolutely delicious!!!\n",
      "Flavor and price are amazing. I mixed the blueberry muffin into some yogurt and it turned into my favorite morning meal. The blueberry muffin got me excited about trying banana nut next. \n",
      "I mainly judge things off of flavor and how many servings I get....\n",
      "The taste gets old after a week, but I'm a chocolate lover myself. Great product and price for sure. My go to protein now. \n",
      "Bought this flavour thinking that its the safest option. But the taste is horrible and very hard to take in. \n",
      "\n",
      "The supplement as such is good, but somehow doesn't seem to be as good as what it was previously. \n",
      "\n",
      "Would recommend the Elite XT if you are looking for a long lasting protein mix, but avoid the Rich Chocolate flavour. \n",
      "\n",
      "Update -: Have to change my opinion now after using the Banana Nut flavour. When mixed with water, its gets too frothy. Tastes good, but I'm not seeing any benefits. Will not use Dymatize Elite XT again. Think they've changed something compared to older ones. \n",
      "I really like this protein, but it has too many carbs for a regular daily supplement.  I used it mostly for my post workout, as extra carbs are actually good at that time.  I really like that the protein has both Whey and Casein.  Fudge Brownie is super delicious too, reminds me of...well...brownie mix.  Can't decide if I'll order more of this, as the higher carbs aren't in my fat burning workout plan. \n",
      "Very good for its price\n",
      "I like that the product label is pretty transparent but would like to see the exact ratio of protein matrix.  I did not see or feel any significant advantage or disadvantage of Elite XT in comparison to similar products. The price is definitely good and it is a higher value (quality/price) product in its category. I would recommend this as an alternative to other protein blends. The taste is good and the powder mixes very well. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Love it. Tastes great! & i would stick to this brand for now. I take it at breakfast & after my workout. Helps my recovery & keeps me feeling full for a long period of time..hence, eating less. \n",
      "First protein I had the opportunity to order from bb.com and I am more than pleased with the quality. Absolutely perfect for either mixing with smoothies, pre-workout oat meal or just drinking plain. I would highly recommend this product!\n",
      "Awesome product.  Great price (I got a Buy 2 Get 1 for the 2 lb. containers), mixes very well, and it has a great taste.  The Banana Nut tastes amazing.  The Blueberry Muffin also has a great taste, but it is slightly less \"in your face\" than the Banana Nut.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I have no complaints with the quality.  It has a digestive enzyme blend as well as an enteric coating to delay digestion for a slower release.  It does contain soy protein, but I'm okay with that because there are plenty of studies that suggest protein blends containing soy are legit, as well as studies stating that soy protein does not elevate estrogen levels in men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "love the taste. Wish it had more protein content.\n",
      "I have seen numerous reviews that talk about how hard it is to mix, and this protein is always chunky. I have not had one issue with either flavor in mixing. They always come out well and taste amazing. Great with water and even better with milk. The banana nut tastes just like a  muffin and the fudge brownie tastes just like brownie batter (with milk). Feel a difference in recovery too. Would definitely recommend to anyone. (UPDATE) I just got the blueberry muffin flavor, and it is just as fantastic as the others. Great protein blend overall and still seeing aided recovery and staying full between meals.\n",
      "The price per serving=8 flavor=7. I got it because it came with a free BCAA. Which looking back I should've gotten two of those. The flavor is not tasty but I suppose you get what you pay for. If you mix it with other things in a shake it adds a creaminess which is pretty good. Prbly because of the slow blend. So price wise it's a good deal if you don't mind drkng something that aint the tastiest. \n",
      "I love this protein! Dymatize generally has cheaper proteins than the rest which is why i started using them, saw how cheap this was and decided to try it out. Banana Nut tastes just like banana nut bread and this is a great protein! I dont know what others are talking about... the taste is great, mixability is great and helps me to get that added protein that i dont get through diet, has whey, casein and soy with no amino spikes, etc that other companies like to do to make you think you are getting more protein per scoop. Overall great protein that i will continue to buy! \n",
      "Used banana nut to make banana bread and it turned out awesome!\n",
      "Fudge brownie is pretty good. Probably one of the best tasting chocolate protein shakes I've had. I never had the \"old\" version that the other reviewers have been talking about, but I think this version is good. It's not overly sweet unlike other chocolate proteins that I have a hard time finishing due to its artificial flavor.\n",
      "I love this product, works and testes better than anything else ive ever tried. Please lower the price a bit and Ill order a massive amount of this <3\n",
      "So good! I mixed 1/2 cup almond milk, 1/2 cup water, one scoop of elite xt, ice, and a few almonds. Love it. \n",
      "I gave a 6 out of 10 overall because it is a good protein that does the job well. BUT oh my lord, since the first scoop I have dreaded the next. For the first 5 seconds I thought, hmm not bad... not great. but then... but THEN, there was this aftertaste. apparently the new formula Dymatize is using for this product is vanilla butt hole. maybe its not their fault. maybe the other tub that i got free will be better. I think someones dirty sock fell into this container at the factory. What have you done, Dymatize? You were my go-to. \n",
      "Best tasting protein I've ever had, won't be going back to ON brand anytime soon. \n",
      "This powder was recommended to me.  It does taste great, however it doesn't always mix well.  I will keep using it because it is a great powder and it works well.\n",
      "Mixes create, tastes create, well worth the money!\n",
      "I always take my protein with coco and almond milk, the taste is very good! very creamy, the price of this protein is very good too! i take it 2 times a day,...the morning when i wake up and before bed!....\n",

      "\n",
      "Good Protein, Nice for before bed\n",
      "The \"new and improved\" taste is awful. It's amazing how they can update it so that the new flavor is listed with MORE sugar and fat, but tastes horrible compared to the old blend. Tastes chalky and bland now. \n",
      "\n",
      "Used to reccomend this flavor as my go to, but unless they update it I'm staying FAR away from dymatize. \n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt you Can't beat the price and it has solid macros for cutting or bulking (if you think you can't cut using this, then I've got some bad news for you..)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I'm disappointed that I bought this in bulk again while it was on sale. Time to start the search for a new protein once I'm able to finish my current stock of Dymatize. \n",
      "Would not Reccomend / 10\n",
      "You can't beat this protein blend for the price.  Great product, highly recommend.\n",
      "I agree with a lot of the other reviewers in that the \"new improved taste\" is not as good as the old taste.  While it is still a great protein to use for cooking, it is not as good as it used to be.  I would buy this brand again if I need protein and it was on sale, but I would not pay full price for this product unless they changed the formula back to the old blends.\n",
      "Best cheap protein there is; I use half a scoop of this to thicken up my Gold Standard Whey post - workout and I'll drink it sometimes before I sleep. The taste with milk and water is great and it has a good consistency. I know it's doing its job and it's definitely money well spent, worth a try! \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried all the major brands of proteins out there, but the fudge brownie flavor by Dymatize is the best I've had. Mixes just fine and the price is amazing to say the least. Definitely recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "****UPDATE**** The \"new improved\" flavor definitely sucks. I was hoping it wasn't true but the fudge brownie definitely tastes different. I have still had worse tasting proteins, and the price is still solid, but I really wish they wouldn't have changed the formula. It now tastes less sweet, with a slight chalky taste to it. Not terrible but not good either.\n",
      "I've tried the Fudge Brownie and it tastes delicious, and mixes with hardly any shaking, which can be an issue for other brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use it in food as well, which also works great. \n",
      "\n",
      "I saw a review that stated it's not good for cutting, which is ridiculous. As long as you're in a calorie deficit you can cut even taking this! So don't let that put you off. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just about to order my next tub!  \n",
      "I really enjoy this product, blends great and the taste is awesome. The price of this product is well worth what you get out of it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an all-in-one protein powder.\n",
      "I agree with everyone here - WHAT IS UP WITH THE NEW TASTE???  I am very disappointed in the difference and will begin to try different protein powders due to the changes made.  My favorite for my protein pancakes used to be the Banana - not anymore :(\n",
      "This used to be my favorite protein. I'd go through at least 1 tub a month. After buying both a fudge brownie and rich chocolate of the \"new\" stuff I'm done with it unless they go back to the old flavor. Awful tasting. \n",
      "Bought this for the sole purpose of making protein pancakes. Love the flavor and it mixes easily. Will def buy again, along with other flavors. \n",
      "I've been taking it for about a week now. It smells much better than any other protein I've ever had. I wish I could say the same about the taste. It's extremely chalky and hard to get down, with both water and especially milk. The actual flavor isn't terrible, but it definitely could be better. On a more positive note, it aids in recovery better than most other products I've used. I take it twice a day, after a workout and either in the morning or at night, depending on my schedule. I don't think I will be buying this again.\n",
      "One of the best tasting protein powders that I have ever tried. The only two that could top it are syntha-6 and Gaspari's intrapro, which I believe is off the market now. For the price, this is unbeatable though. Great deal, great product, great company, and great taste. Will definitely buy again and would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "Well I dont know what Dymatize is trying to do here, but they ruined my favorite protein powder.  They are a sports nutrition company that has supposedly improved a product, but by doing so made it less nutritionally sound.  My life is ministry and health. Improving peoples health is just one way I minister.  I am a professional natural bodybuilder and nutrition coach with a degree in Human Nutrition from Ohio State.  They say it has improved taste, but the old product has no sugar and this new version has 4 grams.  The best time to take it because of the patented extended release is at bed time, but now it has got 4 grams of sugar in it so its never going to be my pre-bedtime shake again.  The taste is no improvement over the old version either!  They definitely took a step in the wrong direction!\n",
      "The \"New Improved\" version of this product is awful. \n",
      "\n",
      "This used to be my favorite protein powder. The new version no longer fits my dietary needs and the taste has become unbearable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Never buying this product in this formulation again. \n",
      "For someone who uses protein powders for an in-between type of use I find this to fit the bill rather well. The price is about half of what other comparably weighted protein tubs are and thus makes this product a good deal. I will continue to use this until I feel I need a change but overall I am a happy customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Addendum - The new formulation does not taste nearly as good as the previous one. The Fudge Brownie has a completely different taste and it's not for the better. \n",
      "Great value and all encompassing protein blend. The flavors are as accurate as I think anyone can reasonably expect from a company. Although I did not like the blueberry muffin as much as the banana nut and fudge brownie, it did taste very similar to the muffin but I don't think that flavor does well as a protein shake.\n",
      "This was my favorite protein. But I just ordered and received two tubs that had a \"New and Improved Taste.\" There are straight up disgusting compared to how they used to taste. Just tastes like floury pancake mix. Especially the Blueberry. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looks like I'll be looking for a new protein. \n",
      "I've been using the product for about a week.  the taste is ok.  the price is great (for someone on a tight budget like me).  not a lot of protein in on scoop.   having said that, comparing to regular casein the main difference I feel is that waking up in the morning, I feel that my muscles are tight (like a slight pump) when I started taking Dymatize XT before bedtime, that doesn't happen with regular casein I used to take.  I do think that my body is getting that continuous protein supply throughout the night.  I can literally feel the difference every morning.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If dymatize would add more protein per scoop to their formula, then I'll rate it higher.  I think it's a great protein powder, but I might have to stick to regular whey protein for that post-workout shake and just take Dymatize XT in the morning (I don't have a schedule that allows for multiple meal times a day) and bedtime.\n",
      "This is a great product , It taste great and mixes well in a blender if you follow the manufactures s****estions on blending time. I like this product for price, and the fact it has a complete amino Acid chain added in big enough volumes to produce results. It also has a small bit of vitamins and only 129 calories mixed with water, carbs are held low but best of all the protein is timed released and a serving really last awhile. Now the down side to some may be that it only has 21 g of protein p/s but for its low cost, I simply add one packet of a box of 30 unflavored Gelatin @ a cost of $2.70 at Kroger  that has 7g p/s to powered skim milk @100 cal.p/10oz. and another 10g p/serving giving me a total of 38 G/ps. The gelatin really thickens it up just like a shake ,mix it with your milk ahead of use in a container and let chill ....\n",
      "This USED to be my go-to, everyday protein blend because it was one of the best tasting proteins on the market. I loved the OLD formula.  I go through over 10lbs a month, so the price point of this product made it that much better.  Since the re-formulation, I have been supremely disappointed in this product.  The \"new improved taste\" is a joke.  The taste of the new formula doesn't even come close to that of the old one. I got 3 of my friends to try the old formula and they loved it too, but that is not the case with this new product. One scoop only mixes with about 4-5oz. of water, a yield more similar to an isolate than a blended protein. To get a full 16-20oz shake I need to use about 2 1/2 scoops compared to one rounded scoop of the old formula.  I buy blended proteins for in between meals or meal replacements, not to have to slam 4oz of liquid (I already buy isolate for this purpose). Unlike its predecessor, this product does not mix well in my opinion. It blends o.k. with very few clumps but produces a frothy, airy texture that is off-putting (whether you use a blender or a shaker cup). The taste is o.k. but I'd give it a 6 compared to a 10 with the old product. Dymatize has really dropped the ball here.  After using this product religiously for over 2 years I'm saddened to say I will no longer use this product. If I could return my last tub of this I would. Overall, I would not recommend this product any longer. It's value is considerably diminished and there are better options out there at a similar price point.\n",
      "Ever since the 'new improved taste', I've been very disappointed in this product. The taste has gotten significantly lower, and the scoop sizes larger. With its good price and flavour, I recommended the old formula to others, but now, I wouldn't purchase again.\n",
      "This stuff was a pretty good bargain when it first came out. They've since re-formulated it. it's claims \"new improved taste\" but I personally think it was better before. Another new side effect from whatever they did to it is make it a really hard to digest. If you don't mind feeling like a hot air balloon all the time, then this stuff is for you! lol I guess I'll be switching brands soon.\n",
      "Banana Nut flavor used to taste like dessert and I couldn't wait to drink. Now, something has changed in the formula and the product tastes like plastic. I liked it so much I ordered 4 at a time and now I'm stuck with plastic tasting powder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord help me get thru these next few months and hopefully fudge brownie tastes better!\n",
      "Awesome Flavor! Favorite protein powder of all time! Very affordable! I'm a continuous fan and buyer! Cannot say favorite enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blueberry Muffin is awesome to add to boxed blueberry muffin mix for a protein punch.\n",
      "As much protein as I supplement I need to make my money stretch. My money goes a lot further with this protein.\n",
      "I'm on my third tub of this with the last one being the New Formula for better taste.  The scoop size increased substantially but the amount of protein stayed the same.  The number of servings decreased per tub.  Something is wrong here.  Carbs are higher now.  It used to contain NO sugar, now there are 4 grams per serving.  And now one of the ingredients in Maltodextrin.  I think they just added a bunch of filler to this product.  Very disappointed.  Check out Nutrex Infusion Black for something similar that looks to have better quality and is reasonably priced!\n",
      "The taste could be better. I only bought the rich chocolate due to the fact that you can alter the taste by adding in peanut butter or other things. As far as the protein and it's benefits go. I love it. I workout twice a day on the weekdays. It has my muscles repaired and ready for whatever. I would use thing product over and over again for the benefits. \n",
      "This is a pretty good protein powder for the price, especially since I bought a 4lb tub and got a 2lb free. The taste on both the Fudge Brownie and Chocolate are good, no big complaints. The ingredient profile is pretty solid as well. Overall a good supp for the $.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried a lot of proteins and this is hands down the best.  The value you get for the blended protein of whey/casein/egg as well as a high leucine and glutamine content cant be outdone.  The texture of this protein is incredibly thick, which makes it good for a stand alone snack rather just blending in liquid shakes.  The taste is also incredible and doesn't taste cheap or fake like many other brands.  The new and improved flavor is really an improvement over the older flavors, but the only negative is they increased the sugar content. Overall though the added sugar is pretty negligible and is a small drawback to a protein powder with an awesome value.\n",
      "Best tasting protein I've ever had by far.  Great mixed with water to make a shake, great with egg whites to make a pudding, and great in protein pancakes!\n",
      "It's very cheap, mixes very easily with water and shaker and it tastes amazing. Problem is, that it mostly contains SOY PROTEIN. Soy protein is derived from GMO and other unnatural garbage that's not designed to be processed by the human body. I'll finish this 2lbs but will not get it again.\n",
      "This is probably the best protein powder i ever had. It has a combinations of powders to make great for anytime use, the flavor surprised me a lot it tasted like chocolate milk without milk! and it has some bcaas and glutamine (pharmaceutical) and its only 31.34 for 61 servings! I highly recommend this product to anybody\n",
      "This is my new favorite at the moment.  Tastes good, mixes great. . . texture is a little different (a little powdery maybe) but it is nice & refreshing after a hard workout - not like some others you have to choke down.\n",
      "The protein mixes very well. Banana nut tastes great! I use it for pancakes, yogurt and in my oatmeal. The Fudge Brownie is just as good. I put that in my coffee, as well as pancakes, shakes etc. The powder does not leave a chalky after taste. \n",
      "It may not be the best protein powder on the market, but you can't beat the price.  Way cheaper then any other protein product and you get results. \n",
      "Overal a good protein, looking for what you pay for.\n",
      "\n",
      "If youre on a budget and looking for good protein this is the stuff. When I first got this protein I took a taste of the powder and it tasted just like the brownie mix you can get at a store. Mixed in water it doesnt actually taste that great, probably around a 4 or 5. But mixed in milk, its incredible!\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesnt mix super well for me, which I dont really mind. Im not always mixing this with milk, so those days I just have to chug it quick. But for the price, with everything this stuff offers, its pretty amazing.\n",
      "I have reviewed the Banana Nut flavor and was very pleased.  And, as I stated I would use again but this time try the Fudge Brownie flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like with the Banana Nut flavor, I have had NO problms mixing up this in a shaker cup. In fact, it is no different than a regular whey shake in terms of mixing.  The Fudge Brownie mixed easier than the Banana Nut and it is DELICIOUS!  I can't get enough of it.  It tastes great in water with one and a half to two scoops and tastes even better with one scoop in a glass of organic milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the nutritional profile, blended protein with added BCAA's.  Great product.  Great value!\n",
      "GREAT FLAVORS, KEEPS YOU FULL, DIGESTION IS ON POINT,AND IF MADE WITH OTHER HEALTHY BENEFICIAL INGREDIENTS....YOU CAN MAKE AWESOME FROZEN YOGURT!!!\n",
      "This is one of the best proteins I've used. Works great for recovery. However, on heavier days, you may want to use two scoops instead of one because this is a blend of different types of protein, not strict whey, so it's not quite as powerful as other whey products. I have used this both after a workout, and before bed and it's worked great. The banana nut flavor is my favorite flavor of protein I've ever had. I literally showed it to my friends because it tastes like banana bread. It's even better if you mix in some oats. The fudge brownie flavor, however, is the nastiest tasting thing I've ever had. The banana nut mixed well, but the fudge brownie did not for some reason. It tasted gross, the consistency was horrible, and it clumped WAY too much, so I was pretty much chewing my shake. I'm going to try the rich vanilla flavor to use for cooking, and we'll see how that goes.\n",
      "Tub shipped to me half full. Consistency is terrible, doesn't mix up well at all. When it does mix up okay, the taste is mediocre. Nothing good is this cheap. Pass on this one!\n",
      "For the price of this product it is a great deal in my opinion.  It is not the best tasting protein but the taste isn't bad either.  The Banana Nut flavor is pretty good but I prefer the Fudge Brownie flavor.    There is a slight chalky after taste but it isn't too bad.  It mixed up well for me.  I used it to make shakes some, but I like to use this product more for making pancakes or mixing in my oats.  When using this product for baking it didn't have the chalky after taste that it does when made into a shake.  Highly recommend this product, especially for the bargain price!\n",
      "Both are really great. They mix up well in the blender and taste great in protein pancakes. With just water in a shaker can be little chalky but flavor is great and can't beat the price \n",
      "\n",
      "I recently opened this product after a May purchase.  (1/13 manufacture date on side of package).  The inner seal was not secured firmly, and the container was less than half empty) Yes, I realize there is settling, but it didn't weigh out either.  (I weighed myself while holding it and without holding it on my digital scale.   Hardly scientific, I realize, but still...) Honestly given the inner seal wasn't tight, I didn't try it at all.   \n",
      "After years of trying tons of brands of different proteins, this is my definite favorite.  IMHO it tastes like banana nut muffin batter.  It's been a long time since I've used a protein that I like enough to drink just for its taste.  I do see negative reviews on it from time to time.  Protein flavors are like ***-----, everybody has got one.  This has a good banana flavor....that's not artificial like many banana flavors.  It finishes with a subtle nutty flavor that gives it that 'baked goods' flavor.  Besides the taste, it does what a protein is supposed to do and it keeps me full much longer than any other I've tried.  Without a doubt my new fave.\n",
      "I have tried a lot of protein powders but this my is favorite. I prefer a protein matrix because it has a better amino profile than a single protein source. Usually they cost more but the price per serving on this is great. I no longer have to buy more then one type of protein supplement because it's all in 1 tub for a awesome price. I will be using this product for a long time to come \n",

      "This gets a 10/10 based on value. Currently this is in my opinion the best bang for your buck. You get a good amount of protein for a really low price. And its a good quality blended protein too. You get some fast acting and slow acting proteins making it a good protein to take at any time. The mixability and the taste are only average, but for me that does not detract from the value. At this price I can take a little extra and not worry about going over budget. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes similarly to casein, very thick, delicious Fudge Brownie flavor!\n",
      "Currently trying out this protein, I have always bought Muscle Pharm Combat Powder, however this one is slightly cheaper and  its .4 pounds more. The macros on this are pretty good to my taste 21g of protein is not so bad especially for the price and amount of protein powder you get. As for mixability, im not sure if thats how its supposed to mix, but when I use my blender bottle it has a powdery taste with both water and milk. It also has these small clumps, my first guess was maybe they were small pieces of nuts, but im not entirely sure. Its because of this that I gave it a 8, as for the taste itself I rate it a 5 just because i dont like the powdery taste, i dont like those small clumps, and not really what i would say delicious taste.\n",

As soon as I started with the Dymatize Protein Powder I started to notice my body getting leaner and leaner. I mix my shakes with cinnamon (for flavor and metabolism boosting aspects), and with crushed ice. It's comparable to enjoying ice cream at any time of the day! I love Dymatize's products, and this one is definitely a notable one!\n",
      "I've had protein &quot;boosters&quot; in my smoothies before and was not a fan of that protein-y taste. This protein supplement tastes awesome and goes down easy. Its a little hard to mix but with enough shaking, it mixes just fine! Fudge Brownie tastes just like chocolate milk. Just ordered vanilla, excited to see what that tastes like!\n",

      " It is a decent protein. Feeds your muscles over a long period which is nice. I had an older formula (or atleast design) my tub was brown, not blue.

      "As a protein blend profile, it looks great, it has all the good sources of protein with controlled calories and carbs. Taste Wise. DISGUSTING!! This is one of the worst protein's I've ever had to drink, it smells like bananas but the taste is closer to vomit. It's very powdery and you'll notice your hand is covered everytime you take a scoop. Wouldn't buy again\n",
      "I am very disappointed in this product because IT TASTES HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!! DOESN'T MIX WELL, GRITTY TEXTURE, CHALKY, STRONG ODOR, DID I MENTION TASTES HORRIBLE??? I'm usually a fan of Dymatize, but in this case, I want my money back. \n",
      "The profile is excellent, the macros are spot on and the taste...ohhhh the taste, unbelievable. Great product.\n",
      "Love this stuff!  A great nutritional profile and the best tasting way to prevent catabolism.  I usually take it before bed, or in some cases when I know I'm going to have to go long stretches without getting a chance to eat.  \n",
      "Remember: it really does what it claims.  Meaning, if you take it mid-day during your regular meal schedule, as a slow burning protein it WILL kill your appetite for hours and can throw you off schedule.  \n",
      "Flavour-wise the Banana-nut is great; the fudge brownie...so-so, more just sweet and reminiscent.  S'****ght if you like that sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product, good profile and mixes well.  Not bad for the price will try the other flavors as well.  \n",
      "Love this! Mixes well and tastes amazing. I mix with a small amount of water and freeze it to make a pudding. Then I add some peanut butter... on a keto diet, it's like HEAVEN!\n",
      "This is my new favorite brand. The flavor is always great, and it blends really well. Fudge brownie is freaking delicious, especially given there's no sugar in it. Can't believe how good it tastes. I love this stuff.\n",
      "My new favorite protein.. it tastes exactly like a blueberry muffin and mixes great with water and almond milk.\n",
      "At first, the taste was chalky and pretty thick. A few days later I got used to it and started to love it more and more. I rly love the taste now, its different than other proteins ive tasted. And the colder it is, the better it tastes.. I drink it before going to bed and it fills me up well. Sometoimes i wake up hungry and sometimes no. I recommend you take it before bed, when ur hungry but dont wanna eat something, this slow digesting/release protein will do the job\n",
      "\n",
      "i start to use this product  cuz it contain blend of  protein but the taste has problem i do not no what is it it need 300 ml water to disolve and it is very thick so i recomend it if look for cheap blend of protein \n",
      "\n",
      "I love the flavor of this protein. I had seen it for a while and been curious.  Finally tried it and LOVED it! Great texture especially when mixed in almond milk. Highly recommend! \n",
      "I mix this with 12 oz of milk instead of the reccomended 10 oz because I like a little thinner consistancy. I use a good shaker bottle with the whisk ball, and even though I repeatedly shook it, it remained a little clumpy. The taste is bareable, but a tiny bit chalky. Drinking this dosen't make me nauseated or sit in my stomach. I'd reccomend the product, and it's a very good value for the money.\n",
      "I purchased this because it contained casein, reasonably priced, and it was the only banana flavored protein that didn't have yellow dye. It does really well as a meal replacement if you can get past the taste and consistency. There is this chemically aftertaste and it's kinda gritty. I let it sit a little longer once to see if it just needed to finish dissolving...it didn't help. So take a dose before bed for some slow digesting protein and the BCAAs. I think I will try another brand next time and just swallow the price. \n",
      "Blends better in a blender instead of a shaker cup! Overall convenient to have a whey protein/casein all-in-one.\n",
      "I have had good results in cutting weight while using this shake, but this will be more of a flavor review because a lot of people are probably questioning it based on the bad reviews. I guess my taste buds are weird because I love the taste of this protein where most people don't. I've ordered it in the past when it was called 12-hour protein and am currently using it right now and it still appeals to me. It is a bit chalky, but that is also another reason I like it because it is different in texture from what I have had in the past. I would definitely at least give it a try because everyone has different taste preferences.\n",
      " Overall, a very good, underrated product.\n",
      " DO not buy ,its crap.\n",
      "\n",
      " The taste of this product is alright, and I like how they &quot;claim&quot; there are fast, medium,slow and pharmaceutically released proteins mixed together! For the price i am not sure of the quality and was really mad about the way it mixed since a blender is not always handy.\n",
      "LOWLOW-CARB LAVA BROWNIE recipe: 3 Tbps egg whites, 1 scoop Dymatize Elite XT Fudge Brownie protein powder, 1 Tsp cocoa powder (to taste), 4-8 drops of Stevia Sweetener(or Splenda equivalent), and 1/4 cup water. Whisk all ingredients with a fork until completely mixed in small bowl. Microwave for approx. 1:20 on high. Center portion of the bowl should still be quite moist, and a bit liquid, so mix and chop it all up to get it all nice and lathered in the sauce thats left. **** thats good. Great quick before-bed snack to top off the day. :)\n",
      "The shake qualities are good. Low in calories, no sugar, and low in carbs. But it has a horrible taste and texture to it. I've put it through blenders, shakers, and even stirred it with a mini whisk. It'l like a healthy chalk. This product seems to work but takes a strong stomach to choke it down.\n",
      "This is my absolute favorite protein. It mixes like any other multi protein with Cassien in it, maybe a little less since it claims to have slow release properties but. I take it before be for the reported length of protein abosorption. It is hard to say exactly what positive effects it has because I take it with a full concert of other supplements throughout my day. All day long I take Dymatize Whey Isolate, also love it, and the standard creatine, vitamins, glutamine, IMR pre-workout, and BCAA's. I look forward to the end of my day to be able to take this with milk before bed. With a 300ml of Milk I feel solid all night and wake up wiht a normal amount of hunger. The taste is fantastic! I am on deployment and bought 6 months worth of supplements, 2 of these and one Fudge Brownie XT. I have not tried the Fudge but really wish I had bought 3 of these, I am not looking forward to running out. I would recommend this as part of anybody's regimen.\n",
      "This protein was recommended to me for it being a complete protein- with both quick release and slow release components. Also, the 'blueberry muffin' flavor, I was told, was 'addicting.' Truth be told, this is a great protein powder. FANTASTIC addition to my oatmeal and eggwhites, (really really good combination.) I also blend it with a scoop of quick-absorbing whey (dairy), unsweetened almond milk, water, and ice for a great recovery or before-bed shake. Its a very very fine powder, which i wasn't expecting (never had/used another pro-powder as fine.)\n",
      "So far I've had, banana nut, blueberry muffin &amp; vanilla, for some reason the vanilla flavor seems to not mix as good as the other 2, taste wise, I prefer the banana nut so far and blueberry muffin 2nd, going to order some fudge brownose soon... ingredient wise, amazing stuff!\n",
      " Excellent flavor. A bit rich though. It does taste like a liquefied brownie (in a good way).\n",
      "Has a pretty good profile and is really cheap. I liked how it is sustained released so its perfect take before bed. Taste wise is not what i expected . I heard it taste really good but in my opinion it really isn't that good. But overall i'll probably buy it again because it has quality ingredients and is really cheap\n",
      "Fudge Brownie tastes great! I'm not a big fan of most chocolate flavored proteins but this is pretty good. I recommend trying this flavor. Will be buying from Dymatize again.\n",
      "First time to rate a product . It tastes so bad I think something might be wrong with it.\n",
      "Great taste!\n",
      "This is my absolute favorite protein. Every flavor I have tried has been great. Makes my choice every morning of what to drink very tough.\n",
      "This is hands down the absolute best protein!!! And I've tried almost everything, it's clean and tasty even with just water, mixes flawlessly every time. Would definitely recommend!! \n",
      "Hands down, the best whey isolate ever made.  It mixes perfectly, even in water.  The flavors are generally spot on.  Birthday cake and orange dreamsicle are amazing, cinnamon bun is also very, very good.  These are very sweet, so i actually prefer to mix with water rather than almond milk or milk.  i can't believe how good they taste when mixed with water.  Usually, I don't like protein mixed with water, but, as I mentioned, I actually prefer mixing ISO 100 with water.  Rocky road was pretty good, but far from the level set by the other flavors.  If you really have a thing for rocky road, I'm sure you'll love it.\n",
      "This protein is 100% my favorite protein! I used to buy optimum nutritions gold standard whey protein but once I tried this I couldn't go back. Flavor is insanely good! Gourmet chocolate is more of a subtle chocolate flavor. Not super strong and sweet like fudge brownie. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a quality protein shake.\n",
      "I love Dymatize, it's great as a post workout protein. It goes down smoothly and recovery feels great. For flavor, Orange Dreamsicle is a taste I will forever remember.\n",
      "Orange Dreamsicle is #Heaven. The taste is amazing.\n",
      "I'm a newbie and this was the second protein drink that I had. Yes it has helped me build muscles. I drank some before my workout and then drank again after my workout. The next day, my biceps had grown and were hard which made me kind of scared because I'm a girl who has never had muscles before. The smell is kind of weird but the taste is actually ok. I would buy this again. I also noticed I felt less sore the next day after drinking this. I received a jar that had little dark brown specks in it. I emailed Dymatize asking about it and they said it was \"scorched sweetener that results in a less than satisfactory taste experience' and ensured that it posed no health risks.\n",
      "I've used this as my exclusive post workout protein shake for two years until recently trying JYM. Dymatize ISO-100 is the highest quality protein for the price that I think you can buy. This also includes nutritional value; the least amount of saturated fats, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sugar. It includes BCAA's and tastes pretty good. I think it tastes a little sweet now that I've tried a few other powders; but the strawberry is super good and overall most of the flavors taste better than other powders IMO, (dymatize uses stevia as a sweetener instead of sugar; and it's kinda sweet especially if you just get done with a workout and want to chug something unsweet....)\n",
      "This is super high quality and the best nutritional protein shake that I've researched and used and that should be important to any bodybuilder or anyone who wants to just be in good physical health. It's more expensive; but I think worth it especially because of the nutritional value. Some other competitors have massive amounts more in cholesterol and saturated fats especially. \n",
      "Hands down the best protein I've ever tried. thought it would have a nasty taste like many other proteins I've had but the taste is amazing! Cinnamon bun is my personal favorite\n",
      "This protein is amazing. It keeps me full for a long time and I feel really energized after I take it. The gourmet chocolate flavor is excellent - I find that the protein shakes I make with this flavor are like a dessert. The strawberry flavor is good but it does taste a little artificial.\n",
      "It was entirely too sweet but at the same time one of the best protein powders I've tasted. I did have to add more milk/water to tone it down though. \n",
      "Awesome. Great tasting, if not the best tasting whey that I've tried. Out of all the other birthday cake flavors that I've tried this Birthday Cake is my favorite. It tastes exactly like the cake you see when you walk past the bakery in a grocery store (icing and all). The Gourmet Chocolate is great as well. It tastes like a rich hot chocolate or chocolate milk (if you've ever had powdered Hersey's chocolate mix, this tastes very similar). I don't want to say chalky, but the Gourmet Chocolate has a certain texture to it, almost like adding malt to a milkshake, which gives it an even greater taste. As for the drink/mix, both flavors mixed extremely well (barely had to shake them), though they do get foamy/frothy after mixing (about 2-4oz of foam depending on shake time). I generally mix 1 scoop of protein with 4oz of Soymilk and 6oz of water (10oz total). Overall, outstanding flavor, definitely recommended. \n",
      "I am lactose intolerant and this protein powder is just awesome..no gas at all.\n",
      "Pure hydrolysed whey protein isolate quality. The taste is fantastic even with just pure water but with milk/soy milk or almond milk its even better, delicious and creamy. The macros are some of the best I have seen even beating ON's Gold Standard whey which has a mix of isolate and concentrate but this is pure hydrolysed isolate and is perfect for quick post workout rapid protein. Got this on offer so the value for money was fantastic for what your getting. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: finished my first tub, made good pure muscle gains and additionally got the birthday cake flavour as there was an offer on. I can comment on the taste, it is VERY sweet, like frosting on a cake sweet, its good for mixing into cottage cheese and baking as it makes it nice and sweet but straight up i would recommend adding more liquid then suggested but it does taste like birthday cake and the macros are even better than the fudge brownie, just a 29g scoop has 25g of protein and 110 calories which is insane!\n",
      "Love this protein. Protein to carb to calorie ratio is great. It gets really really thin though which is kind of a turn off. Theres never anything special to vanilla, but this one taste like nothing. strawberry has a funky after taste, but still good. My favorite meal is greek yogurt with birthday cake protein- tastes like cake batter. \n",
      "This has got to be one of the most gas-inducing powders I've used! I'll stick to my usual Iso-Smooth or NutraBio. Taste isn't bad...but the gas...uggh!\n",
      "This powder is true to taste! Exceptional quality, I'm definitely gonna pick up another one. No clumps, smooth rich texture at exactly 6oz but a little sweet. Cost is a bit high but as they say you get what you pay for, quality! At first I thought it was just cause it was a cereal company \"post\" so you pay for the name, not so! It actually is a great protein compared to others in its class (low cal) straight to the point. \n",
      "This is one of my favorite protein powder! Easy to mix and taste is 10/10. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Very good flavor, and equally easy to mix. The only reason I didn't give ISO-100 a 10/10, is because of the way it mixes. In a shaker cup, it foams up REALLY bad and I have to let it sit for 5 minutes so the foam can settle. The best way to mix would probably be with a spoon. Other than that, its perfect.\n",
      "When they changed the label they also changed the composition of the product.\n",
      "It now has a fake sugary taste to it. I've been drinking this for years and am extremely let down because they said \"New look. Same great products\" when in fact this product is not the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, huge letdown Dymatize. Back to Optimum.\n",
      "This is an amazing protein. Really great profile and some really great flavors. Mixes extremely well and is versatile when it comes to mixing with milk or water. \n",
      "Banana is the best flavor!!!! And this is great for a meal replacement also!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Been on this protein specifically for Post Work out Shake for the past 4 years and love it. However just got my new bottle this month and noticed they changed the label. Unfortunately that's not all they changed.  \n",
      "I compared the two labels and noticed that the serving size went up by 1g from 29g per to 30, so there is 2 less servings in the new bottle.  Also there is 10g more salt , 5g increase of cholesterol, and now the product has <1g of sugar when there was 0 before.  There was a significant decrease in potassium from 160g to now 100. \n",
      "The 25g of protein per serving is the same so it appears overall there is more \"fillers\" being added to the product line.  Very sad to me, but I'm sure the company knows I love the product and will continue to pay the expensive price for good stuff.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Birthday Cake flavor taste like vanilla and caramel mixed together to make a too sweet product. Not my favorite. Orange Dreamsicle is a good representation on the real thing, it's a refreshing twist on the classic protein shake. Gourmet Chocolate is no chocolate bar but it does resemble a chocolate flavor.\n",
      "Like it , pretty Clean Protein. taste is amaizing !! I have been trying diferent isolate proteins and this is by far the best one! \n",
      "I've tried Gourmet Vanilla and Gourmet Chocolate.  The Gourmet Chocolate is good, but I really love the Gourmet Vanilla.  I do not think it is extremely sweet, but reminds me of a Carnation Instant Breakfast.  I most prefer it with Almond Breeze unsweetened almond milk and just a little bit of ice, blended, so it is nice and cold, but not too icy.  I've started adding a 1/2 banana to it for variety, but it is really good without anything additional.  I'm sorry when I've finished the drink.  I'll add that it also works as lunch replacement for me if my workout is late enough in the morning.\n",
      "I really like the results I've gotten with this protein powder. After less than a month of use, I can see a real difference in muscle definition and body fat vs. muscle percentages. I can't speak for the other flavors but the Gourmet Vanilla, in my opinion, is atrociously sweet for a vanilla powder. I use almond milk for my other shakes but I have to mix in something bitter with this one to counteract the sweetness because it's gross by itself. If you have an insane sweet tooth you may like it. However, I did discover that the Gourmet Vanilla is AMAZING with black coffee. It tastes just like vanilla coffee creamer but instead of nasty crap you're drinking whey protein. Great boost in the morning or before a workout, I'd definitely recommend trying it.\n",
      "Over the last few years I have tried all of the top 10 protein shakes. I have read many independent studies of protein powders and amino spiking ,total protein content and fillers. Dymatize is by far the best one. High total protein content (about 86%.) And the flavor is ON POINT! this is now my go to protien.\n",
      "So easy to mix. Even mixes well with a spoon! No clumping at all. Strawberry flavor is pretty dull, but I've been mixing with water so may taste better with milk.\n",
      "This tastes amazing and is easy to mix! \n",
      "awesome new formula\n",
      "Hands down the best whey protein in the market. I love that it is pure isolate and free of junk. Its also easy on the stomach and I've never experienced bloating or other stomach issues compared to other whey proteins. The best part is it tastes great!  Luckily I have been able to try all of the flavors and Birthday Cake is the most amazing flavor in my opinion. I can't get enough of it wether it be mixing it in a shake, making ice cream out of it or having it with my morning oatmeal. I love that it tastes great without having added sugar or fat. My top 3 flavors are 1. Birthday Cake 2. Orange Dreamsicle 3. Fudge Brownie. Fudge Brownie tastes similar to the new Rocky Road flavor. The only flavor I have complaints about are the strawberry which tastes very bitter and bland. Otherwise all of them are good and I would definitely recommend this brand.  \n",
      "Solid protein powder. A little bit pricey but certainly high quality. Mixes well and tastes even better.\n",
      "First time using ISO�100. The Birthday Cake Flavor is amazing, I tried it with milk and it mixes real good no clumps. I've also tried it with nonfat plain Greek yogurt and it's like birthday cake pudding, Awesome!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Update(8/30/16) Rocky Roads flavor was okay, it's still good but Gourmet Chocolate is still the best chocolate flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "This ISO is as advertised; clean, fast-acting and full of the finest ingredients money can buy. Mixes easier than anything else I've tried and tastes as good as Muscletech's Platinum Isolate. A premium hydrolyzed isolate and my current reference. Compared to ON, it's as good, but mixes better, tastes better and is a few dollars cheaper. What else can you ask for??!!!! \n",
      "Great taste and mixes very well. \n",
      "     I recently bought a 3lb tub of the Birthday Cake flavor and was very satisfied. I'm extremely lactose sensitive so I chose to go with the hydrolyzed isolate and was very satisfied; no problems on that end. The only complaint I have would be with the flavor. It was almost too sweet, to the point where I often found myself throwing PB2 in the mix just to cut it a bit. I'm not sure if it is this flavor exclusively or all of them. I've ordered Fudge Brownie and it should be here soon, so I will review again then.\n",
      "     Still going with 9/10 because minus the sweetness quirk which is all personal preference anyway, it is still hands down the best protein supplement I've ever used.\n",
      "     Edit*** Been using Fudge Brownie a couple weeks now and it has the same problem. I think it's just the artificial sweetener. To me, artificial sweeteners have a very specific taste and it comes out fairly strong with the ISO-100. A bitter-sweet flavor that's hard to describe. I'll edit again when I try another flavor. I'll go something fruity next.  Oh! And I'm giving this flavor an 8, because it's just deep chocolate. Nothing \"brownie\"-like stands out.\n",
      "\n",
      " I have try a lot of Protein on the market and i can tell this is the Best you can have if you take this you will have good result with it and now for the taste the Gourmet Chocolate taste a little bit too Sugary but for the Fudge Brownie is the best taste Ever for a shake buy it you will not regret and you will never take no Other shake After you will want this Forever !!!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's too sweet!!!\n",
      "I love this protein! It is the only one that doesn't upset my stomach because it is lactose/gluten free! It tastes amazing, mixes very well in water and my oatmeal, and it has only 1g carb! :-)\n",
      "Just tried Dymatize ISO-100 2 days ago after my workout.  The taste is good although it is a bit sweet for fudge brownie.  No bloating of tummy as it is lactose free which suit me.  This should be my go-to brand for post-workout shake beside ON Gold Standard 100% Whey.\n",
      "I love all of the Dymatize protiens I've tried and this one is the best for quick absorption.  I take it right after lifting weights.  As far as protein powders go, I've tried a lot of them, and Dymatize is the only one I buy now for quality, price, and especially taste.  \n",
      "hands down the best protein! Fudge brownie taste amazing. Cookies and cream is awesome too. Honestly, I haven't had a flavor that I didn't enjoy. I'm a huge fan of Dymatize ISO and casein protein.\n",
      "Definitely my favorite low carb protein. I know this is a wild concept but the Fudge Brownie flavor tastes just like a Fudge Brownie hah! I don't feel bloated or anything after the shake. Definitely still feel light but full. Totally satisfied and highly recommend. \n",
      "For me this is one of the most clean for the price and the taste is amazing.  I usually get two 5 gallon buckets so i don't run out. Enjoy this flavor is the best also no chalky or powdery taste.\n",
      "This product was  what everyone said. I have been working out about a year. I focus more on weight lifting, minimal cardio. I work out about 1 hr/30-2 hrs every at least 5 days a week.  I was looking for a way to get more protein in my diet, without needing to eat as much .. and hopefully see some gains lol.  But I like to keep my carbs low because those tend to get out of control LOL. 1g of carb per serving can't beat that. It is VERY sweet, I only added water.. and one full scoop in the OZ instructed on the bottle. Normally I have an issue with protein powders being to chalky or too bland . Surely not the case with this one. I am satisfied, but I want a new flavor.. maybe chocolate or something.\n",
      "One of the best protein shakes around.  Mixes easily with no lumps or after-residue.  The taste and consistency is simply amazing, you have to try it to really appreciate it!\n",
      "This has been an excellent choice. The taste is good without tasting too sweet. It mixes easily in water but of course taste better with milk.  I like the low calroie amount at only 110 per serving and with only 1 scoop.  Ive bought this product twice for not just the taste but great price too. Highly recommended. Looking forward to trying other flavors!\n",
      "\n",
      "I like that is tastes really good with water on the go. Especially for a sweet tooth. For baking as well. I like the low carbs and I don't end up feeling bloated afterwards. I make a lot of different treats with this so I buy too often.\n",
      "This is one of the best proteins i have found, reminds me of a strawberry milkshake.\n",
      "Depending on what the rest of my meals have been like through the day this can get a bit sweet however.\n",
      "\n",
      "1000% Fav protein\n",
      "I've tried quite a bit of protein powders in my life and dymatize is my #1 choice.  Not only are the   ingredients top notch and macros amazing, the taste is the best.  I have tried these 3 flavors above and all are the best tasting out of any protein i have tried in their respected flavors.  The flavors are sweet, and versitile.  Orange dreamsicle is amazing in a shaker cup with ice coffee and a little milk.  The best iced coffee you will have.  These are pure isolates and are by far the best mixing proteins.  A spoon in a glass is all you need.  its the only protein i have used that you can do that.  Awesome for sludges and baking.  10/10\n",
      "Ive tried a ton of other chocolates.  this is my go to protein powder. can't wait to try other flavors\n",
      "Taste Soooo Goood! I recommend this product! :) \n",
      "Always avoided this product because of the cost, definitely worth every penny!\n",
      "\n",
      "tested through a few proteins and this by far was the best one, easiest  to drink, with hard work you get great results .  it mixes the best in my opinion and has key essentials to building muscle. hydrolyzed is the way to go.\n",
      "This is the only protein that I take. To me nothing compares to this one. \n",
      "Are you thinking about trying the orange dreamsicle? I say you should ABSOLUTELY try it! Order it. I was on the fence about ordering this particular flavor but I just tried it and it's absolutely satisfying. I actually want to drink more of it than what my meal plan allows. Lol \n",
      "Bodybuilding.com thank you for the amazing products you guys provide us access to via your website!\n",
      "This is by far my favorite fast absorbing protein powder. Good for shakes, smoothies, and baking. Mixes so well that you don't even need to use a shaker bottle, you can literally stir it in with a spoon. Strawberry is by far the most natural flavor offered. Shake it with milk and it's like you are a kid again drinking strawberry Nesquik. Going to try birthday cake for the first time.\n",
      "mixes very good and smooth. dymatize got awsome tastes, though cinnamon bun was not as good as i expected it has a very strong after tase\n",
      "This is by far my favorite protein for mornings when I first wake up, post workout shakes, and baking. The ingredient profile speaks for itself, and the flavor is the best out of any protein I've tried, especially the cinnamon bun! The gourmet chocolate flavor was okay, but still better than most other whey proteins out there! I highly recommend this one!\n",
      "Best ISO on the market and best tasting\n",

      "Birthday Cake wasn't that good at all. Tastes really bad for me. Might be more delicious for other people.\n",
      "Absolutely love the product. The only minus for me is that the taste kind of reminds me of vanilla flavor which I can't stand :( But still better than vanilla :D\n",

      "The flavor is excellent, easy to mix. I use it at any time, especially before bed , without affecting my sleep time.\n",
      "I've used a few protein powders in the past (ON, Arnold, MuscleTech etc) and by far this one is the best. It mixes very good, even when just using a spoon. I'm a chocolate guy, so I only have tried the chocolate gourmet flavor, and the taste is great. I mix mines with water. It taste like hot cocoa minus the hot. It has added BCAA's also. Plus fat, sugar, carbs is very low. The only thing, us the price, but for a hydrolyzed whey protein, you'll have to pay for the cost. Since it's the purest form of whey protein. I would probably wait for a sale, if You worry about the cost. Other than that, it is great. I have seen great lean muscle mass gains from using it.\n",
      "Great isolate shake.  Tastes good, but gets foamy after mixing and shaking.\n",
      "I bought the birthday cake flavor to use in a protein cake batter recipe and decided to try it as the actual shake. As I was drinking it, I thought to myself \"this isn't protein. This is a dessert.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, so good. Buy it!\n",
      "The best tasting protein that's out on the market hands down! Definitely a must buy and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great product. \n",
      "This protein flavor purchase was beaded on the ratings that it received. I was a little skeptical about Orange Cream, since protein powders are usually known for vanilla or chocolate. Most attempts stay within that realm. I took a chance and it paid off, the flavor is amazing. So nice to have a different flavor protein shake to be able to mix it up from the normal, every day flavors. Dymatize does it again! I highly recommend this product and flavor. Try it for yourself.\n",
      "Just picked this stuff up this week from BB.com. Oh man, its AWESOME. \n",
      "It mixes really well (using cold water), no clumping at all.  The taste is amazing, I can seriously drink this stuff all day long. I just might, :)  I was using Syntha-6 and Muscle Tech, but as of right now I think I am switching to Dymatize, orange Dreamsicle.  Will be buying a 5lb tub next time there is a sale.  \n",
      "The absolute best I have tried, taste and performance. It is a bit more expensive though.\n",
      "If you have the extra money to spend and taste is as important as performance this is the product to get. Little to no bloating, instant mixing even with a spoon.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Good taste ! never tried any other protein but this is quit ok\n",
      "Orange dreamsicle is the best flavor protein I have ever tasted, not too sweet like other company's absurd flavors, so you are able to get it down easily after a hard workout. Birthday cake is awesome as well! Great product and highly recommend!\n",
      "Absolutely love this protein powder. Was recommended by my best friend. Have only tried the gourmet chocolate but looking forward to trying other flavors in the future. I mix with almond milk or non fat milk and use it as a meal replacement usually for breakfast and post work out.  Other proteins I have tried do not taste as good, clump easily. I will be sticking with this brand! \n",
      "I blend it with my nutri blender. It is the best tasting protein shake I ever had. I don't like chocolate at all, but this I love. It does not foam up like the other once when I blend it. Love it!!\n",
      "Best protein ever.  Great taste. Amazing results\n",
      "When i look at a protein powder, I am looking for grams of protein vs grams of carbs, how easy it is to mix, and flavor. Since i'm a carboholic and have absolutely no problem getting the required carbs needed in a day, i really like that this only has 1 g of carbs per serving vs 25 g of protein. The flavor of this one, while a little sweet for my liking, is a nice change from my standard chocolate. As far as mixability, this stuff is amazing. l don't need a blender or blender ball. Water, powder, shaker cup, and go. It's smooth. No chunks. Awesome!\n",
      "If you're looking for great flavor, this is definitely it.  If you're looking for a great protein, this is ALSO it.  Just all around a great protein.\n",
      "The best protein!!!!! \n",
      "Amazing product! I love mixing my powders with other foods and/or baking with them and this one is perfect for satisfying your sweet tooth. As usual, Dymatize makes an incredible, great tasting, quality product!\n",
      "This is by far one of the cleanest protein powders I've ever used. And I've used many during my fitness journey! I would recommend ANY of these flavors.\n",
      "Let me just start out this review by saying I absolutely HATE the taste of protein powders. I have tried so many different ones over a few years and have never been satisfied. THIS PROTEIN IS AMAZING!!! The birthday cake flavor is delicious, no words, delicious. I recommend this product to people who don't like the taste of protein. It is so satisfying and just incredible. Thank you Dymatize, and thank you Bodybuilding.com!\n",
      "Great low carb/low calorie protein.  Highly recommend!  This is one of the best protein investments you can make and gives you that quick Isolate Whey protein and the flavoring is second to none.  Really enjoyed the Birthday Cake and would highly recommend.   The Cinnamon Bun which is exclusive to bb.com is delicious.  New breakfast go to protein as i am starting to hit fasted am cardio and this really kills the hunger until I reach work and can eat an actual meal.\n",
      "Chocolate is the best tasting.  Great macro profile.  birthday cake tastes ridiculous.  Vanilla is a bit too sweet but nice to mix with other things.\n",
      "This is now my go to protein. I love the flavor, I love that Dymatize is all about quality and science. They make a product that is above the rest in terms of taste, macro balance, and one that I trust has what is on the label in the product. \n",
      "By far this is the best tasting protein I've ever tried and let me tell me you I've tried a lot of different types of protein. I can take it right before i work out and i wont feel full or blowded. It mixes well with water it taste just like the Orange Dreamsicle ice cream. This by far is now my favorite protein. \n",
      "This protein tastes amazing.. I ordered Orange Dreamsicle and it tastes exactly like a orange dreamsicle milkshake. Its pretty incredible considering I drink it with water. I know the ingredients are very clean, so with this taste this product is an A+. This is a must buy! Top level stuff.\n",
      "Birthday cake is hands down my favorite. It's got a sweetness to it which helps with my cravings. All flavors mix great and taste is incomparable. Cinnamon Bun is also tasty, and not over powering on the cinnamon. Orange dreamsicle tastes exactly like the orange push pops we had as kids :) mix the orange and vanilla for an even better experience for the taste buds ;) \n",
      "The vanilla flavor tastes great. When mixing with cold water it mixes okay. When mixing with hot water it clumps up very easily and hard to put down. \n",
      "Decent product and taste.\n",
      "After research and reading reviews I decided to give Iso 100 a try because of how pure and great tasting they say it was.. I ordered the cookies and cream flavor. Ever since then this is my go to protein! It's taste reminds me of a creamy milkshake I feel like it's my cheat meal 👌🏾. Just *** water and that's it! I have noticed that my recovery it'd quick and im not sore as much as I used to be. Before taking it I would be sore 4-6 days but now it's only a day! I recommend this protein 100%! 10/10 I just bought the Orange Dreamsicle let's see how it tastes! \n",
      "Cleanest, and best tasting protein I have ever had - Will never change it up either.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an excellent powder. The birthday cake flavor is one of my favorites of all time. The macros of this powder are perfect with hardly any fat, very low carbohydrates, and high in protein. The taste of this powder is excellent. I tried the birthday cake but I will definitely be trying some of their other flavors in the future. The texture is nice and thick even when mixed with just water and the mixability is excellent when using a skaker bottle. The whey isolate is very fast digesting and I feel that I recover quicker after I take it. Dymatize is one of the best protein companies out there and doesn't spike their protein with amino acids or other junk. The powder does not taste chalky or artificial when compared to some other powders. This is an excellent product and deserves a 10/10. I will definitely purchase more in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mostly want to comment on taste and digestibility with this....   i have a sensitive stomach and am a bit lactose intolerant....   this formula does not cause nausea or gas at all (i do not trust Amazon anymore for any protein powder products, i have had several bad batches of Elite powder that made me ill, i'm hoping/guessing bodybuilding.com is more trustworthy regarding expiration and such). anyway... I can drink it first thing in the morning and workout soon after with no fear of it coming back up, like i might with other things i eat/drink.     I have only tried two flavors.   The fudge brownie, which i can drink without gagging....i'm a wuss with taste.    the Orange Dreamsicle i actually really enjoy though!   I don't think it too sweet.   it's just right for me!   I'm really happy i finally found protein powder that actually tastes good (i still wouldn't want to drink it as i would the strawberry lime energy powder stuff from ON..so yummy!, but as far as protein powders go, this is the best!\n",
      "Awesome Protein!\n",
      "The birthday cake flavor is amazing usually I drink it with milk and it blends in seconds compared to other protein that get lumpy with the milk. Great product sure to continue buying\n",
      "This protein is easily one of my favourites. High quality of protein to scoop rate, low fats, sugars and carbohydrates I would high recommend this product to people who want to lean. Bought Gourmet Chocolate - not the greatest - bit dry. Now have Cookies and Cream - which is a great flavour. Superb service from Bodybulding .com - free delivery - which is very very fast and quick. Ordered 7/4/16 - received my protein the very next day!\n",
      "Iso-100 has always and will continue to be my go-to protein. It's top of the line and it gets the job done. Their flavor's are always so smooth. With the 'Orange Creamesicle' flavor, it brings me back to my childhood and it tastes EXACTLY like the Creamesicle pops I had as a kid. You guys nailed it as always 10/10.\n",
      "Best chocolate flavor I've ever had. Mixes well with milk or water and I've even given samples out to my coworkers because they love it too. Just purchased the Birthday Cake flavor so I have high hopes!\n",
      "I've tried many Protein powders over the years.  Most have what I call that \"Chalke\" taste and it doesn't dissolve completely in liquids.  This is my 3rd go around with the Dymatize ISO-100 products...I call it the gift that keeps on giving.  I love the taste, I've had Vanilla and Cookies & Cream (I like the Vanilla slightly more).  I kind of analogize this product with the old Milk commercials that were in print ads and TV...you know...\"Milk does a body good\", well, without a doubt, I feel that my body receives total replenishment from this product.  I do doubles as far as workouts within a day and they are pretty intense. I leave it all in the gym.  I really look forward to having my protein shake after my workout, if I have to be addicted to something, it might as well be something for my health.  Using this product along with the stack that I take, I feel that it is putting me closer to my goals of optimum health...I highly recommend Dymatize ISO-100 Protein powder.  \n",
      "My go to protein on prep! low carbs and a great flavor!\n",
      "Iso-100 is by far my favorite brand! I love the cinnamon bun and fudge brownie are the best. These shakes aren't as thick as some of the others I have tried but they mix well with anything, milk, cashew milk, almond milk, and water. The smooth banana was a little disappointing I didn't think it had much of a banana flavor! But I have been impressed with Dymatize Iso 100 from the first time I have tried it!! I definitely have a fudge brownie shake at least once a day!!!!\n",

The orange dreamsicle is so good and mixing it with milk makes it taste exactly like you're drinking a milkshake. The only thing is that it gets really foamy after shaking, but I usually will just stick it in the fridge for a few minutes to let it settle and get a little colder. The cinnamon bun however, was actually the most disgusting thing I have ever tried in my entire life. It had such a chemical taste to it that neither my boyfriend or I could really get it down. I don't know if i just got a bad batch but I'm stuck with 5lbs of garbage. My advice- orange dreamsicle: yes!! cinnamon bun: NO\n",

      "Great taste and mixes well.  Goes good with pancakes in the batter or as a thicker frosting.  Low fat and low carb.  Only downside is the price.  Best to purchase when there is a sale.\n",
      "great taste and mixing. really helped me gain lean muscle. It mixes great with yogurt on breakfast. \n",
      "This protein powder was recommended by my coach. It has given me incredible fat loss results and is delicious and filling.It has an excellent reputation for being the purest ! \n",
      "Great formula, great taste, easy mixing.\n",
      "I enjoy it, never tried hydrolyzed whey protein before. \n",
      "Cinnamon Bun is my favorite. Good price for such quality product. Using it as post workout and I am feeling it helps. I recommend it. \n",
      "I really love this protein - the ratio of protein/carbs to calories is perfect for my fitness goals. I love the flavor. It tastes great added to shakes, protein pancakes, baking, or just with water in a shaker. It's smooth, never chunky, mixes well and taste fantastic. High quality product. Will buy again!\n",
      "So delicious, my favourite protein powder by far. I love the taste and never get sick of this flavour.  \n",
      "Great tasting hydro protein that I take immediately after any workout, hydro gets absorbed quicker compared to regular protein. Taking hydrolised whey makes such a big difference compare to whey isolate for post-workout, but ISO-100 didn't make that much more difference because I already used to take ON Platinum Hydro, but it tastes much better and in turn always made me more motivated in the gym because I know there's a delicious shake waiting for me at the end :)\n",
      "Absolutely the best protein I had use since I changed my life into fitness style. Easy to mix, clean, low carb, gluten free and low calorie. Oh and the taste : amazing ! This is all I need to my pos workout ! \n",
      "The protein itself is a great product, but BEWARE OF THE FLAVORS, I tried gourmet chocolate for the first time, it actually tastes pretty good (moderate sweetness), after I finished the chocolate flavour I decided to pick any other flavor since they \"all taste great\", but fudge brownie flavor does disappointed me because be far it is the worst protein shake I have ever used, the intense bitter taste stays in mouth lasts centuries after I finished. I would never ever buy the fudge brownie flavor from dymatize\n",
      "WOW, Best tasting shake found yet. Don't think it could get any better than what ISO-100 offers. Gourmet Chocolate mixed with water tastes just like my favorite childhood drink NesQuik. I never was too concerned with the taste or really looked forward to drinking any protein shake because I wasn't drinking it to please some sweet tooth but this ISO-100 will do it. Mixes well with water, absolutely no powder clunking on the shaker bottle. \n",
      "Protein's taste is AMAZING!!! especially when mixed with almond milk. protein profile content is up to my standards. will def buy again.\n",
      "I normally use cookies and cream of most proteins so when I swapped to this brand I ordered my go to flavor.  I also ordered the chocolate and fudge brownie.   Now both the chocolate and fudge where very good, the cookies and cream was amazing.  Its hands down the best cookies and cream flavor of any other brand I have tried before.  Its a 10/10, the other 2 flavors i give a 8/10. They were good but wow that cookie flavor is awesome. \n",
      "This is the best protein I have tried ever. I've seen the best gains with this stuff (without packing on extra fat), it mixes well with no clumps, and tastes great. I would recommend it to anyone and will continue to use it for a long time!\n",
      "Holy protein, Batman!  This ISO-100 is absolutely everything I was dreaming of.  I have used many protein powders and this one is the best tasting, best mixing, and feels great in my stomach.  The gourmet chocolate tastes to me better than chocolate milk.  That isn't really a good comparison because ISO-100 is smoother than chocolate milk and tastes better!  So, put down the chocolate milk and mix some of this up with some 2% and you will thank yourself and Dymatize!  This will now be my go to source for post workout and intermediary protein needs throughout the day and on off days.\n",
      "I LOVE Dymatize ISO 100, the flavors are awesome.  A quarter scoop of cinnamon swirl with just a tiny bit of water to form a paste is awesome on toast to make it like a cinnamon bun.  Fudge brownie is my new favorite, I love mixing it with some Greek yogurt.  Orange Dreamsicle reminds me of Orange Julius.  Love that one in the morning.  Gourmet Chocolate is super chocolaty without an artificial taste.  Not listed here is Chocolate Mint which is only available in the 10lb box.  That one reminds me of Andies Candies.  Really tasty.\n",
      "Great Flavor but requires at least 10 oz of water or it is too sweet. Mixes very easily. Nice flavor variations when blended with various fresh fruit or added milk for extra protein.\n",
      "I ordered the cinnamon bun powder in the 3 lb bucket and then I ordered it in the 5 lb bucket. The 5 lb bucket tastes HORRIBLE!!! It tastes NOTHING like the 3 lb bucket and I don't understand why! I would REALLY like to return it because I am not satisfied with the taste at all and it costs waaay to much to dislike!\n",
      "Excellent macros, mixes well, generous serving size and the taste is superb!!! This is also my favorite protein to cook with. My protein pancakes come out perfect every time, where as some other brands get too dark or just taste odd after being heated. Cannot say enough good things about it! \n",
      "the taste was very good. There was no odd after taste. of course you have to make sure that you are mixing it with the correct amount of water/milk (i use water). If you use too little, it starts to taste a bit strong and you begin to taste the chemical (ish). if too much, tastes like a watery chocolate milk. the perfect amount, makes it taste perfect. \n",
      "This is a great protein, good macros and great quality. It is a little pricey though and probably not worth it unless you really need an isolate. I got the cinnamon bun which was...interesting. It tastes exactly like a cinnamon bun, but it is INCREDIBLY sweet. And im not one to usually say something is sweet but this actually hurt my teeth at times. I got it to put in oatmeal and while it was edible it wasnt that great. I'm still giving it a 9 though because it is the first protein that ive been able to drink and enjoy in water. I usually use skim milk but there was almost no difference between water and milk which was incredible to me. Bottom line, if you cant handle sweet stuff, dont get this but if you can its quite good.  \n",
      "OMG! The flavor, the flavor, the flavor. I have tried several chocolate flavors of various brands. This one beats all -- hands down. And I love that the carbs are not high!! Big plus for me. I use this as my go to protein drink. Before and after training and when I need a protein snack. I use it to make my 'pudding' .  Greek yogurt, cocoa, and Gourmet Chocolate!! No need to add a sweetener!! This powder is all I need!! YUM\n",
      "Taste more wonderful\n",
      "This flavor tastes awful. It has an awful after taste. I bought the 5 lb and regretted choosing this size. I should've bought a tester or tried a sample before. Otherwise, this protein is good but avoid this flavor. Now, I have to finish it even if it testes awful. X(\n",
      "By far the best tasting protein out there, with nearly no carbs. I hate to share awesome dreamsicle is because when it is on back order my life is horrible. So I always have an extra jug now just in case. It tastes just like an Orange Julius, it's a daily addiction. \n",
      "\n",

      "This protein is simply great. \n",

      "I have tried Cellucor Protein in the past, and switched over to Dymatize after a fitness trainer recommended it to me as a substitute. I am glad that I did, I have no negative comments about my time cellucor, I love their products, however I have seen great and fast results with Dymatize iso 100 protein powder and the results are amazing. Especially if you are working out in the gym regularly, my muscles are coming in nicely and my recovery time is fast. I also love the taste, especially the birthday cake, at times it can be a tad sweet but the taste is great and I usually blend with a banana and almond milk or water. The texture is great and blends well. \n",
      "Mixes very easily, and tastes great... Like an Orange Julious!\n",
      "\n",
      "Trying a new protein powder is always a bit of a gamble. I've spent hundreds on yucky ones that sat on the shelf for months before eventually ending up in the trash. Dymatize Iso-100 did not disappoint! My ONLY complaint is that the texture was a little thicker than I would like...a simple fix by adding more liquid. The flavor is awesome!\n",
      "This product may be better than a 5 rating as a protein supplement but I just cannot get over how horribly, sickly sweet it is to give it any more (I am on the fence of giving it less).  The taste of the fudge brownie and the birthday cake flavors are so sweet--and I have a sweet tooth--that I am having to use half servings and, even then, trying to cut it with things like unsweetened cocoa powder or unflavored whey isolate to dilute it enough to try and get it down so I can use up the supply I purchased.  Other flavors may be more tolerable but I don't see myself spending the cash on them to try and find out.  It has been difficult enough stomaching this lot already. \n",

When you open the container its actually like opening a brownie mix box. Smells so good! Ok so the new flavor OMG!! great taste found a new winner!! And great low sodium and low carbs!! Win!

The chalky, gel like, bad tasting proteins out there are no joke. You spend a bunch of money and then feel like you have to drink them because nothing seems to taste good, so they must all be like this. Well, no. Dymatize's ISO whey tastes fantastic. You wouldn't know you are having a protein shake, if someone didn't tell you. I don't even need to use milk with it half the time. It tastes great even with water and ice. I would recommend this to anyone. \n",

      "I have a sweet tooth so Birthday Cake Flavor is the best for me. I'm also Lactose intolerant so this works well on my stomach. I would like to try out the Cinnamon and Vanilla Flavor next. I tasted orange dreamsicle flavor and that did not taste well at all.  \n",
      "Love Dymatize! Great taste and It helps with my sweet tooth. Brings a smile to \n",
      "my face every time :) Thank you Dymatize! Can you please, maybe come up with\n",
      "pina colada or dark chocolate mint! You guys rock! \n",
      "I'm currently on my second tub and I really like this stuff!  You can read the label yourself to see that it's a solid product.  From a taste perspective, I've tried both Fudge Brownie and Gourmet Chocolate and both are very easy to handle.  I tried Fudge Brownie first and found it very clumpy and difficult to mix with water and spoon in a cup.  I would have to shake it very thoroughly in a shaker to get it mixed well enough to drink. Once I did though it was fine.  I went a different direction this time though and got Gourmet Chocolate and found that I can't use it in a shaker at all as it is a much finer powder and foams EXTREMELY bad. I can however mix it with about 10oz water in a cup and it does just fine.  From a taste perspective, they're both very tolerable although I think I prefer the Fudge Brownie of the two.  The Gourmet Chocolate almost has a coffee like taste to it and as a non-coffee drinker I don't care for that. Great product!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is / was my go to protein over the past 2 years.\n",
      "I totally love it and I cant imagine why there are so few flavours left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please restock them fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: pretty much the best and for me the easiest protein to digest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would totally recommend thiss !\n",
      "It mixes well with water!  Not too sweet.  Good selection of flavors.  And I'm liking the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd rate my lactose intolerance 8 out of 10, 10 being the worst and this is by far the best whey isolate I found so far, it gives me zero problems with digestion. Chocolate flavor is amazing, although I'd prefer a bit less sweet. Mixability is fine.\n",
      "Great product. Easy to digest.\n",
      "Gourmet chocolate is a great flavour and keeps temptations away\n",
      "ISO-100 is a killer isolate, but Gourmet Vanilla is an awful flavor.  Stick with chocolate or Cookies and Cream for a lighter shake.\n",
      "This is my favorite protein powder I have found. I have only tried the chocolate and vanilla but they are both delicious. My friend swears by the birthday cake flavor. I love that it is lower carb than other brands as well. I drink it in shakes with water and almond milk and it tastes like a milk shake. I also love using it in recipes- homemade protein bars, etc. I highly recommend! \n",
      "Best tasting vanilla protein powder hands down.\n",
      "Been using this ISO protein for about 2 weeks now. The taste is pretty good but I've had better. I also was mixing it with 7-8 oz of water at first and it was very watery. I almost dreaded drinking it. Usually I look forward to my protein shake but not this time. So I cut it back to 5-6 oz and it's better but then taste too sweet and concentrated. Overall it's a quality product but I just can't get the consistency/taste to where I like it. I will buy again but in a different flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was unsure how I would like this product, especially since I am used to other protein blends. The flavor was great and not overwhelming at all. It mixed very well with my coconut milk. The only negative I had about this product was that it comes in a larger container but when you open it is only half full with powder. That really was only the bad thing I have to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "A nice flavor, too sweet in my opinion, but still great!\n",
      "The chocolate flavor is spot on !! If you like chocolate this is the one for you !! And it is not quite as sweet as the Gourmet Chocolate flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein is great! Very low on sugar, only 1 gram. Also no fillers and no spiked ingredients such as additional BCAA's. BCAA occurs naturally in a hydrolyze whey isolate proteins. Mixes nicely in a shaker cup. I usually buy in the 5 pound tub when it is on sale because it average priced at about $13.99 per pound. \n",
      "Use this protein while I'm cutting because it's a bit cleaner than most. Flavors are top notch and aren't over the top sweet. Definitely a good buy\n",
      "Ran out of ON Gold Standard Whey and thought I'd give this a try, and it was okay but the flavor I got was dang near unbearable. Wayyyyyy too sweet. I like sweet stuff, but this was sweet n a bad way. I wanted to return it but couldn't find the receipt. Maybe try out this product…just not birthday cake…yuckkk. Back to Gold Standard….\n",
      "I really wanted to like this but just couldn't.  I rated it highly because I really liked the ingredients/formula of this supplement and what it has to offer; however, I couldn't stomach the flavors of the ones I tried.  For me, the flavor was really strong and overpowering; though the flavors were true to form, they were really strong - like drinking cake batter or melted ice cream.  I tried cooking/baking with these also, but it didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped for.  As others have stated, this produces a thicker consistency drink than some other powders (again, sort of like melted ice cream).  Overall, I would recommend this product to others, but warn them about the flavoring.  \n",
      "I've tried dozens of protein brands and probably close to a hundred flavors over the years. Nothing I've found tastes better than Dymatize-100 Gourmet Chocolate and Orange Dreamsicle. I can't adequately put into words how delicious Orange Dreamsicle is. Most protein flavors taste kind of like the thing they say they taste like. But this flavor tastes EXACTLY like I took an Orange Dreamsicle pop and melted it into a glass. It's so good. Plus, the Macros on these are absolutely fantastic. Not to mention that even on days I'm traveling for work and need 3 shakes to hit my protein goal, Dymatize is easier on my digestive system than the other isolates I've tried. I can't recommend these flavors enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the Vanilla, it tasted good, but not great. About the same as other vanilla protein powders I've had. The cookies and cream tasted way, way too sweet at first, but it grew on me. Probably won't be getting it again, but I can see people with a sweet tooth liking it. \n",
      "Most delicious low carb whey I have ever tasted.  Birthday cake is amazing.  I mix with greek yogurt strawberries and ice.  It tastes like a strawberry shake \n",
      "I have been taking this for over a month now consistently post-workout and definitely see the gains. I've only tried \"Fudge Brownie\" but tasted good, mixed well without any clumps. Hoping to see a sale on it soon because I'm almost done with it. I recommend this whey-protein.\n",
      "It tasted great. It was easy to mix. I would order it again!\n",
      "This is the smoothest tasting protein shake I have ever taken and the Orange Dreamsicle flavor is like having an Orange Julius even with just water!  If anyone is looking for a shake and a flavor that will make you want to drink it regardless of time and place, then this is the one to get.\n",
      "Gourmet Chocolate is phenomenal!! I tried it with water alone and it reminded me of Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa but this is much more delectable.  I can not wait to make hot chocolate with this protein powder this fall. Birthday cake was alright. It had a nice sweetness to it but I probably won't order it again.\n",
      "The cake batter and fudge brownie are awesome they both taste great.  They mix very well a few shakes in the shaker cup and your good to go.  The strawberry is also good I'm just more of a chocolate guy, I really didn't like the gourmet chocolate it just didn't seem chocolatey enough lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to flavor, I have found Fudge Brownie to blow the other flavors out of the water in the Iso-100 line-up. While perhaps not the best taste for plain powder-and-water shakes, it is fantastic when mixed into anything (brownies, cookies, proats, sludges (with a casein base), etc.). The Gourmet Chocolate flavor, while not unpleasant, is a bit sweet and milky for my liking. The Cinnamon Bun flavor was far too weak in every aspect of the taste, which was quite surprising, as I am a huge fan of the same flavor in Dymatize's Elite Casein.  \n",
      "If you're more of a quality-over-taste person, you can't go wrong with Iso-100. They blend to perfection in any variation of shaker cup I have tried, and they have the smoothness you can expect out of a true WPI. The pricing is fair, matching up fairly well with other isolate powerhouse brands.\n",
      "Dymatize iso-100 is DEFINITELY my go to protein! It's low in carbs, calories, sugar and it's lactose free. I used to consume regular whey but isolates are WHEY ( pun intended) better on my stomach. The flavors are pretty good. I plan to eventually try them all. Birthday cake is pretty popular but I personally didn't care for it. It's too sweet for my preferences. It taste more like icing than it does birthday cake imo. I don't normally like chocolate flavored protein but the one by dymatize is amazing. Taste similiar to hot chocolate. Fudge Brownie is good as well especially mixed with some pb2. The vanilla however is kind of plain, bland, and boring. There really isn't anything gourmet about it. I use it as a base when I want to blend my protein with some fruit. Overall, this protein mixes well and taste great. I've been gaining muscle and continuing to drop weight on thi. s product. Now if only it'll ever go on sale. Even though, it's worth the extra money\n",

      "I have to say that this product is absolutely delicious!  I mixed a scoop with almond milk and I feel like I'm cheating on my diet.  I hope to use this product to help lose weight and build lean muscle.  Let's get it!\n",
      "The Best Protien.\n",
      "This is my first time ever buying and using protein. I am so lucky to have found my staple protein here. Orange Dreamsicle is so DELICIOUS. Is it bad that I crave that protein? lol. The more you drink it, the more you taste the flavor which is amazing. I don't like milk so I was skeptical of taking it with water. I don't know how it is with milk but it's FANTASTIC with water. I'm so excited just thinking about it. Try it! It's really good!\n",
      "The Chocolate was delicious. I came from taking a weight gainer. While the gainer had everything i needed, I finally got to my target weight so I came upon this great no frills protein. Minimal additives and good quality. Just bought second 5lb container, but this time I'm trying out the Fudge Brownie. \n",
      "This is the best fast absorption protein powder I have ever tried. Easy to digest, easy to mix, easy to drink, because it tastes GREAT. I've noticed that when using a shaker, it works best to \"shake break shake\" meaning shake for about 30 seconds, stop for a munite and then shake once more. I believe the break in the middle really allows the protein clumps to soften and break down upon the second round of shaking. Ive used this technique on all brands of protein powder. The vanilla fravor tastes great by itself, but with milk it truely tastes like a milk shake. I prefer the orange dreamsicle with water, so I can taste the Orange flavor more distinctly. This is a great out of bed in the morning and post workout powder. \n",
      "First off I want to start by qualifying my comments. I am a fitness competitor and use supplements regularly in order to reap the benefits of iron warfare.  Over the past 5+ yrs I have exclusively relied on Optimum Nutrition and their Gold Standard whey.  Although that product is very good I feel strongly that it pales in comparison to Dymatize's Iso-100. The Iso-100 has fewer ingredients and does not contain any modified food starch which ON's extreme  milk chocolate currently does.  The price point for the Iso-100 might be a bit more, but WELL worth the gains. Why go to the gym and bust your a$$ only to utilize a muscle recovery aimed at saving you money? Look at the ingredients folks! Whey concentrate is cheap protein. Dymatize's Iso-100 contains ONLY whey protein isolate. Read up and educate yourself on the supplement world, FDA un-regulation and amino spiking. At the end of your workout you'll be glad you listened to me and shelled out an extra $0.30/serving. You're worth it!!!  \n",
      "By far the best iso protein I've ever tried. I mix it with egg whites to get a bit more extended release protein. No bloating or gassy feeling as I find with most other protein powders. It's worth the price. \n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommend this product! In my opinion the taste is impeccable compared to other proteins. If you have a sweet tooth birthday cake is great! For chocolate lovers try the gourmet chocolate as it will not disappoint! This product is excellent to take both pre/post workout and it mixes very smooth. Overall amazing and by far my favourite protein powder!\n",
      "Orange Dreamsicle taste amazing and mixes easily in my shaker cup. Dymatize ISO-100 is by far the best protein powder I've ever used.\n",
      "Very good protein. Tastes amazing. Great for building lean muscle. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Orange Dreamsicle flavor is amazing as well. Just like the real thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dissolves really well. Great flavors. Vanilla can leave a sort of strange after taste, but nothing offensive. This is my go to whey! Always happy with it.\n",
      "Very good product, mixes very well with water, very little foaming after mixing. The cookies and cream flavor is delicious, fells even better mixing the powder with cold water or adding some ice cubes.\n",
      "the flavor of the gourmet chocolate is spot on\n",
      "the cookies n cream is a tad sweet (my $.02)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "High quality whey protein. Worked just as well if not better than most whey proteins I've taken. Great post-workout. Really easy to mix. Not sure if it's worth the price though. Gourmet chocolate is the only flavor I've tried and was unimpressed. Planning on trying fudge brownie to see if it's any better.\n",
      "Pleasantly surprised at the flavor and how well it mixed. Took it right after my more intense workouts, can't say exactly how much it contributed to my progress but I feel it was enough to purchase again\n",
      "By far the best tasting protein powder I have ever tried, and I've tried a lot. In the past I would down my protein shake as fast as possible to avoid having to taste linger. However, these flavours are an escape from the bland chocolate/vanilla prison that most bodybuilders have been trapped in and I'll actually find myself sipping on my shake and really enjoying it instead of choking it down. The Cinnamon Bun is on point and I hope they keep it around. \n",
      "Some of the flavors are great.  The birthday cake is worth celebrating along with fudge brownie.  Don't use more than 6 ounces per scoop of water if that's how you do it.   Having just tried Fudge Brownie I just cannot believe how good the flavor is.  It literally smells and tastes like a fudge brownie.  No aftertaste either. The gourmet vanilla is awful, sorry dymatize.   The gourmet chocolate is OK but it doesn't beat the fudge brown IMO.  Banana and CAC are OK, not my favorite though.   This is my go to protein and I do not see myself getting anything else at this time.  No side effects.\n",
      "Enjoy the taste of this product. Feel great results when using theis product prior to and after my workouts.\n",
      "I have been a huge fan of Iso 100 - price, stats and flavor are great.  lately however I have been doing more baking and notice that it doesn't do as well compared to other brands I have tried.  mix-ablitly is not the best. \n",
      "Orange dreamsicle taste almost like the ice cream bars I ate as a kid! I really love this whey protein. mixed easy, no after taste, great all around!\n",
      "TASTES AMAZING!\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent product, higher quality then almost any powder on the market. 29g per scoop and 25 of this is protein. That ratio really is top of the line. I switched to Dymatize from BSN for one main reason, when tested syntha-6 came out to be 53% protein per scoop where as ISO-100 comes out to 88% protein. There is no comparison. Birthday cake tastes literally like cake, it is great. I have tried cake batter flavored protein from other brands but this is the most spot on flavor or any of them. Really impressed. Disappointed I wasted so much money on other protein companies but glad I finally found Dymatize. Everyone out there should read up on amino spiking. It is a really big problem in the industry. When tested Dymatize had the second purest protein of any company in iso-100 only behind NOW foods isolate. I choose Dymatize over NOW because the birthday cake flavor. After going through 5 pounds of birthday cake having it everyday, I did get kind of bored with it so my second tub was fudge brownie. Tastes chocolatey but not necessary lie a brownie. \n",
      "This product works extremely well and mixes in with water to the point where it is almost a creamy milk substance. It is not as mixable to the point where it is clear. I recommend Iso-100 as a good whey protein HOWEVER the flavor is absolutely terrible. It is way too sweet, and that's coming from somebody who actively participates and wins 1 gallon Ice cream challenges. I love cinnamon rolls but drinking the shake is kind of like somebody pouring the icing you put on the Pillsbury Dough Boy cinnamnon rolls down your throat. The flavor matches cinnamnon buns, however it is not a good flavor.\n",
      "Is easy on the stomach which is why I got it. My wife is essentially lactose intolerant so this worked well for her. No lactose problems :)\n",
      "My go to protein. Mixes well and has awesome macros. Really well priced and works great in baking. I add it to oatmeal, and replace flours in pancakes and waffles.\n",
      "Mixes very well. Super smooth and thin. Love the macros. Only wish it was naturally sweetened!\n",
      "Birthday Cake was too sweet for my liking. Not a fan at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "By far one of my favorite products. I like ISO-100 Whey protein isolate because it tastes absolutely amazing, mixes smooth (not chalky), lactose free, and is fast absorbing. \n",
      "I have first used vanilla and it tasted so good and smelled even better, my second taste was gourmet chocolate and i got to say it tastes very weird the powder itself is not same looking, its so soft and smells horrible when shaken with water , I am not sure if this is normal or not, can anyone helps?\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent tasting and breaks down easily but leaves a little bit of an aftertaste. I will buy this product again but try a different flavor\n",
      "Mixes and blends well, with a great nutritional profile to boot.  Tastes great as well, highly recommend this whey isolate\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein powder is awesome! Been using it for over the past year.. Tastes great, and is super fast digesting so it's perfect for after a workout. I've tried birthday cake, orange dreamsicle, fudge brownie, gourmet chocolate, cookies and cream, and smooth banana. They're all fantastic except banana tastes quite artificial. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Great protein shake .Also has lower cholesterol than any other brand I have seen on the market. Great product recommend it for everybody. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are looking for a TOP QUALITY, TASTY, and easily mixable Isolate then look no further. Dymatize has got everything right with this product. Highly Recommended.\n",
      "Having used Gourmet Chocolate for years, I was starting to feel the need to try other flavours. Chocolate was on backorder so this was the chance to try something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, the smell. DO NOT smell it before you drink it or it will completely turn your stomach. The smell is best compared to an unwashed shaker of vanilla flavoured protein. \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste, is nowhere near as nice as Gourmet Chocolate. It is very very sweet. The main taste I get from it is watered down white chocolate. \n",
      "\n",
      "I won't be buying this flavour again. \n",
      "taste great, sweet but not too sweet\n",
      "My favorite protein powders and I have tried most of them. Very clean and easy on my stomach. Mixes well and tastes really good.\n",
      "Mixes great and taste great as well. Crave it sometimes which is a change of pace in protein for me as I have dreaded taking some other proteins that clump and taste gross. \n",
      "Tried this protein powder and to my surprise it's delicious. :)  Great for stage prep when i cant have actual birthday cake ;)\n",
      "This was the first protein powder I've ever tried, and I'm very satisfied with it. I love that it's low carb (although I mix it with milk), and the cookies and cream flavour tastes actually pretty good! It doesn't have that fake sweet taste and the texture of it (I mix one scoop with 6 oz of milk) is smooth, rather than clumpy like creatine products. \n",
      "I'm so obsessed with Cookies and Cream. I look forward to it everyday as if it's my dessert. The foam is a little annoying but who cares. I also wish it wasn't so expensive.. \n",
      "I love Dymatize Gourmet Chocolate, so I thought fudge brownie would be even better! It smells wonderful, tastes horrible. Will have to play around with different mixers because unfortunately I bought 5 lbs of it, so I'll be dealing with it for a while. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great product. Very pure for fast dygestion and mixes and taste great. Fair price for the quality just wish they'd have a 10 lbs tub available. This will be my go to protien for a while.\n",
      "I drink 150 grams of protein alone every day and this is the best protein for me because the calories are as low as it can get for protein. taste was ok I am on my 4th 20 pound order of the stuff. cookies and cream is the best of the ones I had\n",
      "ISO-100 overall mixes into a thin consistency.  No making sludge with this.  \n",
      "Orange Dreamsicle is entirely too sweet for my taste.  I've tried adding double liquid, mixing with milk, etc., and while it reminds me of the frozen orange push-ups from my youth, this is just too artificially sweet tasting to me. \n",
      "Gourmet Chocolate is nice. I tend to mix it with my morning coffee and it tastes nearly like hot chocolate...no mocha taste from the coffee at all. Warning - you have to temper the whey before adding hot coffee to it.  I tried adding coffee from the pot to the whey & it seized into a nasty mess...it was like the whey coagulated & the flavoring separated. Lesson learned.  \n",
      "I'd buy the Gourmet Chocolate again, but not the Orange Dreamsicle. \n",
      "Absolutely love the Dymatize Gourmet Chocolate. Matter a fact bought it for years and has been a wonderful protein source. Decided to venture out and try something new and went with the fudge brownie. Huge mistake! No matter what you do the product will not mix. Even using a blender on high speed it remains clumping and difficult to swallow. Impressed with the gourmet chocolate- can't believe how different choosing a different flavor can be. Go with gourmet chocolate and stay away from fudge brownie.\n",
      "One of their best tasting flavors! It's so smooth and doesn't make me feel bloated after drinking. Mixes well also for homemade protein bars and protein pancakes, and protein French toast. I always suggest Dymatize Iso-100.\n",
      "This protein powder is great! I have tried the cake and banana flavors and both are really good. The cake was a little to sweet for my taste but overall it was still good. The banana flavor is amazing even when mixed with water. I am looking forward to trying the other flavors and definitely recommend this product!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gourmet Chocolate is pretty good tasting. Best described as a melted fudgesicle. The only issue I have noted compared to the other flavors the chocolate does not stay suspended in water when mixed ahead of time. So don't forget to shake it up when you pull it out of the fridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Orange Dreamsicle tastes like melted orange sherbet. it's great stuff and I really like it. I just don't think you can go wrong with any of the Dymatize ISO-100's. They really have the taste thing mastered in this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cinnamon Bun whey protein is awesome. Even if it wasn't beneficial as protein this stuff would be good just for a dessert drink. This is the best Whey protein I have ever tried. I wish BB.com would hurry up and put this out in 5 pounders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Strawberry sucks. It's like drinking water and later thinking that sort of had a strawberry taste. Skip this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price is a little high, but it is not as extreme as some other brands.\n",
      "This is the best flavor they have to me. It's very thin and the taste is a little dull, but it's overall a good product. I wish it was thicker.\n",
      "Great product mixes extremely easy. Tastes fantastic. Only thing is it kind of messes with my stomach as far as gas and that type of stuff.. But I love it and feel like I get the results I was looking for when I bought it so hands down 9 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Way, way, wayyyyyy too sweet. Only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because, yes it tastes like (albeit chemical) buttery, icing laden, vanilla-y, birthday cake... But NOT in a good way. And I love sweets, but this is some next level artificial sweet couldn't drink even half sweetness. I GUESS I will choke down the rest of this since I bought it... Might try cutting the sweetness with raw cocoa powder or something. The chemical butter taste is what really grosses me out. \n",
      "I wonder if every flavor of Dymatize is this sweet?\n",
      "Truly love the idea and value of this product though!\n",
      "Nice quality product. Mixes well. I was paying more for a comparable brand but have not looked back since I started using Dymatize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Birthday cake tasted just like icing and cake. It was a bit too sweet for my taste but the flavor is spot on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strawberry was decent... it seemed to be a bit light on Strawberry flavor  but not bad. Its great mixed 50/50 with smooth banana!\n",
      "\n",
      "Smooth Banana seemed to be lacking flavor and is lightly sweet. Same as the strawberry, I was hoping for a more \"artificial\" candy flavor... yes I am strange. The powder has a strong sweet smell just like candy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Orange Dreamsicle is as the name implies! My fav.\n",
      "The taste is terrible - too sweet,exaggerated - the worst chocolate protein I've ever had. And it mixes poorly in comparison to other proteins. Read so many great reviews and wanted to give it a try but was disappointed.:(\n",
      "Great tasting... goes down fast... easy to mix... great macros!\n",
      "by far the best whey protein iv ever had, its hydrolyzed, isolated, 100% percent pure whey protein, gluten free and lactose free, i mean it can’t get better than that !! i just bought a new flavor ( gourmet chocolate ) can’t wait to try it !! \n",
      "Never tried this protein powder before. Recommended by a friend to start taking this and I must say the Fudge Brownie is awesome. The flavor is amazing. Great taste, great quality and I highly recommend this flavor to everyone!!!\n",
      "I was so disappointed with this. I bought this brand specifically for the very low carb content and the new Cinnamon Bun flavor. I've had Cinnamon Bun flavor before from two other brands (MP and BSN) and liked it a lot. It's fabulous mixed in a lot of things and by itself.  It's by far my favorite flavor, but those two brands both have higher carb contents than the Dymatize ISO 100.  While the flavor is good, actually a bit too sweet, which I can't even believe I am saying, the texture is horrible. It doesn't mix well and has a grainy texture I can't get past. I won't buy this brand again.\n",
      "Dymatize ISO-100 is a excellent product. Mixes well, great taste, and most importantly I'm getting results.  \n",
      "Cinnamon Bun is my favorite out of all of the flavors, even though they all taste amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "good flavor. not heavy at all with water and it doesnt sit in your stomach. ive gotten good results and it seems like doms is reduced when i use this product. will continue to use this protein\n",
      "Since i started taking whey protein I've always loved ISO 100 chocolate, fudge brownie & birthday cake are my favorites no nasty after tastes\n",
      "I just tried the new cinnamon bun exclusive and it is fantastic. I usually buy Trutein, but I wanted a faster absorbing protein with less calories and carbs. The only thing that would make this product better, is if it came in the 5 lb. canister! I will  be purchasing this product again, sooner than I wanted to, because I drink at least 2 shakes a day. \n",
      "\n",
      "One scoop in 8oz of water. And it's like drinking ice cream. It's never upset my stomach, this is my new favorite. \n",
      "Worst protein ever. Too sweet and very hard to mix. To avoid.\n",
      "I really don't know how you could go wrong with this protein. It has such an amazing taste and it mixes so well. I never really looked forward to drinking my protein shakes, but after tasting this one I really can't wait for my workout to be over. Sometimes I'll drink 2-3 servings a day because it's just that good. I'll be trying the birthday cake taste after I'm done with this tub. Overall, I'm really satisfied with this product.\n",
      "The Cinnamon Bun is SOOO DELICIOUS!! I'm surprised at how low it's rated but I'm glad I took a gamble (I'm usually not a big fan of any chocolate flavored products but next time I might try the gourmet chocolate...). \n",
      "I can't fully comment on the effectiveness of this since I just received this but my trainer recommended it and she knows what she's talking about.\n",
      "Best protein I've bought to date. Flavor 100% amazing. If you like chocolate then you'll love this stuff, not to mention it doesn't clump and mixes perfectly! Get this protein!!! Worth every penny!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great tasting protein, love me the cinnamon bun flavor but you can't go wrong with any of the flavors. ISO-100 never disappoints. \n",
      "I loveee Dymatize ISO-100! Seriously never lets me down and the flavor is great!! Chocolate is an all around favorite but I prefer Fudge Brownie(very chocolatey) since I'm a chocolate lover. Birthday Cake(very sweet) tastes exactly as it states, even more amazing when mixed into greekyogurt or pancakes! Cinnamon Bun is good, not crazy about it but its definitely worth trying..love mixing into my oatmeal! all taste good enough to drink with water\n",
      "\n",
      "It has a great profile but I got bored and fed up with the taste pretty quickly. I used for over a year and I wouldn't say I noticed any gains. It maintained my muscle mass but again, it is just protein. Nothing much to expect!\n",
      "Love the flavor. Don't have to add anything to this when making a shake on the go. It takes close to an orange dreamsicle. I love ISO 100 due to the low to no carb numbers. It takes amazing. I love mixing this with Arctic Zero as well!\n",
      "This is one of the best protein powders I've ever had. The Gourmet Chocolate is very delicious, the Fudge Brownie is the same thing and has that brownie fudge taste to it, the Strawberry is also good, the Banana however, not really that good but it's tolerable. The mixability here is really easy, several stirs with a spoon and you're good. Only complaint is it seems less than the servings each tub has on the label, I seem to run out pretty quick, but likely it's why it's slightly cheaper than the other powders, or maybe that's why I like it so much, I take it a lot and I'm already done with the tub. Would buy again. I think this is one of the most underrated proteins out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I usually get vanilla or birthday cake flavor- both are awesome! Decided to try cookies and cream cause it had a high taste rating but it fell flat in my opinion. Wish I'd stuck with my usual!\n",
      "Great tasting, great product.\n",
      "Great whey isolate product.  Only protein I buy aside from Stoppani's ProJym blend.  Birthday Cake tastes amazing!\n",
      "This is the best taste Whey ISO I've tasted.  This is very addictive. It dissolves quickly with no grit or clumps\n",
      "Great protein product you have right here, plenty of nutrients, plus its partly sweetened with stevia extract which in my opinion is great. Mixability is pretty good but if I let it sit for let's say 30 minutes without touching it, there's some dye or cacao setting at the bottom of my shaker. No big deal, just shake it twice and its gone. Taste is ok but not the best I've had, should've went with gourmet chocolate instead. Had great recovery times with this Iso and packed on 6 pounds of muscle in 4 weeks with this thing. Overall I'd recommend it to any of my friends but in a different flavor\n",
      "I've been taking Iso 100 for a. The macros and quality of protein is one of the best available! Very lean! Flavors however very in terms of quality in my views. The Gourmet Chocolate which I currently use mixes so clean and tastes amazing and would be my all time favorite protein.\n",
      "This protein tastes like cake batter. No joke. Like you poured the mix straight from the box, added some water and ate it. Its tastes better than any other protein I have ever had and it mixes well. It is hands down the most delicious protein I have ever eaten and I will be buying this product from now on. OMFG its so good. I couldn't stop saying \"WOW! omg...this is so good\" when i tried it. I can't wait to buy fudge brownie!\n",
      "I used this protein powder I think before Christmas of 2014...its awesome...clearly the best you can get...alittle pricey but well worth the investment\n",
      "Out of the 3 flavors I tasted, I think the Fudge Brownie is best. The Gourmet Chocolate is not what I expected. I will definitely order more of the FB in the future. \n",
      "My favorite protein powder. If you have tried other protein powders then you might notice the taste does not come close to the flavor labeled on the bottle. But not this one, its fuarking delicious!\n",
      "We absolutely LOVE this stuff!  It mixes very well in a blender bottle.  We mix this flavor in Dole Paradise Blend brand; ( Filtered water, pineapple juice concentrate, grape juice concentrate, apple juice concentrate, carrot juice concentrate, passion fruit juice concentrate, natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and beta carotene)  Great taste.  Have been very happy with the physical results that we are achieving.  If you're an orange flavor fan, give this stuff a try.  \n",
      "Great flavor!\n",
      "best mixing whey i have ever used, the fudge brownie was just too chocolatey for me to handle but if you are a chocolate fiend, go for it\n",
      "The protein powder itself mixes well and is lactose-free----however, the banana flavor is disgusting. A friend recommended I mix it with orange juice to make an \"Orange Julius\"...holy cow. I tried mixing it with almond milk, water, OJ...nothing made the artificial Laffy Taffy taste go away. I won't be finishing it. \n",
      "Low Carb, Best Chocolate flavor is fudge brownie. to me, if you mix it with less water, it has the taste AND consistency of actual brownie batter! so it def feels like a cheat meal! a little more pricey tho the regular elite 100% whey. probably wont order it again except for if i really crave the flavor since the \"whey concentrate\" \"whey isolate\" \"hey hydrosolate\" thing doesnt really make a difference to me and my goals. but if it matters to you, go with this, and this flavor!\n",
      "Great product, birthday cake is the worst tasting flavour of protein I have ever had though...DONT ORDER IT ITS TERRIBLE. Pick a different flavour\n",
      "Taste is great!!, mixability is excellent, Gourmet Chocolate is out of this world!!!\n",
      "I have tried quite a few proteins. Always find myself going back to this one. The GNC people say its better to get a blend and dont recommend it, but i find this is the most easily digested while other cause bloating. Strawberry is delicious I finished my first bottle in a week. Pina Colada was horrible, tasted like chalk, one of the worst tasting proteins i have tried recently. Brownie was okay but not great. \n",
      "They should replace the pina colada with a coffee flavour like cappucino, or caramel latte.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite protein powder after trying many ! Poor in fat and carbs which is perfect if you are trying to build lean muscle. Love the fudge brownie flavour but have also tried pina colada, vanilla, banana...and they all taste amazing ! Very recommended !\n",
      "I've been a Dymatize protein user for a very long time now simply due to it's quality, effectiveness, great taste and at a price that doesn't break the bank. I recently switched to ISO-100 and am very pleased with it. Very fast absorption that provides a high 25g's of protein with 5.5g's of BCAA's in each scoop. Mixes exceptionally well with no clumping. Less than a gram of sugar and fat, this profile fits perfectly into my diet\n",
      "I've been purchasing this protein since January 2014! This fast absorbing hydrolyzed whey protein is 100% pure, non-denatured, non-acid treated hydrolyzed whey with absolutely no whey concentrate, ion exchange, or other cheaper forms of protein. The taste is superb, and you can blend it with anything. \n",
      "taste is awesome, mixability is awesome, recovery and grow too !!!\n",
      "Shipping was fast, the orange dreamsicle has an amazing taste, I only use water for every protein drink, not too sour or sweet, taste is well balanced, however this depends on how much water your using, you can alter the taste by adjusting how much water you use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negatives: The protein jar container had a very thin slice cut at the top of the protein jar in the (black plastic area) which must've happened when the online store employees had been using a box cutter when un-boxing protein powder jars from Dymatize's shipment, this cut on the container made bits of the powder to leak inside the box. The only good news was under the jar's lid the sticker or seal was fully on, and the taste wasn't affected  so that was the only good news. \n",
      "A great Isolate, I've used it in the past and decided to revisit it.  I got the Vanilla and the Birthday Cake.  Vanilla tastes the way it should, but the Birthday Cake tastes like a chemically-buttery-super sweet version of Vanilla.  I often have to add more water because it is unusually sweet.  I will finish it because I don't waste money like that, but no more Iso-100 Birthday Cake for me!\n",
      "I have tried other whey protein, but none of them have been as good as Iso-100. It tastes great when mixed with water which really helps keeps the calories in check.  I love the chocolate flavors.  The cinnamon bun is my next favorite and then cookies and cream.  Cookies and cream is really good blended with berries.  My least favorite is the vanilla.  The flavor overpowers everything that I have tried to blend with it.  The vanilla flavor is okay on its own, but I wouldn't choose it.\n",
      "This is one of the best isolate proteins that I have used. It mixes great and tastes even better!!!!! Love the profile with low calorie (110 serving), 0 fat, 0 sugar, and still 25 grams of protein. Great protein supplement for cutting\n",
      "I began using the Dymatize ISO-100 Whey Protein to help support my goals to build muscle. Immediately following my workouts, I quickly add 1 to 2 scoops to my shaker, some water and BAM....protein straight to the muscles!!!! It tastes great and dissolves easily. Its a great protein to consume following an intense workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best tasting protein I have taken. It has a lot of great stuff already in it like Bcaas. I would highly recommend this.\n",
      "First time using ISO-100 in years and decided to give it a shot again. \n",
      "\n",
      "I used to work in a supplement shop where we were very particular with what brands we carried. Mainly to avoid pixie-dusting and amino spiking proteins or pixie-dusted pre-workouts. After looking at the nutrition facts (scoop gram size, contents, etc) it was clear that Dymatize makes a great affordable and well manufactured protein powder. It tastes great, mixes well, sits in your stomach well, and is a great value. I will probably be using ISO-100 for a long time now. And it helps that bodybuilding.com has quick shipping and awesome prices!\n",
      "Best whey I ever had. Always mixed really well and great taste of chocolate. Best whey if you want to manage your macros you can add whatever you want and get the right amount. I tried 53g of this whey (gourmet raspberry, which is no more available) with 43g of powder gatorade for my post-workout and got really good results. With gourmet chocolate I didn't needed to mix it it tasted very good and there's real cacao in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The birthday cake is also very good. It has a really sweet taste with a very light touch of vanilla. It mixes very well just like the whole ISO-100 serie.\n",
      "Excellent , Excellent, Excellent.... Tastes great, mixes well, didn't feel bloated after 2 scoops and fast absorbing. When you order this I suggest also ordering the banana protein as it's good to have in the pantry for Protein pancakes, cookies, creamer for coffee, etc...\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect protein. It's not only isolate, but also zero fat.\n",
      "Good taste !! \n",
      "I am a chocolate eater, so I do prefer the fudge brownie. My husband loves the cookies and crème. I like to mix my fudge brownie into my cup of coffee in the morning and this has become one of my favorite shakes.\n",
      "great protein isolate. glad that I was able to find a protein that did not bother my stomach because I am lactose intolerant. This flavor was a bit sweet for me, other than that great stuff. great isolate to slam down right after your workout and right before cardio.\n",
      "Probably the best tasting product on the market. You can always mix another flavor into your gourmet vanilla. I don't like the 1.6 lb nonsense, and they did get tricky with their new scoops. Every now and again you can find 1.9 lb tubs for sale for the price of the 1.6 lb. They took off the measurement marks on their new scoop. I guess this is to let users who do not pay attention use more. Replacing the sweetener with stevia is a plus.\n",
      "Good protein for morning shake. Flavor mixes great with anything...in my case oatmeal. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am SUPER picky when it comes to whey protein and actually avoided using it for a long time because I typically can't stand the taste and mixability, but ISO-100 nails it for me! It's actually a toss up between Fudge Brownie and Birthday Cake for most delicious flavors! Not only do they taste good but the macros are super on point. Low cal/low carb/low fat/low sugar! \n",
      "\n",
      "Birthday cake is good the first couple times but gets boring really quick, sucks I ordered 2 tubs of it lol\n",
      "This is my favorite post workout protein powder!\n",
      "Cinnamon Bun is hands down the best protein I have ever tasted, period. It is a bit sweet, even mixed with just water, but it's something that I honestly look forward every day after a workout and it helps to satisfy my sweet tooth. I let my sister taste it and she tried to steal the rest of the tub.\n",
      "I decided to try this product because I heard great things about the flavor.  I regularly use NLA for Her - Her Whey which is awesome!  But, they only have 2 flavors and I only like one of them, and I was getting bored with the same flavor every day.  The flavor of ISO-100 cannot be beat.  The fudge brownie smells like Duncan Hines brownie mix when you open it.  This doesn't give me the options to rate the Birthday Cake flavor, but it is amazing.  Like drinking liquid buttercream!  This product has great blendability and digests very easy!  Love it!  I will still use NLA for Her from time to time, but hope they come up with a new flavor!\n",
      "Best protein on the market today,in taste and quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the Cake Batter flavor as the first protein I ever purchased, and it was absolutely delicious. The second flavor I got was the Orange Dreamsicle since I had such a good experience with the Cake Batter. It's hard to determine which flavor I enjoyed more! I usually just do one scoop post-workout, and I definitely noticed not getting as sore after workouts. This protein made me believe that protein could really taste delicious! \n",
      "I have used many protein powders in my life, but the Birthday cake is without any debut is the most delicious. I have never tasted such a good product. It has an ice cream taste, absolutely amazing !\n",
      "\n",
      "Easily mixes with plain water and the taste is amazing. Be cautious though when mixing it with other ingredients besides just water, it's more on the sweeter side. I will be trying other flavour a in the future. \n",
      "I got to say Dymatize is one of the best for the flavor. Wow! That orange creamsicle is delicious.\n",
      "This is by far the best tasting chocolate protein I've ever had. Taste like a chocolate milkshake and it has less than 1 gram of sugar in it. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Strawberry tastes horrible.. rest is very good! Good Profile!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First protein powder used; combo with Assault as pre-work out. I use this after my work outs and before bed for muscle recovery. LOVE the taste; even good if you add cinnamon to switch it up some. \n",
      "My protein of choice - it never disappoints.\n",
      "ISO 100 is a prep must the ease of digestion and whey isolate formula are a must have. The cookies and cream flavor I am using now is not quite as good as other flavors but the Birthday Cake is my all time favorite! \n",
      "This product is far too sweet, not sure how other people can drink it unless they are adding stuff to it. I took 2 sips and had to stop\n",
      "Great Iso protein shake that has a superb flavor, mixes well, and seems to get to my muscles rejuvenating them.  I love to mix in a scoop of peanut butter this this flavor, it enhances it's taste putting somewhere between a butterfinger and a Recces Peanut Butter Cup depending on how much peanut butter I add.\n",
      "I bought this a few months back in the birthday cake flavor. Wow.. amazing..altho it truly has more of a cake frosting flavor with a buttery scent..I still I enjoyed it.I've used it to make wonderful protein pancakes..Just awesome... Now I'm debating what flavor to try next! Because I can't do just one flavor year round of course. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great texture and flavor.  Great to cook with when I am making protein pancakes, fat free protein banana bread and protein bars. \n",
      "\n",
      "Protein shakes are easy for on-the-go nutrition. Shakes are great for a healthy, inexpensive and convenient meals.  I really like this protein so I buy it in bulk and it only costs like .90 or less a shake.   You can put a scoop in a baggie and carry it with you in your purse, book bag, or car. It's easy to pack it along on trips or have a few servings at work.  I look for powders that are high in protein, great taste and texture, is gluten- and lactose-free, and has little to no preservatives.  This is a great choice that I always recommend to people when they ask me what they should buy.\n",
      "No other protein on the planet mixes as well as this. Tastes great for an isolate, and is reasonably priced for an isolate. Never once had digestion issues(I'm lactose intolerant) or anything, ever, using this. Easily the best isolate I've ever tried.\n",
      "This protein is delicious, mixes well, and has a great nutritional profile. The Orange dreamsicle is the best whey I've had. The birthday cake is pretty good too. Great for the sweet tooth. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid Birthday Cake. Had to send it back due to the fact that its very sweet and smells like melted butter when you try to drink it. Other than that, Dymatize makes excellent products! I am pretty lactose intolerant and this does the job better than other products! Definitely try the cookies and cream, chocolate and vanilla flavours! I will be waiting to buy the Fudge brownie after I am done with vanilla\n",
      "Best protein on the market.  If you're not using this or another isolate you're better off saving your money and just buying (body fortress) walmart protein. \n",
      "I love this stuff. Used it during my contest prep and it definitely helped me with my late night cravings. Fudge Brownie is my favorite and I still use it during my off season. Mixes smoothly, no clumps. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The protein i feel is quality. No bloat no stomach issues etc. I was using the cookies and cream before the fudge brownie and enjoyed it. I switched to trying the fudge brownie, i finf it a little too sweet for my tastebuds and prefer the cookies and cream. Just add a little extra water to lighten the sweetness.\n",
      "While I appreciate the low number of ingredients and hydrolyzed whey isolate, the powder is just WAY too sweet. They instructions suggest 5-6oz of water, milk, or juice but a full scoop in 16oz of water is sickeningly sweet and normally leaves my stomach a little wobbly until i eat or drink something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fudge brownie flavor isn't very chocolatey; any chocolate flavor is overwritten by the pure sweetness of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They really could do without the Sucralose and just use Stevia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time I try an artificially-sweetened protein powder, it makes me want to switch to unflavored whey.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are way better tasting proteins out there. Not recommended.\n",
      "I highly recommend this product. Excellent ingredients, mixes very well and, at least for me, is very easily digested. I love the orange dreamsicle flavor!\n",
      "Overall this is the best ISO-protein I have ever tried Specially Cinamon Bun! It is delicious! cookies and cream and fudge brownie are also great tasting. all the other flavors taste pretty good too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everytime I am prepping for a show, I have had to stop using whatever whey protein shakes I was using, because as I was trying to lean out they would make me bloated. I have tried so many brands of whey protein, and I have finally found a shake I can take as I am in my final weeks dieting for my show. Dymatize ISO 100 is amazing. Not only does it not cause any bloat, and gives me the extra protein I need these days, but it mixes great and tastes amazing. I have finally found the perfect whey protein shake\n",
      "I got this Dymatize Iso-100 and love the taste and the quality of this protein. I would recommend it to everyone. The birthday cake is really sweet so I added extra water to it.\n",
      "i have been using it and I love its taste and feel that it gives me enough protien what is required for my body ..\n",
      "This mixes well and is delicious. I'm pretty particular about flavor and this is the best protein I've tried. It mixes well. My only complaint is that it gets a little foamy and you need to let it settle before you drink it, unless you just want to man up and  suck it down, foam and all. I'll be drinking this stuff for a while I think. \n",
      "THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!!  Who would think that 11oz of water and two scoops of this stuff could fill you up!   I've had two flavors, Pina Colada and Smooth Banana.  They are Both GREAT!!!    110cals, 25grms Protein, 0carbs, 0fat.  OMG Almost as good as Egg Whites.. Wait.. BettAH then Egg Whites!! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This Whey Protein definitely surpassed all of my expectations. Not to mention how great the Gourmet tastes. It's like I'm drinking hot chocolate, and that's when mixing with water! The results I have been getting are pretty great too. I went on a 5 month hiatus, and I started back up with this as my go to supplement and I have never experienced so much gain. Keep it up Dymatize\n",
      "I've noticed better gains with this protein than the regular whey proteins I've tried. It's worth the extra price per serving. Mixability is great. Fudge Brownie tastes awesome. \n",
      "Love this flavor and how smooth it taste. Mix ability is awesome as well and for the quality you get you can't beat the price\n",
      "Love this product, mixes and taste perfect. \n",
      "Recommend !!! \n",
      "New favorite, mixes perfect every time, tastes so good, doesn't hurt my sensitive stomach, acts fast! New favorite! \n",
      "\n",
      "I love eating Hershey's chocolate but I was disappointed with the Gourmet Chocolate flavor. It has a weird smell and an immediate after taste. The Cinnamon Bun and Gourmet Vanilla flavors were great, they were true to their flavor. Keep in mind, I only mixed these protein supplements with water, rather than mixing it with additional ingredients to enhance or mask their flavors. \n",
      "I completely enjoy the product.  It s definitely making me healthier.\n",
      "I always use Dymatize and reached outstanding results with this product, and this is the 6th ISO-100 flavor I have tried. I LOVED Birthday Cake, Cookies&Cream, Orange Dreamsicle, Vanilla, and Chocolate. I wanted to enjoy Cinnamon Bun, but I was disappointed with the flavor. I will definitely be reordering Birthday Cake as soon as I get through this Cinnamon Bun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is by far one of the best proteins I've ever tasted and have used. It mixes way better than the normal Dymatize whey protein which will leave some chunks and can be kind of sandy I guess for lack of a better term and is also better than ONs Extreme Milk Chocolate in terms of mix ability and taste although ONs mix ability is actually pretty good.\n",
      "READ THIS!! The most important aspect about this protein is it's incredibly strong smell. I mix smooth banana and gourmet chocolate in plastic baggies that I then put into my gym bag along with my workout clothes. This stuff smells so strongly of candy/sweetness, that almost anyone that walks by me at the gym asks \"what's that cotton candy smell?\". I've never used a protein that smelled so strongly and that soaked everything in my workout bag with it's smell.  The cotton candy/sweetness smell is overwhelming, even when sealed in plastic baggies. Besides the ridiculous smell, the protein mixes relatively well in a shaker bottle. It foams up heavily at first, but after about 1 or 2 minutes it settles and is drinkable.\n",
      "Found Fudge brownie to be decent.. still haven't seen anything better than Gourmet Chocolate!\n",
      "Honestly one of the best proteins I've recently tried. I've been switching up my proteins to try different companies and my coach recommended me Dymatize ISO 100. Feel in love! What I enjoy about ISO 100 is the flavor, liteness and quality. For taking in 3 protein shakes a day I don't ever feel bloated with ISO 100. They won supplement of the year for a reason!!\n",
      "Best ISO whey available for the money. Has what you would need and no junk you don't. Taste is great.\n",
      "It's so delicious and smooth! Tastes even better blended with a tablespoon of natural peanut butter or 2 tbsp of PB2. It's like drinking a dessert!\n",
      "dymatize is the best for me but this flavor was the worst i ever tasted\n",
      "I love the taste of this flavor (Orange Dreamsicle) after a hour in the gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an excellent whey protein and I highly recommend it. I know its somewhat pricey but it is indeed one of the best on the market. The flavors that I have tried are great. Also, it mixes well with either water or milk.\n",
      "Great protein shake while on contest diet. I have used dymatize ISO-100 for my last 2 bodybuilding competition. High in protein n low in fats carbs calories sugar. Perfect shake when you need that protein intake on the go while keeping the rest of your macros in check. Mixes great no clumps tried most of the flavors there all good but my  favorite one was birthday cake. \n",
      "this protein is really good, but for me cinnamon bun and coockies and cream are really sweet for me, every time I take it I feel like im drinking just sugar, orange dreamsicle is so far the best flavor I ever had and I really enjoy drinking this protein.\n",
      "Pretty sweet but perfect for me. Tastes great mixed with water as \"milk\" for post-workout cereal (Rice Krispies, Rice Chex, puffed rice, Cheerios, Kix). Nutrition profile is outstanding. Love this stuff. \n",
      "I love the other flavors, and just ordered Cinnamon Bun.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes very well, and more importantly:  absolutely delicious.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I mixed it with unsweetened almond milk, the first thing I thought of was that it tasted like drinking the milk from your bowl after eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a sweet tooth like me, you'll love it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes great but taste like *** with some stevia sprinkled on it.  Was extremely disappointed\n",
      "LOVE these protein powders!  They dissolve easily in water.  When I make the gourmet chocolate with ice water and natural peanut butter, I am in heaven!  It tastes better than a Wendy's chocolate frosty in my opinion.  Mmmmm mmmm mmmm.\n",
      "This protein is delicious, seriously. It DOES taste like birthday cake, and gives me the protein I need to boot. I am currently ingesting 240 grams of protein for my contest prep (I'm a 5'6\" girl at 12%BF and 147 lbs.), and so drinking my protein definitely helps. I've steadily lost bodyfat and gained lean mass, so I of course attribute some of that to my my high protein levels, of which I drink this shake twice a day. I think it's great. Milk chocolate is another fantastic flavor, but I don't see it on BB.com?\n",
      "Fudge Brownie is the best Protein I've ever bought.  Low cal, low carb, min ingredients don't get better than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "A super delicious and easily digestible protein source with minimal 'other' ingredients. It doesn't get better than Dymatize's hydrolyzed isolates. The gourmet chocolate taste a lot like chocolate milk!\n",
      "Light protein powder that mixes great, but \"Birthday Cake\" is NOT a flavor I will try again.  Way too sweet.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I was excited to try this flavor because the reviews were decent. However when I made my first shake I actually spit it out in the sink. The taste was super sweat and obnoxious tasting. I sent it back the next day. \n",
      "I purchased this product due to some of the reviews I had seen online. Bad idea. I will never purchase this flavor again due to the flavor and the synthetic sweet taste it delivers. Buyers beware it does not have any birthday cake flavor at all. \n",
      "I'm so surprised that I didn't enjoy this flavor! I enjoy everything sweet and desserts, so I thought I would love this one. It tasted like pure fake sugar and overly sweet (in a bad way). The content of the protein is good, but I wish I had bought a different flavor :( I'm so disappointed in Birthday Cake.\n",
      "Very good product. I used the gourmet chocolate one and it is the best tasting chocolate whey that I've had so far. As far as price I think it's very reasonable compared to getting whey from your local complete nutrtion. \n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this because I heard good things about it both from bodybuilding.com and some people I workout with. Birthday cake is a delicious change in flavor from your typical vanilla/chocolate protein flavors. Never had an upset stomach with this stuff and the 5 pound tub is huge. I didn't use this stuff everyday, so it lasted me well over a month and a half. The only downside to this stuff is even with bodybuilding.com's good prices, it's still a little expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great tasting,   Mixes well.   Highly recommend this product\n",
      "\n",
      "Great flavor for after workout. Cinnamon was perfect and not to sweet and reminded me of a cinnamon bun!\n",
      "Great Taste! Pricey but good!\n",
      "Love this product...first time buying this and now I will continue with this one...good taste as well. \n",
      "Excellent whey protein. My favourite one. The taste is amazing. I take this protein for the last 6 months and it helped me drop some weight and body fat. It doesn't give me bloating like other whey proteins I've tried. Comments for the flavours now:\n",
      "\n",
      "Birthday Cake: tastes more like icing rather than cake. Even though I am addicted to cakes, I didn't go crazy on this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies and Cream: it has tiny pieces of cookies inside, would love to have bigger ones or more.  Would prefer to have more cookie flavour rather than cream/milky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fudge Brownie: best flavour ever. It's like you are eating the brownie batter. I give 9 out of 10 because I would love to see some pieces in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gourmet Chocolate: great chocolatey taste. \n",

      "\n",
      "IMO the Vanilla is on point, I go and blow a lot of money trying different types of proteins for the fun of it and IMO its solid, Aside from taste though the profile is solid as well as the company, Dymatize has always been known to make quality products.. They need to make the Cinnamon Bun flavor in a normal 5lb size now so i can buy it regularly, and make a nice peanut butter one would be great 0=)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes well and flavor is amazing. I had orange dreamscicle. Not too sweet but sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth. \n",
      "I recently ordered ISO 100 because of the high protein, low calrories, and very low fat and sugar ratings.  The taste is good, one of the best I've tried, and it's mixture is actually somewhat thick when used with water.  So far I'm very pleased and expect to keep using it.   \n",
      "\n",
      "My number one protein powder. Mixes well, tastes amazing (however fudge brownie I found to be to strong in choc flavour which is great for choc lovers). best of all it digests well for me. Im sensitive to dairy products esp Whey concentrate. This is by far the best Isolate Whey ive tried. Wont try anything else now :)\n",
      "Not too sweet. Flavor is dead on. My favorite iso whey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "this is a very good powder! my favourite till now. the taste is great, except the cookies and cream which is too sweet and mix horribly. the banana and pinacolada are great, and they mix even with a spoon in a cup. the berry is also tasty, little less than those two. mixes as weel as them.\n",
      "\n",
      "i really like that the powder is zero carbs, gluten and lactose. pure whey. close to perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "update- april 2014:\n",
      " i've changed my mind a little bit. i think something happened to this powder. the new red strip on the package says it is a new taste, and it is. but i'm afraid it's not a good change- the pinacolada that used to be my favourite tatse, with the banana (i gave them both 9 prior to this), lost its magic. and it stirs poorly now. why? am i the only one who think like that?\n",
      "Really good protein and an amazing taste!! Not too expensive and get great results! Definitely worth a try! \n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love this product. I love that there is zero sugar and fat. When adding protein as a supplement the last thing I was to add is fat or sugar. The banana flavor is so light as delicious. It tastes like a light smoothie. I only mix it with water and it's perfect. I look forward to my protein shake daily. It satisfies my sweet tooth but doesn't taste like it's packed with sugar. Loveeee and highly recommend this flavor and protein. \n",
      "I'm super picky about the way protein powders taste ands I absolutely love this one, it tastes delish... And I've tried a lot! I just wish they made a peanut butter flavour *wink wink, nudge nudge* lol pleeeeeease \n",
      "As a female who has str****led with weight and finding \"what works,\" I have absolutely fallen in love with this protein. I mix with water and it taste amazing. I'm satisfied and I feel ten times better during the day! One shake in the morning with breakfast and one right after my workout. With not changing my diet(eating 6 portioned meals a day) nor my workout, I can already see a difference. I have also ordered the birthday cake one! Cannot wait to try it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Good additional protein source with BCAAs and almost no carbs!\n",
      "The birthday cake flavor tastes too sweet!\n",
      "This is my favorite protein powder.  I've tried Birthday Cake, Gourmet Vanilla,  Fudge Brownie, and Gourmet Chocolate.  Birthday Cake did taste similar to the real thing but way too sweet for my liking.  Gourmet Vanilla is more mild vanilla and you have the ability to add fruit to make it more sweet to your liking.  Fudge Brownie and Gourmet Chocolate are both excellent but Fudge Brownie just tastes a little bit better.  The protein powder only needs water to mix it truly tastes that good.\n",
      "If you're after protein per serving it's true that you get more from Hydrowhey (30g) compared to ISO-100's 25g. But due to the difference in serving size (for Hydrowhey, most flavours is 39g per serving while a serving of ISO-100 Pina Colada is only 29.1g) we can say ISO-100 is purer (85.9% protein per gram compared to Hydrowhey's 76.9%). Again, this is because of difference in weight per serving of the two. That means for every 100g of Hydrowhey, only 76.9g of it is protein, while there's 85.9g of protein for every 100g of ISO-100. Again, I'm talking about purity here. Now for the taste, I've always rotated between vanilla & chocolate when I used Hydrowhey. When I switched to ISO-100, I wanted to try something different and the Orange Dreamsicle masks that distinct taste/aftertaste of the protein completely, you'll think your drinking a regular smoothie.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff is great. The taste is unreal. Orange dreamsicle tastes like you melted the pop into a cup and put ice cubes in it. Since it is an isolate it dissolves perfectly and it retains the consistency of the water, which I believe is why this tastes even more amazing. Gourmet Chocolate is also a safe bet. Smells like a hot chocolate and is more light brown in color. Both are stupid good. I'll be taking 2-3 scoops a day which increases my protein intake by 50-75g's a day. Finally, I'd like to say I am lactose intolerant and gave up on protein powders for a while after some bad experiences which lactose free proteins(I think concentrates are to blame). I can take this one and be fine. Will continue to purchase as long as I can digest it..\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the best tasting protein powder I had so far. Love it!! Mixes very easily too. \n",
      "Very clean iso product. Felt the muscles were getting fed well. Taste was better than most out there. Overall good protein. \n",
      "Love this product for daytime snacks. The Fudge Brownie flavor is better than most protein products, but I really enjoy drinking the Gourmet Chocolate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is such a great protein powder. I loooove the flavor of birthday cake. The res barely any sugars and its 25g of quality isolate. I dont know how they do it. This stuff is perfect and only 110 cals a scoop!\n",
      "Best protein around! Fast absorbing, disolves well and tastes good. Theres nothing not to like. I've never tried the strawberry or pina colada so I can't comment on those but all the others are great.\n",
      "Great product. I've bounced back and forth with different brands (Gold Standard, MTS Whey) but I found myself going right back to the ISO-100. I bought a tub of the birthday cake and it tastes great, so does the fudge brownie. Not many protein powders taste great when mixed in with plain non-fat yogurt, this definitely does. 10/10 from me ! love it. \n",
      "The Orange flavor is simply excellent!! Mixes easy with Creatine and Water, no lumps or bad after taste. U won't go wrong with this!\n",
      "I have to say that Dymatize is the real deal. I completed my leg exercise yesterday. Which I could barley walk after leaving the gym. Needless to say last week when I completed my leg exercise I was sore for almost a week. This week my legs have recovered fully. I rated this product excellent because it is not hype love the taste to...  \n",
      "I NEVER leave reviews but mann I love this stuff. I've been using this as my go to protein for about 8 months now and every time I leave it for another brand I come back to it. Taste great, great results, easy to mix and blend. Also easy on the stomach. It does get a little foamy from blending but besides that this stuff is AMAZING. If you're on a low carb diet or just need some extra protein in your diet I highly recommend this. Plus, the price for the amount of servings is top of the line for a whey isolate protein. Cookies and Cream and Strawberry are my personal favorites. Won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Without a doubt the most delicious protein flavor i've ever had. Definitely a must buy if you want a very fast digesting protein that is also low in calories. \n",
      "Awesome taste, easy mixability. Along with ON Whey, this one just became a new personal favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I finally decided to buy the first protein in my life I chose this one, because it seemed to be simply the best - pure protein with almost no carbs or fat (0.5g per scoop). It mixes incredibly well even with a spoon. As for the taste... the first shake was a shock for me. Since it was the very first protein in my life I could have never imagined that I would hate chocolate taste (and I love chocolate!). However, with every shake I started liking the taste better and better and now I absolutely love it! I'm happy I didn't write the review after the first shake, because I would definitely give 1/10. Now it's absolutely 10/10. After this protein I have tried different other (PhD, MetRx, BPI) and still I think that ISO-100 by Dymatize is the best! \n",
      "I really like the taste of this protein powder, and it mixes well with water or milk.  A bit pricey, but I don't drink it every day, so it lasts me a little longer.  Worth a try if you're on the fence!\n",
      "Wow, flavors for the Orange Dreamsicle and Cookies & Cream are awesome.  Powder mixes in well - I use a mixture of 8oz water and two tablespoons of half & half.  I found the addition of just a little milk fat makes any grittiness go away without affecting the flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orange Dreamsicle reminds me of the Push-Up Pops I used to get as a kid\n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies & Cream tastes a lot like Oreos\n",
      "\n",
      "I am addicted now!\n",
      "Goes down easy. Amazing flavors, not many negatives about it. A bit pricy, but worth it. \n",
      "This was my first attempt at a protein supplement and I am thoroughly pleased! I saw noticable muscle gains within 6 weeks and I believe I would have seen them sooner, if, I hadn't slacked off in my workouts for 2 weeks. I also did not experience bloating. If you want to see results quickly, get this supplement. Fantastic product.\n",
      "This is a great product, easy to mix, However I didn't like the orange flavor. The most important thing to me is that it has low fat and low carb.\n",
      "This is a very good protein. I use it immediately at the end of my workout and I have a noticeable difference in the amount of soreness i feel vs the days that I don't. The taste is pretty good, I like the vanilla since i can use it as a base for making fruit smoothies. I usually use a wand mixer, but if i have to shake it, it tends to be a little gritty, but not so bad that it's a problem - it's just a noticeable difference vs some others that i've used.\n",
      "This is the best tasting protein powder I have ever had! Mixes very well as well.  I look forward to when it's time to have a shake with this in it.  I take it first thing when I wake up and about 20 or 30 minutes before my workout. It's expensive but to me it's worth every penny.  Love that they break down the aminos and ingredients.  Very straight forward and you know what you are getting.  Great product and don't hesitate to buy especially this flavor.\n",
      "This is a great high quality isolate protein with great taste! \n",
      "Positive: Nice flavor, mix well.\n",
      "Negative:  I had better recovery with Cellucore. \n",
      "this flavor is so amazing. when i cay it tastes JUST LIKE an orange ice cream bar. And this is with water., with milk I don't like it however. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is something that i will definitely purchase again, but first i want to try fudge brownie and birthday cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your thinking about this flavor, you will not regret it. \n",
      "\n",
      "NEVER before have I had a flavor that has tasted so close to the real thing...i love it\n",
      "\n",
      "These guys have the best flavors by far.  I drink their birthday cake protein daily and it never gets old.  Add any fruit to it in a smoothie and it takes it to a whole new level.  I like pineapple and cherry in mine.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes good. Digests well. Does what it says.\n",
      "Ill be honest. For my post workout protein. This is #1 by far. Ingredients and effects. I tried other Isolates when on sale (since Im very price conscious) by nothing compares. You mix with water, it dissolves fast, and you end up drinking it just as fast. Not thick on the pallet or texture, and its on the way to  nourish your muscles. There is a reason why ISO-100 is almost never truly onsale or sold with a bonus, because ITS THAT **** GOOD compared to the competition. If the next competitor is a 9.5, its at eleven.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Very tasty product. Surpasses in taste characteristics of Optimum Nutrition and Ultimate Nutrition. On the efficiency of performance can not make a conclusion as accept no long.\n",
      "I'm Lactose intolerant so my options are very limited. This protein taste amazing and is very effective. I get no bloat and no gas; which I get from other lactose free products. \n",
      "\n",
      "I use this as part of a low carb diet and this is one of the best on the market! Much protein, not so much carbs!\n",
      "Birthday Cake seem to me to be a little to sweet. Smooth banana was much better to me.  I have mixed them 1 scoop of each and that was good. \n",
      "I am very strict when it comes to flavors, and Birthday Cake is just fine for me. It takes like a pubix vanilla cake. I take the shake 30-40 mins after any weight lifting exercise. If your not into chocolate and is tired of just vanilla this is the best flavor for you. Plus it hits the sweet tooth just right. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is really tasty for a protein powder!\n",
      "So far my absolute favorite protein powder. No fat, no added sugar, low sodium, etc...- basically nothing you don't want and everything one could ask for with a whey powder. The fact that it is hydrolyzed helps it to mix extremely well and it also has a great taste and consistency. It would be very hard to tear me away from this product. Currently take two shakes a day.\n",
      "I have had some other proteins in the past (ON, GNC, etc) and this is by far the best one I have had. It mixes extremely well (I use whole milk) and the taste is great (a little on the sweet side), but that's okay with me. What really impresses me is that it has 5.5 g of BCCAs (2:1:1) and the low amount of sugar and fat is outstanding. I'm definitely sticking with Dymatize as my whey protein isolate supplement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gourmet Chocolate is the best tasting chocolate protein I have ever tasted (and I have had sooo many brands). It tastes like hot chocolate mix!\n",
      "Wasn't too thrilled with the Orange Dreamsicle. It has a very artificial and distinctive stevia taste but is a good change from drinking vanilla every day. Looking forward to trying the other flavors!\n",
      "This stuff is just awesome! I've tried a lot of protein powders and this is my second favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: Orange Dreamsicle is awesome! \n",
      "Tried the birthday cake flavor and it's by far one of my fave proteins. I use this instead of vanilla. What exactly is birthday cake flavor anyway? Like vanilla cake frosting? It's low cal and high in protein per serving which is awesome. It mixes well with water. I use this in my iced coffee and oatmeal. Simply amazing.\n",
      "Great product! Tastes great, mixes easily. \n",
      "I personally find this product to be overpoweringly sweet to the point of revulsion. This is the worst tasting protein powder I've ever purchased. Will not buy again. (Fudge brownie)\n",
      "It might just be the flavor that I ordered but this is very sweet for my taste.  I like taking 50 grams of protein post workout and two scoops of the birthday cake was just way too sweet.  I had to cut back to one scoop with a lot of water to get it down.\n",
      "Simply the best for post workout and upon waking. Just look at the label. I personally recommend birthday cake mixed with oats and peanutbutter for the perfect macro shake. Delicious. \n",
      "Only about 5 scoops in to this and I can already tell I'm going to love it. First off it is the easiest mixing protein I have ever used, literally only takes 3 shakes or so and it's all mixed up. The taste is solid, your typical vanilla, nothing to complain about. I also like how the entire amino acid profile measurements are listed on the tub. Also even though this is 1.6 pounds for $28 the serving sizes are not as big as some of the other proteins that have 2 pounds so in my eye it equals out.\n",
      "Great protein and the vanilla taste great!\n",
      "Finally, I have found a protein shake that's easy to mix, excellent quality (low in carbs, calories, sugar, etc), Isolate Whey Protein, & Tastes Amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "Fudge Brownie gives me the dessert fix I need as a chocolate lover! \n",
      "Used this product before, and it made me great gains and also helped me lean out. I stopped using this product for a few months because I just wanted to try out different products such as \"ON Complex Pro\" which is an amazing priduct but so expensive and you only get 20 servings from a 3lb tub. Anyways this Birthday cake flavor is the best tasting protein i've ever had.!!!!\n",
      "I GO AFTER ALL OF THE GUYS HERE WHO RATE THAT TASTE 10 AND 9 AND BECOUSE OF THEM I ORDER IT AND ITS TASTE SO BAD . ITS LIKE SOMETHING FULL IN SUGAR THAT MAKE YOU SICK IN THE FIRST SIP .\n",
      "\n",
      "I ASKING FOR ANY ONE WHO WANT TO ORDER THAT TASTE OF ISO-100 TO UNDOIT ! \n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRODUCT IS FULL OF STEVIA AND BLEND REALLY OUTAGEOUS TO \n",
      "Amazing flavor, and the mix-ability of this product is fantastic!\n",
      "This is my first review ever and I had to do one on this product. The taste is amazing! This is my new favorite flavor and I'll def be buying a bigger tub next time around. I would def recommend to others. \n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE the ISO 100 line from Dymatize.  I have yet to not like any of the flavors I have tried.  Mixes into liquid whether its with a shaker bottle or a blender.  Great amount of protein, low carb and low sugar. \n",
      "Highly recommend.\n",
      "I really enjoy this new Orange Dreamscicle flavor! I simply cannot face another chocolate or vanilla whey iso- This is a very good alternative.\n",
      "Dymatize mixes well and has a great profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes great even when mixed with water. \n",
      "For those of you with digestive problems: this is probably the protein for you.  I have lactose intolerance, and I'm sensitive to almost anything that gives individuals upset stomachs or gas.  Isolated/Hydrolyzed proteins work wonders for me.  \n",
      "With that being stated, Dymatize ISO-100 is my top choice for isolated proteins.\n",
      "Birthday Cake is amazing and amazingly rich.\n",
      "Fudge Brownie is excellent and good for your standard chocolate-type protein.\n",
      "Orange Dreamsicle - I don't know how they did it; but the flavor starts out with an orange taste and ends with the dreamsicle, just as if you were biting into a real orange dreamsicle.  It DESERVES 10 out of 10.\n",
      "AMAZING! I tried the Birthday Cake flavor first and LOVED the taste.. I was running low and was torn on whether to stick with it because it's so good or try another one.. after reading others' reviews I tried Fudge Brownie.  I was so happy when i saw my BB box on my front door.  another HIT! Seriously, curbs my sweets cravings.  Love doing half scoop of each, ice and water, and blending it into a shake.  Best. Protein. Ever.  I'm hooked.  Love the low fat & carb contents -- perfect for pre and post workout! \n",
      "I've constantly used Isolate proteins for my prep and daily needs. With Dymatize's new flavor formula I've been blown away. Not only is it the best tasting protein I've ever had, it's the highest quality as well! Over 85% pure Isolate. Fudge Brownie ranks up top for me, but when I don't want the fat intake, I switch to Orange Dreamsicle and Birthday Cake. Great price too!\n",
      "I have never been a brand loyal person when it came to proteins - there are just so many delicious sounding flavors out there, but I am definitely sticking to Dymatize. This protein doesn't just SOUND delicious - it TASTES amazing. I mix the two together and blended with ice, it truly tastes like the \"birthday cake remix\" ice cream from Coldstone Creamery!! I have purchased so many proteins and they just aren't as good. I have also become more aware of the ingredients and quality of proteins over the course of the year, and this protein has its first ingredient (and only protein source) of Hydrolized Whey Protein Isolate. None of that \"Whey Protein Concentrate\" crap... that is basically like the equivalent of orange juice from concentrate! Beware of the labels, and this protein is definitely all it is cracked up to be!!\n",
      "One of the best tasting proteins I've had.  Reminds me of Orange Julius.  I like the fact that they added Stevia but wished they left out the Sucralose.  Still a wonderful buy.\n",
      "Awesome protein source.  The sweet taste actually causes my sweet tooth to subside.  It's my go to in between meals and just for a delicious snack post workout/prior to bed time.  Definitely seeing muscle gains as a result of adding this to my workouts and other supplementation!\n",
      "I've been using ISO 100 of quite some time now and it's excellent. I really like pretty much all the flavors also which is the added bonus. I just tried the exclusive orange dreamsicle and I think I found my new favorite. I really hope they continue making this flavor\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great protein that mixes easy and tastes great.  It is a thin mixing protein because its a pure isolate but I love it when I need some extra protein because there is close to no carbs and its low in sodium\n",
      "THE LEVEL OF QUALITY, IS TOO **** HIGH!\n",
      "I can say i have tried many many Protein powders and OMG I nearly GASM'd Drinking this, Soooo Delicious! it tasted Great with Milk, \n",
      "did 2 scoops with about 7oz of milk, pure wetness! \n",
      "MOS DEF gonna buy again now im interested in their protein, \n",
      "If need Isolate get this! way worth the money and the Taste! \n",
      "IS Unbelievable! \n",
      "I absolutely love this protein! I have been a die-hard Dymatize fan since it was first recommended to me. I am currently using the \"Fudge Brownie\" flavor as my post workout protein. This protein mixes very well; no clumps, no worries. The taste is phenomenal as well - I look forward to working out knowing that I will get a great shake at the end of it! :-) Fair warning about the Birthday Cake flavor: the texture of the dry protein is a bit different than other flavors. It's a bit thicker and dense but I still love it. On a side note, I have used all of the aforementioned flavors before to bake with and to make \"protein deserts\" (yum!). Overall: Great product & I would recommend this protein to anyone. I am excited to try some new flavors! \n",
      "\n",
      "I HAD NEVER TAKEN PROTEIN SHAKES, BUT I DECIDED TO TRY THEM AND GOT INFORMATION ABOUT PROTEIN FOR PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMS OF BAD CHOLESTEROL (LDL) AND TO HELP PROVIDING BCAAS, AND NOT ME REGRET FOR ANYTHING I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH ITS FLAVOR AND COM IS FEELS TO BE IN THE STOMACH : ) : )\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing Product, amazing flavor i have tried up to 5 flavor most of them are amazing , recommended smooth banana \n",
      "My Favorite Flavor so far, I'm in love with this brand!!!! It mixes good and tastes great. It tastes sugary but thats the part is that there is not sugar!!!!! Love this brand and this flavor!!!\n",
      "Wow! This fudge brownie is so good. I've never felt this guilty drinking a protein shake. I like to blend it with ice, milk and a banana post-workout. \n",
      "I've used ISO 100 for about 2 years and have yet to find a better tasting protein. I love that it's lactose free since I'm lactose intolerant. I used to get gourmet chocolate, but fudge brownie is a little better IMO. They both taste great however. I also love that there is very few additives in it, unlike some other protein powders they dont add all of the other BS. It's about as close to straight whey protein as you can get. I definitely recommend this protein to anyone. I'm a huge Dymatize fan and will continue to buy this product as well as their casein (cinnamon bun is fantastic). \n",
      "Great clean protein, I mix it (when need be) with casein cinnabun dymatize, and man the taste is insanely good. Its a nice clean product no gas or bloating and i can feel the effects of its purity after i lift it helps refuel and repair fast and noticed some pretty good fat loss and muscle gain while using it. Anyone looking for a solid clean whey product this is a must\n",
      "\n",
      "I got this from a recommendation from a friend because I wanted to try something new.  This has 110 calories per serving and 25. The amino acid content. Is also  listed on the container which is nice.  The flavor is also wonderful and  \" taste like summer\" as  another reviewer said.  I will buy this again! \n",
      "\n",
      "Dymatize ISO is one of the best brands of protein powder I've used.... Definitely the best tasting! Birthday cake literally tastes like a piece of vanilla cake shoved in a blender. But be aware- it's pretty darn sweet and that could be off putting to some. My husband didn't like that at all.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10/10 for macros and quality and price for this protein, it is all A+\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste:\n",
      "birthday cake- yuck I honestly didn't taste anything close to a cake flavor and it has a weird chemical taste after you swallow it all done, I didn't buy a tub but was given 3 sample packets\n",
      "fudge brownie- yuck I honestly didn't taste anything close to a cake flavor and it has a weird chemical taste after you swallow it all done, I didn't buy a tub but was given 3 sample packets\n",
      "chocolate- best bet and tastes good!\n",
      "Great protein. Mixes very easy in the bottle. Doesn't require electronic blender\n",
      "Birthday cake is amazing. I just want to drink the whole container dymatized nailed the flavor on this one . The orange Popsicle is amazing to highly recommend \n",
      "This is the best flavor I've ever had! They really need to give me some money since I've got all my friends drinking it, lol. But for real this awesome. Finally I don't dread drinking a shake. I actually look forward to it\n",
      "This is by far the best protein powder I've ever tried. This was my 3rd brand and the first to NOT clump up. The other brands I had would still be clumpy after 1-2 minutes shaking (I don't have a fancy shaker with the ball). This stuff takes less than 30 seconds to dissolve completely while others would still have several small clumps after more than a minute. The chocolate flavor is very good, rich and smooth. As for the results, I've only been using this for a month so the jury is still out. Maybe it's the placebo effect but I \"feel\" better than I did with the others, so take it as you will.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Birthday Cake...AWESOME!!! LOVED it! ISO-100 has always been my favorite protein after all the years of trying everything under the sun. You can't go wrong with it.  Birthday Cake is 10/10 flavor, Fudge Brownie 9/10 (tastes exactly like hot chocolate!), Cookies & Cream 6/10, Vanilla 7/10, Regular Chocolate 7/10...and I haven't tried the other flavors.  Ever since they reformulated it, its been a BIG miss on the new flavors. But the new Birthday Cake and Fudge Brownies were HITS!!!  I can't wait to try the Orange Dreamsicle. \n",
      "My favorite flavor is Orange Dreamsicle.  After a workout I like to put with half orange gatorade/half water and oats. So delicious and refreshing!! I originally was using the vanilla flavor, but this has made it even better. \n",
      "\n",
      "I haven used only the best protein in the world so far and I can say this can compete with fudge brownie....just needs a little bit more creamy flavor to it....I love this because I love orange creamsicles \n",
      "This is the best tasting protein I have ever tried! It mixes easily in a shaker and really does taste like brownie batter. It doesn't have any of the chemical after taste like some protein powders do. \n",
      "The first protein, which I tried. Perfect taste and digestion.\n",
      "The birthday cake flavor is horrible and too sweet, nothing special at all and don't know where 9.6 rating came from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fudge brownie is much palatable and not overtly sweet.  \n",
      "Great taste and mixes very well...the Birthday cake is the best tasting whey I have had to date.\n",
      "Great taste. Works great. Easy to mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes great and doesnt give me the bloat.  Pretty good protein for after workout\n",
      "This has been a great protein to consume right before lifting or right after for quick digestion. It is delicious as well.\n",
      "Great taste. Low calories and fat compared to many other whey proteins. Fast acting. Shows you exactly what you are getting and comes with a lot of bcaa's as well as other non & semi essential aminos. Only whey protein I buy.\n",
      "The taste of Dymatize ISO-100 birthday cake is unique. I have not had a shake like this before. I am so glad the reviewers helped me to make this choice so I wanted to give back by writing a review myself. The reviews were spot on, it is like vanilla but much more sweeter and actually tastes like a birthday cake. I even felt like drinking the icing on the cake. :)\n",
      "As for the powder, it mixes completely well with a spoon. I tried it in milk as I am bulking.  It went down real smooth and no GI issues so far. I did not expect it to be this good. I am very satisfied with my purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "It helps me keep up with my macro intake. It is in my kitchen waiting for me. I let it is for 2-3 minutes to ensure it is lump free.\n",
      "Birthday cake and fudge brownie both are amazing with just water. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ive had it all when it comes to protein. this is literally the best low carb protein available, possibly the best overall protein shake. not only does it mix smoother and easier than any other protein on the market, but tastes amazing, will never get tired of the taste you can have 9 shakes a day a still love it.. tastes just like chocolate milk. 24g protein per 28g scoop what more can u ask for. NEW FUDGE BROWNIE FLAVOR IS INCREDIBLE\n",
      "These proteins are as advertised. They mix very well with milk and/or water. They taste amazing and the profile is hard to beat. Th birthday cake is my favorite it tastes amazing. \n",
      "This is by fay my favorite Whey Protein Isolate, but I wish they would take the Sucralose out. I used the Gourmet Chocolate for about a year and a half before they \"Improved\" the taste.... they should have left it alone! It is now WAY too sweet!! I tried the vanilla and it is really good (wish I would have tried it before the change) The vanilla is great because I can mix it with chocolate, white or almond milk, orange juice or water. It always taste great. Post workout I use a 1/4 cup of ice, 2 scoops of vanilla iso-100, 5g L-glutimine, 5oz orange juice and 3oz water. Put it in my NutriBullet and it taste like an Orange Julius!\n",
      "The only downside is that they are using Sucralose as a sweetener. I am trying other (More Natural) Whey Protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one it's much better than the Elite . I don't why but it dissolves better. NO ***** like Elite . It's good.\n",
      "Definitely my favorite protein of all time. Mixes extremely well and you get a lot more protein for your dollar over other brands. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to build or maintain muscle for sure. I never get gas or an upset stomach with this protein. Smooth Banana is the best flavor!\n",
      "I absolutely love this protein.  My local supplement store clerk recommended this brand because of the low sugar and how smooth it is.  This is the best protein I have found hands down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strawberry tastes like Nestle Quick Strawberry and Gourmet Chocolate is great as well.  Everything is so light and easy to drink.\n",
      "For the longest I was a big ON Whey fan (still am);  however, this protein is my new number one. It satisfies my three big categories. This protein mixes very easily with no clumps. I honestly don't need a shaker or ball to mix this up. The taste is in a category by itself. The conspiracy theorist side of thinks this might not be a protein shake but a very delicious desert. Most importantly, it works. I am not full, bloated, or gaseous like I am sometimes with ON. Taking this after a hard workout or in the morning has definitely helped me with my recovery (noticeable recovery difference compared to ON).  \n",
      "This stuff taste amazing, I've been using straight chocolate for the most part and decided it was time to add in extra flavors to help the cravings during contest prep and this really takes the cake. You will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Taste on all: awesome (might even be a little too sweet for some. So good!)\n",
      "However, my stomach had a hard time processing it. \n",
      "Which is awful because it not only tastes great (vanilla, choc., birthday cake) but it also bakes/cooks great too (I make pancakes, cake, muffins, etc)\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the best tasting protein I have ever tried,  low carb for us ketoers,  and mixes so well! I look forward to my post workout shake, its probably my favorite part of my whole day! \n",
      "Great product. Tastes like strawberry flavored candy, but not too strong.\n",
      "Love the fact Iso 100 is 100% hydrolized isolates. Birthday cake was delicious. \n",
      "I only buy chocolate protein powder, but this cake is rich.  2nd ISO I've tried, very happy with the bare-bones structure and performance.  I will be buying it again.\n",
      "I have been a long time Dymatize ISO-100 customer, but I'm not loving the improved or new flavors.  Super sweet with a funky after taste.  BUT, flavor is subjective.  What I like may be totally different from someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently tried ISOPure, and I think ISO-100 is still better.\n",
      "After being a long time customer of Dymatize I thought that I would give the Iso-100 a try. Unfortunately I ended up feeling bloated after drinking this, which I really don't like. The birthday cake exclusive is also way too sweet. I guess you could add some nuts or something to tone the sweetness down. I won't be buying again though. I'm moving on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Update: Not long after the bloating kicked in I ended up in the bathroom. My stomach was upset and within an hour I ended up with a headache. I stayed home instead of going to the gym.\n",
      "I love Dymatize ISO-100. At first I was a little worried that I was switching from Optimum whey because I trust them. After reading some reviews and many many videos on product reviews, I decided to give it a try. The first time I tasted it, it was amazing. I have never tasted a protein that was nearly as good. It is a very clean protein and I trust the company more than ever. I love this product and recommend it to all my friends. In my opinion, this is, BY FAR the best protein on the market. Buy this now.\n",
      "This by far is one of the best tasting proteins I have ever had. Not to mention the low fat content is amazing. The only thing I wish it had more of is fiber like in their Elite Fusion 7 series. \n",
      "Dymatize ISO-100 is one of the best proteins on the market.  It mixes really well and with zero lactose, sugar, low carbs, fat and 25 grams of protein makes it a winner. Vanilla and banana are my favorite flavors. It is a little expensive as but as they say \"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR\"! \n",
      "I would give this product 9 points! Because there is no limit to perfection ... There is always something to strive for! I liked the taste and texture! I recommend!\n",
      "Birthday Cake is my new favorite flavor ever!!! So good. \n",
      "This **** is amazing. Best tasting protein powder, by far.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely one of the best iso proteins on the market right now. Very few cabs, practically no sugars and BCAAs. The Birthday Cake flavor is amaazziinngg, I've tried the rich chocolate before, and it was good--but birthday cake is DEFINITELY my favorite. I mix it with unsweetened almond milk (which helps play up the birthday cake flavor even more) for my shakes.\n",
      "Awesome product for contest prep. Low carbs, low cal, with high protein. Great taste :)\n",
      "Birthday cake is the most delicious protein ever! I mix it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk and its like drinking a milkshake. \n",
      "The Birthday Cake flavor is seriously so amazing!! \n",
      "I'm in love with this flavor!! \n",
      "It's expensive but the best.\n",
      "It mixes great just with water and tastes great!! I can't wait to start making it into a smoothie now that I know it tastes so good with just water. \n",
      "\n",
      "Really good flavor. kind of tastes a little like vanilla but with more flavor.  doesnt get all clumpy either when you shake it in shaker bottle. quality product being that there are very few ingredients making it more pure than others. overall rating a 10. will order again. its even much cheaper on here than anywhere else ive checked\n",
      "Just tried my first shake of the 'Fudge Brownie' flavor. The best tasting protein shake I've ever had. It's absolutely phenomenal.  With it's high quality ingredients, I'm thinking this will be my go-to protein supplement. VERY VERY GOOD!\n",
      "Definitely one of the best protein powders I've ever used. Amazing taste and blends really well!\n",
      "Taste great! Good price! Digest fast!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this Iso 100 it's one of the best proteins I've ever tasted, I'm not really sore the next day after intense workouts, and it mixes well in almost anything especially my morning cereal with  Almondmilk Vanilla of course. It may cost a Little more then the average but it's worth it and my stomach Thanks me for it...\n",
      "Worst flavor I have ever had in a protein powder and I have tried them all, I didn't care about flavor until I got syntha six and I realized I could have protein and flavor and now I can't go back to this chalk.\n",
      "By far the best protein isolate u can buy. I purchased the cookies and cream and it is top notch. Zero sugars and no lactose is great for anyone that is lactose intolerant. Highly recommended I promise u will not be disappointed \n",
      "Very good protein, mixes well.  I did not give the fudge brownie a 10 because it didn't taste like brownie to me, but it was very good.  It just tasted like a rich chocolate shake to me.  However the birthday cake did taste like birthday cake and was absolutely delicious.  Definitely helps with sweet tooth cravings and still lets you manage your sugar intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this protein, by far best tasting protein among the top sellers. I really like the banana flavor however I just received the exclusive fudge brownie today and it's my new favorite. You can't go wrong trying a case of this stuff. \n",
      "The Fudge Brownie is too legit to quit. It's a hard for me to decide my favorite flavor between this and the Birthday Cake, but since I am a chocolate lover I'll have to go with the Brownie. The flavor profile is far better than their Gourmet Chocolate which is already great in its own right. I'm glad I got the 5 pounder. Hopefully Dymatize will keep both of these \"exclusive\" flavors for good. \n",
      "I was getting tired of the traditional flavors and this really did the trick!  I crave proteins shakes now.  I am one that is always fighting a sweet tooth, and now I can cheat clean as often as I want!\n",
      "This one has a very nice flavor. Mixes so easily. Enjoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this to avoid the ON hype, also because it came in at the cheapest, highest recommended Whey. I have tried many Whey proteins and this one is the best so far. \n",
      "It mixes incredibly easily with water or milk, no lumps whatsoever too.\n",
      "As mentioned, its cheap which is a plus for me as i get through 2 whey shakes daily.\n",
      "The taste is brilliant, there is a slight tang to it but this is only noticable with water. Milk takes this tang away and adds a bit more sweetness. Best tasting chocolate whey protein i've ever had.\n",
      "I also like the fact its very low on carbs and has no fat so can be easily added to fit my macros.\n",
      "After buying some ON whey  i think this is actually better.\n",
      "This USED to be my favourite protein but they changed the flavour. (Now has the red band in top) The vanilla now tastes absolutely horrible.  I don't know why they messed with a good thing. \n",
      "ISO-100 has always been my go to protein for a post workout shake. I love that it is low in calories, has 5.5 grams of BCAA, is a quality isolate, and has such a small ingredients list compared to other proteins. Gourmet chocolate was my favorite, until I tried the 2 new flavors. Birthday cake is very good, it mixes well but it is pretty sweet. I made protein pancakes with them this morning and they were delicious. I will continue to buy this flavor to bake with. Fudge brownie is AMAZING. It is simply the best tasting protein I have ever tried, on par with Syntha 6 flavors, but the lower calories and the type of protein make the ISO-100 a much more reasonable protein for me (especially while in competition prep) . It mixes well (I just mixed in water) and truly smells and taste like a brownie. When I trained today I was looking forward to my fudge brownie protein shake afterwards:)! \n",
      "I love Dymatize protein. I wish they didn't use artificial sweetners but it's still one of the cleaner proteins out there. I've tried almost all of the flavors and they are all good tasting, but the Fudge Brownie is the best! \n",
      "The original vanilla tasted much better this one tastes more like french vanilla.\n",
      "I have to say, I have never tried dymatize iso protein before, but when I saw they had a new flavor called fudge brownie, I had to try it.  All I can tell you is that this stuff is extremely delicious, and mixes perfectly.  It reminds me of syntha-6 chocolate cake batter, but even better!  The best part, in my opinion, is that there is a very short ingredients list, and it includes steiva.  So I'm guessing that it has less artificial sweeteners than other proteins, but this doesn't sacrifice the taste at all.  I mix mine in water normally and it is still sweet enough, so I'm sure in milk it's even tastier.  Also works great in oats.  \n",
      "Thanks dymatize!\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT:  I forgot to rate the flavor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes Bomb!\n",
      "This is by far the best tasting protein I have ever had. It broke down no problem in water after I shook it a bit. It made every other protein I've had in the past taste horrible in comparison. All my friends are jealous now hahah, they better not steal any...\n",
      "Mixed well, great taste and feel my muscles are being fed quickly after activities which includes the gym. I don't feel as sore days and days later.\n",
      "I have recently returned to taking protein after roughly ten years. I remember ten years ago it was hard to find good tasting protein that mixed well. I was completely blown away when I tasted my gourmet vanilla protein. It tastes great and mixes very well with water, milk, or soy milk. Even my kids liked it and as a parent you know, when it is kid approved it must taste good.\n",
      "I have no complaints at all.\n",
      "I completely don't understand why they needed to supposedly \"improve\" the taste when it was already so delicious. Now it has your typical nasty protein powder taste plus you have to put a little more into the regular serving. Way to drop the ball Dymatize. I was loyal buyer of this but this is goodbye. \n",
      "Best protein powder I've sampled taste-wise.  Nothing else has come close.  And a really good bang for your buck.  Keeps me full too!\n",
      "\n",
      "Profil wise this is my favorite protein powder! And these two new flavors... mhmmm they're delicious haha can't believe that this shake only has 110kcal and tastes that good! My new go to Protein! \n",
      "I love ISO-100 pre and post workout! It's light and doesn't cause any bloating which is great, since I hate having that heavy feeling right before I hit the gym. The last flavor I bought (Banana) tasted ok but was wayyy too foamy for me to enjoy. This seems to be the only flavor I have tried that does this though. As for the Birthday Cake, I really liked the flavor! I don't think it tasted like cake, but more like a better tasting sweet vanilla...Awesome to kill a nagging craving! I think My favorite has to be the Fudge Brownie...It's amazing. It's better than the Gourmet Chocolate, and I didn't think that was possible. \n",
      "I tried this out literally about 5 minutes ago when I finished my training session.  \n",
      "2 scoops of this, wow, tastes extremely good.  Kinda sweet but I'm not complaining.  It's like a birthday cake frosting flavor.  Very surprised based on how clean this protein is!  \n",
      "Trying the Fudge Brownie flavor tomorrow, will post that review as well :)  \n",
      "This is the first whey protein i've taken consistently for almost a year now. It doesn't get any simpler than this protein. Low calorie, hydrolized whey for extremely fast absorption, simple label and ingredients, what more could you ask for? This product has helped me gain muscle notably, but one thing I can say is that the sweetener used in this protein can take some getting used to. Gourmet chocolate tastes way too sweet in my opinion, and gets extremely overwhelming on the pallet even when I blend it with almond milk. Cookies and cream is more pleasant in taste in my opinion. They truly mean it when they say that this product is designed for quick absorption. I get hungry rather quickly after having this shake post-workout. \n",
      "I've tried many different whey protein brands and flavours but, none of the previous ones taste or acts as fast as this one. \n",
      "Hydrolyzed Whey, Gluten free and lactose free.\n",
      "Gourmet Chocolate...if you like chocolate this is the one. \n",
      "I'm on my 2nd 5LB and I'm impress how quick this act in your body, fuelling up your muscles without delay, helping u recover like if nothing happened, and the results, if u work really hard, you'll be impressed how much muscle weight u can gain in just a few months. Thanks Dymatize! \n",
      "the taste is actually good and the gains that i have been getting are also good when miking don't go over 5-6 ounces because if you do it will taste really watery. \n",
      "\n",
      "The birthday cake might be my new fav it taste is good and it goes down easy the fudge brownie is next on my list \n",
      "\n",
      "Vey good for me right not on my contest prep. Nice, lean protein that mixes well and tastes awesome. I bought a small tub of the birthday cake just to try it and will be ordering a 5 pound tub here soon, they nailed it with this flavor. And the gourmet vanilla is great too just a little generic but I use it to cook and bake with. All around great product especially if cutting or in contest prep.\n",
      "One of the best tasting proteins I've ever had! It's a bit sweet but very good!\n",
      "Order the new flavor last night after receiving the email from bb and received it today..Taste like real birthday cake and my daughter even liked the taste. Like all the Iso proteins its less than 1 carb and low on sugar.. loaded with all the goodness of bcaa's. Definately satisfied my sweet tooth today, no bloating no cramps. Mixed easily with unsweetened Almond Milk,  a new fav addition to my Dymatize supps. Not a dense powder like some and doesnt swell fast when mixed with liquid. If you havent tried the Cookies n Cream its just as good. I recover well from all their protein products. Ordering another canister this week because Im sure I will run through this one by months end. \n",
      "I just received the new Birthday cake flavor and it's a bomb.  It taste way better than their original gourmet vanilla. Great product, great nutrition profile and great price. \n",
      "I just recently started using this protein as it is low calorie and virtually fat-free. The Birthday Cake flavor is amazing. Think of eating a certain cake-batter flavored ice cream from a chain ice cream place....that's what it tastes like. If you don't like super sweet things, than this probably wouldn't be the flavor for you.\n",
      "    Cookies and cream is sweet as well, but not too much. It dissolves super easily in a shaker bottle with water. \n",
      "        The pi�a colada is also great! Cannot wait to try it blendedw/some crushed ice.\n",
      "       I've been mixing these all with just plain water. They're not thick, but even with water, the consistancy and sweetness are just fine. \n",
      "     I take a shake after my workouts. \n",
      "Absolutely amazing product! I've ordered several tubs over the past year and this brand easily the best cost and taste wise. Mixability is great, you just have to let it sit for a moment so the foam goes down. Banana is my absolute favorite.\n",
      "I must say that both flavors tasted awesome and satisfied my cravings.  The powder mixes really well with water.  I have been taking this product for two months now and I am seeing some major strength gains even though my main goal is to loose weight.  I take this product after every workout and sometimes if don't have time to make a meal.  I think this product is awesome and would highly recommend.  Thanks for make such and awesome protein Dymatize.\n",

      "I was originally taking Dymatizes Elite Mass Gainer which I loved but was putting on a little more weight than desired. After reading the reviews on this product I decided to give it a try, seeing as one scoop is not even close to the amount of calories in the Mass Gainer and the protein content is still high with one scoop. I was worried about the flavors being gross after reading other peoples reviews that the \"new and improved\" flavors were quite the opposite. I got Gourmet Chocolate and I have to say it is quite yummy. I take about a scoop and a 1/2 and mix with water and it tastes pretty good. The price is a bit steep but you get what you pay for. Love this product and will definitely continue to purchase in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I really don't have to say much if you know anything about protein powders this is absolutely the best in terms of straight protein products \n",
      "The texture r is smooth and creamy and flavor is great.  This new product will replace my previous whey due to much better taste, fewer carbs/calories as well as added benefit of BCAAs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the new strawberry flavor is horrible, they should have left the original Wild Berry Flavor that tasted more like strawberry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies and Cream has a great flavor.\n",
      "Great protein.  It's my go to whey, especially while i'm in a cutting phase.  Mixes fast and well, never clumps.  The chocolate flavor is heavenly and what I like the best about this protein is how easy it is to digest.  Its thinnner than most other brands and goes down smooth like fat free milk.  Strawberry is also a delicious flavor and is one of the few berry flavored proteins that I stick to.  Can't go wrong with this especially if you're looking for  a clean low carb whey.  I also like to mix this with Dymatize Casein for after workout shakes and occasionally before bed, personal preference since I don't care to stomach straight casein, any flavored whey with vanilla casein is perfect.\n",
      "My wife first tried Dymatize at a friends house. She was talking about how good it was and didn't even need a blender and taste good with just water. So I bought some and loved it. \n",

      "I've been using this product since March of 2013 and I love everything about it. My Rating is more of a rant than anything. I just picked up a new 5lbs. container of my favorite flavor, gourmet vanilla. I was surprised to see that Dymatize has decided to \"improve\" the flavor. While not bad, I think that I preferred the old taste better. The new is not bad and it may be because I was used to the other flavor of vanilla. I also noticed that the powder seems to be a much finer ground than before. It still dissolves into water great, as before. I'm sure that I'll get used to the taste over time. Still a great product and I'll continue to use. \n",
      "\n",
      "The best tasting whey isolate i've tasted.  It has a rich chocolate flavor and is satisfying for the sweet tooth.  Also makes great pancakes!  Absolutely delicious!  \n",
      "I so loved this product, not just due to how well it's made but also how it mixes and the taste yet as of my last order I received the \"New Improved Taste\" for both Vanilla and Smooth Banana.  I must say that this \"New Improved Taste\" destroyed the product for me.  Yes it's still a very good protein yet if this new taste makes me dislike drinking my protein mixes then it's almost useless.  I gave vanilla a 3 which is the lowest score I can give and still drink it since I would feel so guilty wasting the money, at a score of 2 it would be bad enough to just junk.\n",
      "Then there is also the powder itself.  It use to mix so well yet now resembles damp beach sand and is a bother to prepare.\n",
      "Once again, as far a the protein structure - it's a 9.5\n",
      "I love this protein! I've tried and few different brands of proteins and I always come back to this one. I'm afraid to try and stray away again. This protein mixes perfectly with water. Chocolate is my fav flavor so far. \n",
      "This stuff is amazing!!!  The flavor is great and it mixes well.  It has a good amount of protein in 1 scoop/serving.  Great for a post workout drink.\n",
      "This is the best tasting powder I have found. Have not tried any other flavors other than Gourmet Chocolate. Easy on my stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I would of rated this higher, but since they changed the formula the taste is off.   Great product...i have been using ot for 2 years....but there is something going on with the flavor.  Last tib i got did not taste sweet at all.  Anyways bodybuilder.com couldnt. Resolve my issue... I had to pay to ship bad,   My s****estion buy it from a local store if you choose this product.  Otherwise you get stuck with shipping charges.\n",
      "The vanilla flavor is DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont know why it had such a good rating i bought this s a safety net since the last chocolate protien i bought was by dymatize it was the elite protein and tasted nasty too the vanilla mixes instantly but is disgusting so sweet i had it once with milk and it just tatsed sweet as f so i started having it with water and it tasted a lil better damm second bad expierence with dymatize and i cant exchange it for another flavor since bb makes me pay for shipping which will result in a loss of profit for me but a 10 since the protien itself mixes easily is a good clean one just horrible flavor  PLEASE BE KNOWLEDGABLE WHEN YOU RATE THE FLAVORS\n",
      "Dymatize makes an excellent series if hydrolyzed whey. The macros are much better than a lot of other products out there and the flavors don't have any chemical aftertaste. I loved the gourmet chocolate, and it mixes well with oats. The banana flavor is another great choice if you want something besides the standard chocolate and vanilla. This product is definitely worth buying.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the fast absorption and the taste is good although since they \"improved\" the flavour i think gourmet vanilla is not as good as it used to be.\n",
      "Its a very lean protein for putting on muscle while keeping carb, fat, calorie, and sugar intake low.\n",
      "This was recommended to me a couple years ago and i have tried other proteins since then and I have come back to the best: ISO 100!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried several different whey protiens and I think this is one of the best tasting.  The serving size is a great bang for your buck.  It mixes extremely well and does not leave a naste after taste in your mouth.\n",
      "Only based on new improved flavor.....\n",
      "\n",
      "As seen on main page for this product....\n",
      "\n",
      "\"â¢Joe Flacco - the year that Joe Flacco came to Dymatize is also the year he led his team to become champions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bring back the old formula cause not only does it suck now but Flacco sucked this year, the long term effects are being being seen and he is not getting better and you did not improve the product.\n",
      "SIMPLY THE BEST. Once you go Hydrolyzed Whey you will NEVER go back to ISO whey. this stuff is extremely fast absorbing. it does not stay in your belly almost instant transport your muscle tissue. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. I have been using iso100 for almost ONE 1/2 YEAR now and i can tell you its my ONLY choice when it comes to Whey Protein. The bonus is that the Vanilla taste really good and it MIXES instant too. Would not have reach my goals without this product. thank you Dymatize for a SOLID product. \n",
      "In my opinion this is the best protein. For a long time I was using ON Whey protein but I wanted change. I tried this about 6 months ago and results are great. The taste is fantastic and it mix very well. Just bought ON Whey and I regret it big time. When I finish it I will definitely back to Dymatize. \n",
      "\n",
      "This product was fantastic.  If you're looking for a good post workout shake to build lean muscle this is a good choice.  The taste, smooth banana, is great--especially for a hydro which is known to taste like garbage.  Texture is smooth and fine with water (may want to add around 12oz despite directions to help mix it since half turns to foam).  Really great product--only switched to try something different for fun but will probably be back.\n",
      "Huge fan until the \"new improved taste\" change. Taste very chemically now. Don't bother. You will be forcing yourself to choke it down. \n",
      "\n",
      "I like the fact that it's low in calories, however, the taste isn't great.  It has a very artificial taste but it's ok if you want something low in calories as most types of low cal protein drinks will taste artificial.  Mixes well in shaker bottle.  Tastes ok in oatmeal.\n",
      "I'm not sure why they changed their original formulas..??? The \"New and Improved version\" of the cookies and cream is not nearly as good as the original. It actually leaves that aftertaste. I've been a big fan and consumer of the original cookies and cream formula. Now, with the improved taste version, I'll be shopping around for a new brand. Very disappointed!!\n",
      "Best protein powder I have ever used. Very high protein content, large amounts of servings per tub, great taste, and low fat and carb count. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mix-ability is absolutely insane. If you take a look at its ingredients, it doesn't contain amino spiking (adding filler amino acids that our body has no need for such as taurine). \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the taste, the Pina Colada wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, but I found that it was just what I was looking for after a workout. Nothing too heavy, rich, or sweet. I could taste the Pina Colada, but it wasn't overwhelming. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although ISO-100 may seem pretty expensive, note that one tub also generally contains more servings than any other brand of protein, making it cost efficient. \n",
      "I am a recent convert to Dymatize ISO-100.  I've only tried the Gourmet Vanilla and the Banana flavor and like both.  This is the BEST HYDRO whey protein that I've ever used.  Others my claim to be the No. 1 selling product on the market.  Just because you sell a lot, doesn't mean you're the best, simply means you sell your product at a cheap price.  I care what I put in my body.   I like Hydro because enzyme have been added that speeds up the digestive process as well as making it easier to digest.  This is critical for you first consumption of protein as soon as you wake up in the morning, pre-workout, and especially post workout. \n",
      "Amazing mixing abilities.  Great tasting!  So far I have used the Banana, Gourmet Chocolate, and the cookies and creme.  Has very low sodium, and high protein content.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "ISO 100 is a staple in my diet. Out of all brands and types of protein powder that I have tried, ISO 100 mixes the best and has a wonderful flavor with little to no after taste. Not only do I use ISO 100 as my go to for post work out protein shakes but every morning I add a scoop to my coffee and then enjoy over ice as a low cost high protein alternative to a coffee shop drink.  The calorie and protein content fit perfectly with my meal plan and I plan on using ISO 100 for a long time to come.\n",
      "This is a wonderful tasting product, this is coming from someone who does not like chocolate. I mix this with 6-8oz of water and top it off with coffee. Step aside Starbucks because I have found a better, healthier, and tastier mocha.\n",
      "I also use the gourmet vanilla for my oatbran and anything for breakfast that requires flavor. \n",
      "This was a great product for me! At the time i was looking to gain muscle and lose fat when i was on this, and it did just the trick! first i lost 5 lbs before i started gaining again. this made me sad but then i realized that i lost fat and gained muscle! This is the best grams of protein per scoop ratio i have seen! the only downside is the weird after taste it puts in your mouth at first. I got past that and loved this product ever since. the only reason i stopped taking it is because im bulking now and am looking for a more suitable protein.\n",
      "Banana is the best flavor, tastes of vanilla for some reason but in a good way. Mixes easily with water or milk, goes down smoothly. Great protein ratio, Wish there'd be a true building version of this...\n",
      "taste great mixes well\n",
      "I've been using this protein for about 6 weeks now with fantastic results.  Definitely my \"go to\" protein!\n",
      "This product used to be my favorite protein powder but they have recently changed the formula and their \"New and Improved Taste\" is heavy on the aftertaste in Vanilla at least. I'm not sure if this is because they've messed with or added sweeteners or what. I blend it into a smoothie everyday to hide the aftertaste but on the rare chance I do blender bottle it with water, it tastes way worse than it used to. I have also baked with it, it doesn't seem to move the aftertaste flavor into the baked good, but I'm a little disappointed. It mixes a little clumpier than the old formula and this also disappointed me. I might try another flavor. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!!!!!!!\n",
      "I've only tried a handful of different protein powders, but this one is awesome. When using other types of protein, my stomach would get pretty upset and I'd feel super bloated, even if I mixed it with water instead of milk. ISO-100 never upsets my stomach. The \"new and improved\" flavor, however, is awful (for vanilla, at least). Not only does it have a strange type of artificial sweet flavor, but it doesn't mix as well, either. It's a lot stickier and makes gooey clumps in my drink. Go back to the old flavor!\n",
      "The chocolate flavor is probably the best protein powders I have ever used. Great taste and no stomach issues. The banana is down right gross. \n",
      "This is by far my go to protein. I have varied brands in the past but nothing gets me the gains or the recovery like ISO. I started using this after doing a lot of research and I was not disappointed. In my opinion it is in a league of its own as far as effectiveness and most of all taste. I recommend this to my clients, my friends and anyone that gives the age old question of \"dude, what are you taking.\" Hands down the best bang for your buck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly one of the best proteins powders I have ever tried (and i've tried almost all of them). Mixes great and taste amazing! Yea it's a little pricey but I guess you gotta pay for quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing protein! this is the best ISO, the Pi�a Colada is excellent with water & ice, really fresh! totally recomended\n",
      "I bought this is gourmet vanilla, and ew, I couldn't drink it. Not while holding my nose. Not with peanut butter in it. Not in a box, with a fox, etc... but maybe vanilla just isn't for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bodybuilding is awesome with costumers, however, so I'm in the process of making the easy switch to the chocolate flavor because the nutrition on ISO-100 is what I'm really looking for and I want to give it another try.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great selection of protein, ever since I tasted this protein, I have stuck to it. The nutritional benefits one gets from it is top notch. For example. protein wise per serving this product rates highest. Also, given the caloric count and protein per serving of this product, one can see that when compared to other products, this product rates highest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this isolate whey protein! Definitely what I use to maintain throughout the year, and in my opinion when you are trying to lean out (especially for women) this protein does it for you. Besides the numbers for nutrition are fantastic! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Iso 100 is still my favorite protein powder. I just tried the strawberry this time-mixes great, tastes great. Just needs alittle more strawberry flavor. But I can always add some frozen strawberries or my zero cal strawberry syrup to make it stronger. It is still a yummy pick!\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed the scoop sizes haven't been consistent and it would be nice if it was consistent between the flavors. Scoops have ranged from 70cc to 90cc. This one came with a longer handle-I don't find the longer handle makes much difference to me, just easier to find the scoop when you first get the container. \n",
      "Really great shake for post workout. I do prefer Scitec ISO GREAT still though. I but this when i can't get the ISO GREAT or when this is on offer as both offer great hydrolized whey percentages.\n",
      "\n",
      "the Scitec just tastes a lot better and there's no soya oil etc added too.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all great protein.\n",
      "In first place, I want to say that I am a big fan of ISO100. I have already tasted the banana flavor, the vainilla favor and the cookies and cream flavor. Cookies and Cream flavor is delicious and it is my favorite. If you want to be ripped and sheddred, I highly recommend you to get this amazing clean and tasteful protein. \n",
      "\n",
      "PS: I take 2 scoops of cookies and cream flavor protein with 250ml Soy milk. \n",
      "Dymatize ISO-100 is great and I brought Cookies and Cream taste is bad but Chocolate out of stock has been. I love Chocolate taste is the best than other one. Do you know mix with skim milk is the best taste than water.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome Whey Protein. Whey Isolate which can help you build muscles. One of the greatest Whey Proteins I have used. Absolute neccesity for anyone  working out. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using this protein for a couple years and I love it. For someone who is lactose intolerant, ISO-100 works perfectly with 0 upset. I swear by it and would recommend it to anyone looking to reach their fitness goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, with this newly advertised \"Improved Taste\" bs, I can't say I agree. I would prefer if they brought the original taste back. If it's not broken, don't fix it, right? The original Gourmet Vanilla was one of the reasons I never strayed to another protein brand. Now, it reminds me of another whey out there that's too sweet and is sometimes harder to swallow. It may be better off as a new flavor, but not Gourmet Vanilla's replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to be working very well compared to other whey proteins that I've used. I've been able to gain about 2-3 lbs, since switching to this brand of protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very high protein to calorie ratio, tastes ok\n",
      "HORRIBLE- Wish I could get my money back,. The new \"improved\" flavor is the worst tasting protein I have had in 40 yrs plus of drinking protein shakes- which is remarkable being the original before they changed it was the best. From first to worst. \n",
      "Very good product, and goes down easy.\n",
      "It is my favourite now!!! It has good texture and taste. I still add some stevia to my shakes as it is not enough sweet for me, but I have a sweet mouth, so that's why. But it is creamy, even though there are not carb or fats. Perfect post workout supplement. Ask me question on instagram (if you have any): @zorinanataly\n",
      "It's good on price, but worst on flavor than Hydroway.\n",
      "Go ON for hydrolyzed protein.\n",
      "The vanilla flavor is fantastic, good protein supplement.\n",
      "I've tried a few different protein supps and this one is definitely a good one. The almost 0 grams of carbs is perfect for when on a low carb diet plan and taking 3 scoops per day. I've had other powders that with 3 scoops would have added an additional 21 grams of carbs...not ideal. I know the protein is good as it's hydrolyzed whey and I've noticed good gains with it. I give the gourmet chocolate a 7 because I've had better tasting chocolate protein powders but with the low carbs and high quality protein I would definitely buy this product again.\n",
      "This is my favorite protein and I've seen solid gains. I take this between 2-3 times a day. Best quality protein for the servings and price.\n",
      "Simply amazing and unbelievably effective. I saw gains when my schedule was all messed up and i didn't lift heavy at the time. Now that I'm back on my routine the strength gains are amazing! Hands down this is the best protein i have ever used and I highly recommend it to everyone no matter what their goals. Also it tastes extremely good and mixes easily in water. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, look no further, this is the Best whey protein on the market.\n",
      "I have tried the Berry flavour in this protein, I found the taste very strong and extremely artificial tasting, It's also a very thick protein. I wouldn't buy this product again.\n",
      "This is an awesome product. Lots of protein, mixes very well and it has a very good taste compared to other brands.\n",
      "I do recommend it!\n",
      "I love everything(mostly) about this product. My kids even steal it to make shakes with. Blends easy, no clumps and only uses single scoops. However, it was pointed out to me that this contains GMO soy. I have contacted the manufacturer and asked to switch it out to coconut oil instead.\n",
      "Clean taste and negligible  residual mix, not to mention  lack of GI issues, allows me to rate this whey protein as pretty freakin' good. Of course cost is a consideration but in this case it seems you get what you pay for.\n",
      "The absolute best tasting protein ive ever had ! Great job !\n",
      "Great product, fast absorbing and mixes well/quickly. Taste is great, best vanilla flavor I'd had so far. \n",
      "Hello everyone!\n",
      "Today received this protein and tried it after training.\n",
      "Amazing unusual taste, not sugary.\n",
      "Even stirred with water and amazingly well-absorbed.\n",
      "I recommend and I will be buying it in the future!\n",
      "Have a nice day athletes!\n",
      "My friend recommended me this product in Chocolate flavor, but I decided to go for the Cookies & Cream flavor. That was a mistake. It has an artificial flavor to it and I haven't found what to mix it with to make it taste better yet.\n",
      "Never found a protein that I could just enjoy mixing with water! Perfect post workout shake! Will continue to use this product!\n",
      "Excellent protein powder ! great flavor ! mixed very good with liquid ( water , juice , milk , etc.) Highly recommened !.\n",
      "\n",
      "best protein!! very rich flavor!!!\n",
      "I'm completely new to protine powders and only tried a couple of samples. But so far really impressed with this one. It tastes lovely with just water and ice blended up. The zero fat was the main reason I chose this powder. \n",
      "Love This!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The best Post-Workout Protein drink I have tried, I've been using it after every training session for nearly 2 years and will not use anything else. Low calorie, non-fat, no carbs and high-protein leaves me feeling refreshed and not bloated. The Vanilla tastes great too, mixes well with just water.\n",
      "I am in love with this protein. My husband is an avid user of Syntha-6, which is pretty awesome in its own right. This protein blows Syntha-6 and all other whey proteins I've tried out of the water (including Body Fortress, which is crap; and the Optimum brand.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's just start with how well it mixes. I think it dissolved in 2 shakes. There were no clumps, and it doesn't really settle at the bottom of the shaker like most proteins do after being ignored for a few minutes, which always results in my last sip being a gross surprise that I have to chase with water.\n",
      "\n",
      "It tastes amazing too. Like not just ok or good, but like freaking awesome. It tastes like a latte when you mix it with coffee and water (which is good because I avoid milk).\n",
      "This protein shake is amazing. Its doing its job. The scoops in the 5 pounds to the price ratio is incredible. the taste is Delicious. Mixes in less than ten seconds in water and in milk it takes about 10. Its great overall. Highly recommended. \n",
      "I  using this stuff right,\n",
      "JUST FLAT OUT GREAT. FAST ABSORBING TASTE GOOD AND MIXES WELL. \n",
      "\n",
      "A LITTLE PRICY BUT GREAT. WILL GET AGAIN AND AGAIN. LOW CALORIE AND NO CARBS. IF YOU'RE CUTTING AND WOULD LIKE A GREAT POST WORKOUT PROTEIN, THIS IS IT !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have been using this for quite a while immediately post workout and it is probably one of the best proteins out on the market. Mixability is awesome and chcocolate taste is awesome. Cookies and cream was just ok and got real foamy when i shook it up. Very good stuff!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had a lot of different protein supplments to help with my gains, and to help with muscle gains and this by far is the best I have ever had.  I have started noticing differences after a couple of weeks and it is very good in just water most of them are not and this one blows the others away.\n",
      "This is the fastest whey protein I've ever had. It doesn't give me a bloating stomach like some others. The serving size is very small so I don't feel like I just drank a gallon of milk! although I add a full scoop of simple carbs to it to a better recovery. Just a half hour later and I can have my dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is not the best I've tried, but it's very good.\n",
      "Great protein!! Lost 30 pounds of fat, and im almost ripped with abs showing thanks to a good diet and this great tasting protein.\n",
      "Great source of Whet Protein !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have used this product for 2 months now and it tastes great! I shake it in the shaker for not even 15 seconds and it's all mixed and ready to drink! The only think that would make it better is if it had 0 grams of carbs for the gourmet chocolate, but even with 1 gram, it's PERFECT. \n",
      "taste good mix well over all great product!!\n",
      "For first time i decide to use some supplements. My choice is Dymatize ISO-100 vanilla. Use it like a diet supplement. Taste is so good. I use it after gym or basketball so i can recovery my muscles. It really 'works', recovery time is shorter, i do not feel hungry. Also i do not feel any negative consequences. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "mixes well, taste is good but very mild. if you don't like a lot of flavor this is for you. it's a good protein with a good profile. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looooove this protien powder, I wanted something with very low carbs, no sugar, and low fat. This is perfect! It blends beautifully, and satisfies any cravings I might have. It's a little pricy but for a high quality powder like this I don't mind paying an extra 8-10 dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great protein. Its extremely pure and lean. Add milk and a carb source an its great for bulking. Drink it with water and its great for cutting. It taste good and it doesnt leave your gut feeling bogged down afterward. \n",
      "love this stuff, only protein i buy.\n",
      "Tastes good for a cookies and cream variety. I use it with water and like it. Cookies settle at the bottom, but still really good change.\n",
      "The powder mixes easily in shaker and taste's amazing. Great value, great product. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies and Cream tastes amazing with milk. It even tastes good with water which surprised me because most proteins I've had taste horrible with water. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great flavor, results in 3 weeks, the best of the protein in market\n",
      "\n",
      "Started taking this because it was on sale at Hi-Health, excellent product. I saw some nice lean gains with it, but I am also taking a few other supplements for the first time ever so I'm sure it all helped. Flavor is awesome, only thing is there is a lot of spoam when you shake it in the shaker cup or even blender. \n",
      "\n",
      "An excellent post workout protein.\n",
      "100% whey and NO CARBS! Not to mention that it takes amazing! really can't go wrong.\n",
      "This hydro whey is the greatest. The banana cream tastes amazing and makes me feel instantly refreshed after a workout. Dissolves very easily in water or milk and mixes great with oats. Dymatize scored with this one!\n",
      "mixes well, taste is pretty descent and goes down smooth, didnt help too much with recovery, but was a good filler for a snack or meal replacer but no bloating which was nice\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Delicious flavor and mix very easy in water.\n",
      "Vanilla taste like ***....chocolate by far the best..I look forward to it everyday. \n",

      "\n",
      "Horrible taste in a exelent product.\n",
      "So far it's pretty much on point! Taste is good and feels nice on my stomach. No complaints thus far. I think this one is a keeper. Not as tasty as Protowhey but it has less carbs and calories per gram so I guess that's acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "absolute best protein i have ever spent my money on!! a little pricey for my liking but well worth the money. has lasted me 2 full months and i still have some left! tastes great, mixes great, and have seen noticeable gains since i started taking it. lightyears ahead of any protein i know of.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best hydrolyzed protein.I was very fond of chocolate before taking gourmet chocolate flavor.Now I have given up taking chocolates.The taste is the best one of all the flavors available in bodybuilding.com.But gourmet pinacolada sucks,but its rating is high.Be careful.\n",

      "Iso-100 is awesome! Not all protein powders are created equal and Iso-100 stuff blows the doors off of whey protein concentrate. I take two scoops of Iso-100 with 60 grams of dextrose within 30 minutes after I'm done lifting. Taste seems fine to me, although I don't linger with my protein shake post workout, rather I slam it quickly to get it in my system immediately, so taste has never really been a consideration for me with supps. Recovery is excellent and my body seems to react to Iso-100 fairly quickly in terms of uptake. Although I think very highly of Dymatize's Elite Whey Protein isolate, now that I've tried Iso-100 I think it will be my primary pre/post workout whey protein powder. If you've been lifting for awhile and are at all hesitant about purchasing Iso-100 wondering if you'll feel/see a noticeable difference, I recommend that you buy a 5lb bottle and work through it. Definitely worth the extra money for Iso-100 hydrowhey, especially if you lifting hard and putting in serious work!\n",
      "never tasted protein that was this good! I feel like I have gotten stronger even though I operate at a calorie deficiency every single day and I believe this is why. not only that but I feel like I am indulging when I drink it with milk! can't wait to try more flavors\n",
      "Ive been trying out different proteins (this is the third try) Is quite good but a bit too sweet for my liking. I love my chocolate and prefer Isopure Zero in Low Carb Dutch Chocolate, but hey thats my taste. I think price is quite good and mixes very well with water and is good tasting. Going to try a new protein powder after this one is done.\n",
      "Delicious, Dissolves well. Most chocolates i have to add cinnamon to if I'm mixing w/ water. But this one tastes great. No problem dissolving\n",
      "It is the  best Tasting  Low Carb Protein that I have  tried... looking  forward to trying  the other  flavors!!\n",
      "\n",
      "By far the best protein I have ever had, I am 5ft 3in, 109lbs lean muscle, still have an a** and loving this protein, makes me have a better in shape cheer body. Drink this twice a day, One HEAPING scoop per 8oz of water, after I take my Amino 1 Amino Acids and liquid Carnetine for lean muscle. \n",
      "The flavor taste like chocolate milk without the thickness of the milk. Keeps ne full after my workout. \n",
      "I started using Syntha-6 and notices some gains. I decided to switch to ISO 100 and wasnt sure about it. This stuff mixes extremely well but you end up with a muchmore watery consistency that with Syntha-6. My muscles, however, did feel much more solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cookies and Cream has those annoying bits that dont dissolve. I dont think they are real ookie bits. Taste is ok, but those bits are what prompted me to give it an 8 rating.\n",

      "Smooth Banana is as it sounds. Smooth and Banana and tastes great. \n",
      "\n",
      "This supplement has an awesome protein profile, but keep in mind that it should NOT  be used as a meal replacement. You will definitely still find yourself hungry right after taking it. If only they made a 10lb tub.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tastes excellent, and the results are comparable to the taste! Great stuff!\n",
      "So I used to be a huge fan of this stuff, that is until I discovered they use Ion Exchange Hydrolyzed Isolates. I emailed them to find out for sure and when I got a response back they said they couldn't disclose that information. The taste is great, however if you do some research on the processes of Hydrolyzing whey you will see that is the reason it is so much less expensive than say ISOFLEX by allmax nutrition. Do as I did, do some research and put a few more bucks down and buy quality.\n",
      "Amazing taste.  A little sweeter than I'm used to, but it's very chocolatey, and how can you go wrong with that?  Just started using it in my morning protein shake (either before or after my workout), and it's great.  Even my 1st grade daughter is begging for sips.  I take it with Dymatize's Glutamine Micronized and their BCAAs, too.\n",

      "I have took this now for bout a week and I gotta say it is amazing. Mixes well with water an taste good to. Can't believe how hydrolized it is. very impressed. Using to try to drop some weight. Also gonna continue taking MP combat powder for my casein. I'll rate again after a month or so. Hope this review helps ya. \n",

      "ok first of all very good product well its pricy but good protein... the flavor its very good..... and ok this is not part of the review... but bodybuilding.com really well reaalllyyy i just bought this product 10/27/2012 friday and now today its on special you buy 1.6lb iso 100 and they give you a free l carnitine1100 berry freeeeee... reallyyyyyyyy i am extremly angry rigyht nowww thanks bodybuilding thanks....now  my next order will be at GNC :(\n",

      "Mixes very well. Great taste!!\n",
      " Taste is good and good protein/ratio.\n",
      "Stuff rocks! tastes great and has one of the LEANEST profiles on the market. Cookies and cream is my favorite. A little pricey however if you can afford it this is one of the best isolates you can buy. Trusted company.\n",
      "I love this protein, it taste great and no carbs. Just add water and I am good to go!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff tastes great and dissolves quickly. It dissolves in as little as 4 oz of water, so I don't get a bloated stomach when I drink it. My recovery time is really short too when using this protein. Definitely the best I've ever used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein powder is adequate. However, the canister that I ordered was ONLY HALF FULL. Pat bull****. The company that makes this is screwing over their customers. I give the protein powder a 4/10 for the amount that was sent to me. I won't buy it again since it's not worth such a small quantity.\n",
      "the taste is few chocolate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This flavor is horrible. I ordered it because it had a high rating and was looking for something other than chocolate for my wife. Chocolate is fantastic, but pina colada sucks. The overall rating I give will be 5 because the nutrition is still there, but taste will be a 1\n",
      "I tried this product by chance, my cousin recommended it to me, and  Ithink this has easily become my favorite protein, I drink it for breakfast with my kashi cereal, I drink it with my lunch, and I drink it after my workouts, I'm baffled because I actually enjoy this drink. I introduced it to my friend, and he has become a big fan now too.\n",
      "Mixes well. Good, not overpowering flavor. Tastes best in OJ.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my 1st Isolate protein not much difference with my whey protein except that it takes away the bloat . I just ordered a different flavor which is berry . i love body building.com they deliver so fast 1 to 2 business day only for me . Great Product and great Service keep it up!\n",
      "\n",
      "oh and by the way coockies and cream is not bad . but im not ordering that flavor again ..\n",
      "\n",
      "The product is awsome!\n",
      "The flavor isn't good, just the \"cream\" part is ok, but the \"cookies\" are so weird!\n",
      "Greqt taste low carb protien. Does not mix as good as some others.\n",
      "Great taste. Mixes well, no clumps. \n",
      "If you are someone like myself and are very busy and only can mix with a shaker.  This protein shake is bad compared to the ON's product.  Will never buy again...I hope this helped someone make up their mind.\n",
      "It's a little expensive, but I like it. I like the idea of it being a fast absorbing protein, so I only take it right after I lift. The cookies and cream tastes great but is hard to drink fast because the little bits of cookie feels like there is sand in the shake. i'm going to switch flavors. I was only taking this before and after workouts with no other supplements and noticed a difference in mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best protein I have taken. The percentage of protein is over 95% which shows that there are NO fillers. A reviewer stated that the &quot;bottom line was that this stuff is expensive, NBD&quot; I dont think they realize that it takes other brands 2 scoops (and at least twice the calories) to equal the protein in one scoop of ISO-100. If you want low carb and calorie protein, this is the stuff!\n",
      "Bought this item thinking this would be one of the few chocolate flavors that would taste good using water based on the ratings. Wrong!! I immediately could tell it smelled like old-school proteins with that horrible medicinal smell. Sometimes the smell doesn't say it all but unfortunately this one does. It's going to be a difficult 3 lbs to stomach. Maybe the milk users can say otherwise but nothing to write home about when using water.\n",
      "Amazing taste, no bloating or erry feelings. Will always buy this.\n",
      "I am lactose intolerant and constantly on a search for a tolerable tasting lactose-free whey powder. THIS IS THE ONE! It is easy to mix, tastes, great, no carbs, NO LACTOSE. Such a win!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased this about a month ago. I have been using it as my morning shake daily, with a wee bit of creatine added to it. Percentage of protein per weight it is excellent. Taste wise the gourmet berry is probably one of the better fruity flavored proteins I have tried. I am only giving it an overall 9 because it is hard to quantify the results from this product alone as I am taking other protein as my post work out as well. Overall I would highly recommend this.\n",
      "Love the profile on this protein but the flavor is lacking. It smells worse than it tastes. But it makes awesome protein pancakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff is AWESOME! Great flavor mixes very easy with no chunks. Cookies and Cream surprisingly mixes well with every fresh or frozen berry I've tried. Shakes taste AMAZING with this stuff!! Best protein powder I've bought to date...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great protein powder but cookies and cream is an acquired taste. I wish I would have bought a smaller amount to try. I figured since their chocolate is a 10 how could i go wrong. I still recommend product and will continue to use just a different flavor. Also, I don't like the little black flecks in the mix. Just smile in the mirror after you drink one and you will see what I mean. Product mixes very well and is smooth with a good texture. Only reason a less than 10 overall rating is for taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a very good product and the taste is nice\n",
      "yummy flavor, and i feel it works better than taking nothing, def recomend it to everyone looking a good protein without the fillers :0)\n",
      "Excellent protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite protein! Tastes GREAT!! :)\n",
      "This protein tastes so good, each flavor tastes exactly how you would expect them to (in a good way!). This is my protein from now on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes great mixes awesome. one of the best protein drinks I have had yet. Love it!\n",
      "One of the worst protein powders I've ever wasted my money on. It deosn't mix well and it taste like garbage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edited on 4-14-2012: After taking this product for little over a month, I take back everything I said above. Its not the worst tasting, but its certainly an acquired taste. The product is a little pricey for my taste, so I'm not sure if I'll continue with this product. It has certainly helped in a little gains, recovery, and its helped me lean out a bit. My body fat dropped 3% on this product, and thats probably due to how pure the product is because the lack of fillers and fats.\n",
      "out of all the different kinds of protein ive tried this is definitely the best. im in love.ive gained about 20 lbs of muscle and everyone is telling me how they notice how big i got in such a short period of time. it dissolves very easily, u dont need a blender bottle for it. it has 25 grams protein/serving and over 80 servings in the 5lb container. i only tried the vanilla and it tastes good. if u drink it immediately after mixing ull get a tiny chalky strachy taste but if u wait minute its gone. best of all it doesnt have a ton of chemicals and extra stuff ur just gonna **** out. i would recommend this to everyone\n",
      " Great taste!\n",
      "Had high hopes for this product because of its nutritional value. Unfortunately the taste was bad and it started giving me a headache every time I took it. Got halfway through the 3lb container and decided to quit it. Didn't work for me...might work for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing flavor, I actually look forward to taking it. I've been working out without a protein supplement and had problems with recovery (really sore for 2-3 days). I stopped working out for a while and started taking this when I started again with the same workout routine. The intensity of the soreness went down about 50% and duration that it lasted was about 1.5 days.\n",
      "Awesome Product! Mixes well, tastes great and has helped a lot with my contest prep. Will be buying the 5 lb tub after I finish this one.\n",
      "I just tried this for the first time and the taste is awsome! best vanilla i've tried! can't wait to try the other flavors\n",
      "Cookie and Cream is awesome tasting. It has bits of chips like cookies and creame. It is not to sweet as well compare to other similar products from other vendors. Mixes very quickly and well with just water. I recommend this product and flavor for those looking for a great tasting ISP whey protein.\n",
      "Well I cant rate on results just yet because it was just received but WOW... the taste. for having no sugar this is certainly sweet! But anyways, it mixed very well and the scoop size of other proteins used to get me pretty mad but this one is just right. But anyways, after seeing the ingredients and incorporating my workout, i plan to make great gains with this protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this is a great protein but its over priced. I can get it cheaper at my local supplement store. This product recently had a 15.00 increase in price. I will be getting it from House of Fitness In Scottsdale Arizona \n",
      "First off, I went for about 6 - 7 months trying different proteins for personal experimental use. ISO 100 was about my 3rd choice and holy ****. If your seriously on a low carb diet this protien is for you. Great ratio for carbs to fat to protein. This stuff mixed awesome, literally its super fine whey so no matter what you mixit with it dissolves almost instantly. The best part about this protein was taste, its one of the best ive tried. Not the best for huge muscle gain but the best protein for serious athletes on a diet. Well worth every penny.\n",
      "My husband has been using this protein powder for months. I started training for a full marathon and was trying to maintain my muscle mass, so I started using the ISO-100 Gourmet Vanilla. I take it twice a day between meals. It taste great and the powder dissolves well.\n",
      "Really good product. Mixes well and tastes great. Also great if youre trying to not over due on the calories, fat and sugar.\n",
      "Great quality protein  81 scoop for the 5 lbs.\n",
      "Great product and the gourmet chocolate flavor is awesome! \n",
      "\n",
      "Only downside is the price went up twice recently... but still worth it!\n",
      " The only issue i had was the taste, I'll skip the Pina Colada flavor next time, I'll go for the Chocolate flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this protein! No fat, low carb and great taste. Have been using it for a couple of years now. I love my morning oatmeal when I mix half a scoop of the chocolate with half a scoop of the banana and add a little cinnamon. Tastes like a bearclaw donut but without the fat and sugar.\n",
      "As soon as I started drinking ISO 100 after my workout I started to see a difference. I didn't get that workout crash afterward, I started seeing more definition and lose weight!!!! For me that's amazing. And the chocolate flavor is so good I feel like I'm having dessert!\n",
      "Best I have found yet! Low Carb is important to me and there is none better than ISO-100. And the taste is delicious. Mixes very easily. A A A \n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably one of the better proteins on the market. I chose this because it has very low carbs, which makes it an ideal protein for someone who is on a low carb diet.\n",
      "I have taken this for about 2 months now and it is great. The cookies and cream tastes excellent. It is very sweet and great tasting. This powder mixes well in a shaker. I like it because I am trying to trim down and it is low in calories but high in protein. I have taken it every day(post workout), and sometimes for a mid-day snack. I have lost 20 pounds of fat and gained muscle. Extremely happy with this product!\n",
      "A friend of mine told me to use this protein. Man was i surprised, Has good amount of protein and it taste great. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good protein shake\n",
      "\n",
      "Really good and tastes amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is by far the beat protein powder i have ever used. It has the most protein value compared to carbohydrates value if your looking to cut up and bulk. Over the last 2 months i have lost 1 inch in my waist and gained 5 pounds of solid muscle. The chocolate taste is great and it mixes well with no chunks or horrible after taste. I drink a shake for breakfast, after workouts, and at night 1 hour before bed. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Tastes great, and has helped me maintain lean mass during my body transformation. Currently on my 4th week on the product, and i couldn't be happier. I have the cookies & cream, mixes well, and tastes amazing. My only complaint is that cookies & cream has cookie type residue that isn't that great. I am going to order chocolate next time.\n",
      "great protein. doesn't get any better than iso 100. 28 gram serving size 25 grams of protein. this product will get you right.\n",
      "excellent protein, gourmet chocolate flavor is the best !!\n",
      "I love ISO 100 Vanilla. It is low in calories and carbs. You can mix it with anything. I love making protein bars with it. I have tried other proteins but I can't see myself ever changing proteins.\n",
      "work good and taste good\n",
      "amazing i love the flavor i mix it in with my oatmeal n peanut butter in the morning and no clumbs just smooth tastey protein =) thumbs up\n",
      "Low Carb, Low Fat. Mixes well in both water and Milk. Great Taste\n",
      "I LOVE this product, it taste great and mixes very well. I love the vanilla and I am a big chocolate fan, but the vanilla is great, will continues to use..LOVE IT..\n",
      "I have tried plenty of proteins over a span of six years and this by far is the best tasting protein i have ever tried.  It is actually the light in terms of digestion.  it has had a positive effect for my weight loss goals losing about 3 pounds in 10 days.  The only knock on this protein is that it doesnt fill you up well which makes sense since there are no fat/carbs, just add some flax seeds or have a something with fiber. Im actually going to now try pina colada after trying berry.\n",
      "I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this flavor but... wow! Amazing taste (I thinks the best after chocolate). I will definitely buy it again :)\n",
      "I've tried many protein powders in the past year, this is by far the best. Not just taste but the nutrition value as well. With only 1g of carb and 85% protein by weight is incredible. The cookies &amp;amp; cream is good with water and superb with low fat milk. There isnt a better protein. ISO-100&amp;gt;Optimum gold standard whey.\n",
      "I usually use Optimum Nutrition Hydrowhey but ran out and tried Dymatize ISO-100.This is one of the best tasting whey isolates on the market. Ive tried a bunch and for the great nutrient profile, low fat , low carb, Its awesome. I use first thing in the morning and pre-workout. I just mix with water in my magic bullet and it still taste deleicious. I have also tried chocolate and it is very tasty as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Awesome product and bodybuilding.com has the best price on this stuff. Not only a good overall protien it is a protien that you don't have to choke down. It's like heaven in your mouth.\n",
      "LOVE this protein... tastes awesome, and the stats are perfect!\n",
      " Highly recommended.\n",
      "This protein mixes really well. It's kind of hard to go wrong with vanilla but this is still one of my favorite vanilla's.\n",
      " Rating 9/10\n",
      "I've only been on this one week but I'm very impressed so far. The taste is exactly like the name- a tiny bit sweeter than a vanilla bean flavour and nice and creamy- very happy since I was expecting the hydro whey to taste below average. The other thing I like is that you really feel this protein hit your muscles fibers fast, I've never had that feeling from a protein before; really good for after leg workouts. This is purely a post workout shake as I still use Syntha-6 or ON Whey for other times in the day if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "one of the best isolate protein for good price.\n",
      "Graet tasting and easy to mix. A great protien that really works.\n",
      "This is an excellent protien source. Mixes easy and fast. Taste great with non fat milk or water. It will be a mainstay at my house.\n",
      " and grate price too\n",
      "This protein tastes REALLY GOOD!!!! and it mixes very well no joke, once I drank this protein I had a feeling like that it was going to all my muscles in an instant, its just that good feeling when your muscles are like FEED ME after a workout lol really good!!!!.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty good Protein. Doesnt mess up my stomach like some others have. I mix it with water and take it right after I lift. Taste is ok. I plan to continue with this protein for quite some time.\n",
      " Good quality product and special for cutting. Recommend.\n",
      "This is by far the best protein I have ever used! it mixes well and taste great! the only thing I'm not use to is how fast it absorbs I'm use to proteins that fill you up but it's good that this one doesn't.\n",
      "Taste good and 1 carb + 0 fat per scoop ! love it !\n",
      "its excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, and taste so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      " Otherwise the best!!!!\n",
      "I always like to try new protein powders, and this BY FAR is my favorite. Mixes very easy, and tastes fantastic with water. It even smells good dry in the jar. The first time I used it I wanted to make sure it would mix well in water with just a spoon. So easy, and it mixed very well. 24g protein, 1g carb, and only 106 calories...and tastes that good??? This is my new and will be my only protein powder.\n",
      "So far, I have tried this whey and Gold Standard's whey, and I have to say that I prefer Dymatize. It mixes better than Gold, tastes WAY better in water, and I don't have to waste money on buying milk to mix it with. I recommend this whey.\n",
      "The Dymatize ISO-100 Vanilla is the only protein powder that I have found that truly delivers 100% protein. I am a world record holder in powerlifting, having set 12 World records in the Bench press and Deadlift in the past 4 years. I am 60 year old, weigh 146 lbs, and my most recent World record bench press was 380.2 lbs set in June, 2011. These records were set @ official competitions, not just in some gym. I am ranked 38th in the all-time best lifters in the World. I am also a Certified Personal Trainer, completing courses in The Science and practice of Strength Training, Muscle Mechanics, Nutrition, and The Complete Personal Training courses 2009. I have tried many types of protein drinks, and have found most to be difficult to mix, taste terrible, are ineffective, or worse, they are packed with fillers that are of no use to the body and possibly harmful. ISO-100 is pure protein, nothing else, 25grms per serving, mixes easily, taste great, and allows my body to have the protein readily available to provide the protein synthesis necessary for repair and recovery after my workouts. I prefer the Vanilla because the other flavors have small amounts of carbs and I am not looking for carbs in my protein drink. If you want pure protein that mixes easily, tastes great, and delivers, get Dymatize ISO-100 Vanilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BEST hydrowhey!!!\n",
      "My husband and I have both had our fair share of proteins, and this is by far our favorite. It actually tastes very good, even with just water.\n",
      " Taste is bit sweeter for chocolate so I have order Banana flavor this time. Lets see how does that taste :).\n",
      "low cal, zero carb, zero sugar, TASTE GREAT! HEAVEN.. I have it 2-3 times a day..\n",
      "\n",
      "A good supplement , but i dont know whether anybody experienced crunchy creatine like stuff in the end and hint of salty taste in it...\n",
      " BodyBuilding Congratulations for the great service provided!\n",
      "I just ordered this product for the first time. To be honest I don't know how effective the stuff has been so far. I have not been taking it long enough. I haven't finished a 2 lb jug yet. I would like to provide a rating based strickly on the terrible taste of this product. This is easily the worst tasting protein I have ever had. The chocalate flavor is salty tasting. Yes, salty! I have never tasted a salty protein. This stuff is nasty!\n",
      "I have tried many different proteins and this is by far the best I have ever had. I only mix it with skim milk, so not sure how it tastes with water. However, with milk it is delicious. It mixes very well and almost tastes like a milkshake. I actually look forward to having my shake and by the taste I almost feel as if I'm cheating. I HIGHLY recommend this product.\n",
      "Threw two scoops into my shaker with ~14oz water and shook it for no more than 10 seconds. I was pleasently surprised with smooth texture/no clumping along with AMAZING taste. Definitely going to stick to this for a long, long time.\n",
      "Great product, high quality protein. Since its a pure isolate, I use it strictly post-workout with my carbs to help fuel recovery. Berry taste great\n",
      "I love this protein drink it taste great and it is low on calories low carb and no fat. I need to add some meals and this and worked so well I have lost weight and feel great. All women should try this if u don't want to add the calories that other protein drinks have. Love it.\n",
      "It doesn't taste very good. Too sweet. I'd rather choose Smooth Banana.\n",
      " great for cutting\n",
      "I bought this as well as the chocolate. I thought I'd be all about the chocolate, but man, vanilla is super TASTY! Honestly it did take getting used to as it is the first protein powder I've ever taken... but now I happily take it just with water, post work out. It helps me work harder during my training sessions as I know I have a total treat to look forward to afterward! Love that it's so low calorie, yet so beneficial and can easily be fit into my calorie goal for the day.\n",
      "I really like the flavor. Was a bit skeptical because I usually don't like anything with artificial banana flavor, but this one sets the standard. Mixes really well. I reccomend.\n",
      "\n",
      "tastes really good.. sabe delisiosa\n",
      "This was such a great product. Only about 100 calorie, that's lower than most of proteins out there. Also, 0 fat! Isn't that just awesome? In addition to that, lactose had been removed! I am lactose intolerant so this protein was just perfect for me. It also has 25g protein per scoop, which is above average amount. The only downside of this product, you might feel a little bit of bitter taste afterward, but it's not that bad, if u can't stand it (I doubt it), just mix peanut butter or honey or what not. I only tried banana taste so far, I am going to try chocolate next. If you are clean bulking or ripping out, I strongly suggest you this product!\n",
      "Um, wow. This is my new favorite protein. In fact, I now have to go re-rate the other whey isolate is use to use because this one is so much better. Why you ask? 1 - Taste, 2 - Mixability, 3 - LOW SODIUM!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes extremely well. Flavor OK for chocolates. Seems to be more gentle on the GI than others.\n",
      "Great product and best bang for your buck! I have noticed a huge difference in weight and muscle density since starting this protein. Berry doesn't mix as well as the other flavors but tastes really good.\n",
      "This is a great protein powder. Tastes great and does the job!\n",

      "delicious and best of all no carbs/no fat.\n",
      "No bloating!\n",
      "This is one of my favorite protein powders!i dont have to use a blender to mix it and the taste is awesome !\n",
      "Another great tasting product from Dyamtize. I love the chocolate and vanilla Iso 100. The berry is just as delicious. I mix it with the vanilla. Its kinda taste like Nestle Quick Strawberry Milk. Its a nice change from the same old chocolate and vanilla.\n",
      " I recommend this protein to EVERYONE!! Say goodbye to any upset stomach from previous proteins!!\n",
      "This is my hubby's favorite. I am a chocolate girl but He loves the berry. Keeps Him full and energized. One shake in the morning and He's off and running. Never seen Him feeling and looking better. We bought some inexpensive rubbermade shakers and they mix perfectly. Awesome product!\n",
      "Okay, ISO-100 is expensive, and this DOES NOT TASTE LIKE BANANA. I like ISO-100 because it helps me when I want to get cut, but this stuff tastes so bad I can't even get the protein down. It tastes worse than unflavored protein powder. I'm trying to figure out if it tastes like sand or bread crumbs... I suggest trying a different flavor.\n",
      "Mixes great, no clumps. Tastes great without any chemical aftertaste. Very high 86 % of protein per scoop. I wish BB.Com would list the % of protein per serving as a determining factor. Times are tough and I want the best bang for my $.\n",
      "Pretty good taste and mixes perfect. The flavor can get old pretty quick so I wouldnt get the 5lb tub.\n",
      "Outstanding! Blend it with a spoon of PB and you will be in heaven. The cleanest protein I have ever used. My partner loves the Vanilla flavor blended with a scoop of almond butter... or almond milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff is amazing, dissolves cmpletly no gritty texture, smooth like a milkshake, throw some fresh banana in for carbs after workouts, perfect way to get all your protein each day, I blend mine in a bullet but you can shake in container too! I take this 4 times a day to get my additional protein and it has helped me grow dramatically! It's pricey but way worth it, I wouldn't use any other protein, its isolated for fast absorbtion and no side effects, anyone tells you otherwise there lying or didn't buy from body building.com they must not have got the real thing! Chef Out!\n",
      "This product works great. It helps me stay on course by giving me 0 carbs along with all the protein. Since starting taking Dymatize smooth banana, Ive noticed increased strength and less fatigue in my workouts plus Ive lost 22 pounds i will order\n",
      "This is one of the best PWO protein products I have taken thus far. I have used ON 100% whey, Allmax whey&amp;amp;isoflex, dymatize whey, myofusion , and currently ordered XF whey. It mixes easily and tastes great. It is far more cost effective than the ON/Allmax products. I usually took 1 serving post workout with a fruit. Typically with whey products I need to take 1.5-2 serving for optimal recovery but this worked very well with one. Will likely return to this after I have finished evaluating some other notable proteins.\n",
      "Great value for a whey protein isolate. One of the better tasting ones out there.\n",
      "This is my favorite everyday protein powder! I love the taste (chocolate, pina colada, and vanilla = all good). It's an isolate. It blends easily and has zero carbs!\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent. I've had chocolate and vanilla and those are very good but this is my fave. Has a mild blackberries and milk taste and that is using water! High quality 100% hydrolyzed whey.\n",
      " GREAT BANG FOR THE BUCK!\n",
      "Best tasting vanilla protein powder I have tried, and I have tried a lot.  Mixes easily with no lumps.  Results are consistent with other powders, but taste and ease of use make this the best\n",
      "I was initially using a different product, but was really lucky to find this one. It's hydrolyzed, so it dissolves incredibly quick, and I don't get sick or feel 'heavy' int he stomach when drinking it before a workout. It benefits me for many reasons including the fact that it's gluten free. I also love that it has 25g of protein per scoop (not per three scoops!) And the five pound bucket - for that price - yeah - you can't beat this product for protein!\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff tastes awesome and is some of the most high-quality protein i have ever taken.  Easily mixes and i'm currently stacking this with superpump and nov with good results and faster recovery.  I've tried many types of proteins gnc, nitrotech, on100%, eas, musclemilk,elite, etc. This is my favorite protein and should definetly give the chocolate a try.

      "Taste was great but no noticeable results\n",
      "IFBB Michelle LaCost gave me a sample of this at a show, and I decided to pick this up. Wow! What a product. Essential part of my supplement regimen, this is an easy way to get your metabolism working faster, and it tastes fantastic. No need to add more pills and capsules, this is an easy tablespoon (or shot cup) down twice a day and you're done. I needed help staying cut while adding more mass to my figure, and this has been my secret. My girlfriend loves this and swears by it to stay in bikini shape all year round. Like all Dymatize products, this is perfectly priced, tastes great and works like a champ.\n",
      "Great product.\n",
      "I have always taken L-Carnitine caps, but I wanted to change things up. I bought two bottles an orange and a berry. They both taste super amazing and I really feel like I am seeing and feeling better results using the liquid.\n",

      "Hard to know exactly how the product is working, however I have had continuous improvement in my transformation while using this product. Both flavors that I have had have tasted great. My kids think I'm drinking Kool-Aid!\n",
      "Berry is my favourite L-Carnitine out there, have tried Evogen and PrimaForce but none beats Dymatize :)\n",
      "Excellent product easy to drink in the mornings as soon as I wake up. Good flavor to be a liquid. \n",
      "This is very good. Strong berry taste but very good, The powder is always sour when you dissolve it. This is a great liquid l-carnitine.\n",

      "This so far is the best tasting ones on the market & I've tried a few. Worth every dime\n",
      "I love using this Carnitine! First thing in the morning I put a tablespoon of this with lemon juice and 1L of water. Getting my water in, has never been easier. Since servings per day are 2. This automatically gives me 2 litres, easy drinking\n",
      "love the taste! have notice a difference in my BF and starting to see a slight difference in becoming more lean but that could be diet along with the stack! regardless, i will be buying again!!!\n",
      "Great tasting in liquid form.  haven't seen a huge difference but will continue to take.  It takes time but I am hopeful.\n",

      "Great product !! I Like the fact it does not have glycerin in it but have sucralose I am not to crazy about. But taste great. \n",
      "This is a great product. I've used other brands in the past and have not been nearly as satisfied as I  am with Dymatize. Over the past several months I have lost 2% body fat while gaining lean mass. \n",
      "This product tastes great. The berry flavor is so good I could easily take more than I should! Will order again. \n",
      "\n",
      "I like the flavor! i havent taken l carnitine since high school (6 years ago). I haven't noticed a a huge difference at all. I would take a serving first thing in the morning and once in the evening.  I have been following my meal plan to help me lean out but I am still new and haven't noticed any real differences. \n",

      "Taste like syrup ! Very good !\n",
      "\n",
      "Ive tried 3 different L-carnitine liquids and so far this is the best one in taste. The others I pinched my nose and chew something to get rid of the taste but this one is quite good in flavor. I take it in the mornings after breakfast, I know Im supposed to do it before but my stomach tends to not tolerate some things in the morning very well with an empty stomach. But overall is quite good\n",
      "For everyday i take one lid size cup and it tastes amazing, its just an essential to lose weight. Its clear as water and sweet as a lemon-cola.\n",
      "I did notice a drop in body fat percentage.\n",
      "Started noticing a difference in just 3 days... I see great results long term. Very affordable!\n",

      "Tastes good and really works\n",
      "Not bad, but thought it would taste a lot better considering the nutritional values. Not worth the price or calories!\n",
      "Probably my favorite protein bar to date, tastes fantastic and has great texture. 14 grams of sugar is the only problem I have with the bar, its quite high, But its a great bar for a quick pre/post workout fix.\n",
      "an easy way to increase my protein intake, the taste isnt that bad, easy to carry on the go, I recommend this.\n",
      "Perfect product!I will definately buy it again!Boost my energy whyle i was working at the gym for couple hrs!It brings strong mental focus to!\n",
      "The real deal. Best of anything I have tried for rehydrating. \n",
      "\n",
      "This Bcaa is light and foamy when mixed. It has a great taste like Tang.  Very tasty it will keep you fueled and not thirsty after some hard workouts. I was excited about this product because I use to take EAS products in the 1990's and they worked well. I love this Bcaa\n",
      "After a nice run I enjoy drinking this stuff. I do as the directions state 1 scoop with 16 oz of water. The taste is amazing and I feel rejuvenated quickly. I sometimes consume the powder with 16 oz water on a non-workout day for the taste and extra hydration. I had my uncle and father to taste test the product and they both state that this product taste better than Gatorade and PowerAde. I consume this while lifting weights and the stuff helps improve my workout by a good amount as well.\n",
      "Keep up the great work EAS!\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line up front: This stuff tastes amazing! I've used Cellucor and scivation's BCAA's before and EAS has, in my opinion, the best taste of them all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Formula:  Spot on.  Has all the BCAA's needed for the anabolic trigger and for sustained performance.  The small amount of included carbs are just the perfect amount to help flavor and mixability, and give you that extra boost without loads of unnecessary calories.  Oh, and by the way, branch chain amino acids are components of protein, which have calories, so I am personally skeptical when someone says that  branch chains have zero calories.  EAS is totally open and puts their low calorie amount on the label.  Those small calories add up and EAS allows me to count correctly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Performance: Felt a great pump and sustained energy while lifting and doing cardio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor: Seriously, you have to try the orange.  The best BCAA product I've ever had.  Scivation Mango Nectar is a close second, but I'd say EAS wins. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "EAS makes quality products but this particular flavor (Vanilla Cream) was somewhat awful. Listen, I can stomach just about any protein powder, but with the MRPs I like to make a smoothie and casually enjoy it instead of the ol' plug n' chug technique. Regardless, it's probably just the flavor, but I'm not buying this one again.\n",
      "The myoplex is best with crushed ice, one Bannanna, one spoon full of peanut butter, scoop of oatmeal and a handful of pretzels. Great meal replacement 👊!\n",
      "Convenient pre-measured packages are very nice. Taste is great and mix-ability is above average with shaker cup.  Shakes are very fillng and results are exactly as promised. EAS produces very good products that are reliable and do the job. \n",
      "this thing works! good protein meal replacement. been losing lotsa fat and gaining lean muscles within a few weeks. taste great. good stuff\n",
      "I love the convenience of using this powdered product. I can take it hiking, camping, rock climbing, etc. and get the extra protein/energy to continue my activity. I have to drink water anyway so it is easy to add it to my water and shake and drink!\n",
      "this stuff is perfect for meal replacement or pre-workout. Tastes great too. A little thick if you make it per instructions, but can be easily thinned with additional liquid.\n",
      "I love this armour! The taste is fantastic, it's easy to swallow (it's not grainy or powdery) and I don't miss a scoop after my workouts! Will definitely be ordering this again\n",
      "I take it after my workouts or after my hiking adventures, is refreshing supplement. Always ice cold.\n",
      "Love this product. I use with my pre-workout and post-workout. Good pump plus good on recovery. Started using the clinical version Juven years ago. Glad Abbott Labs finally selling in a larger serving.\n",
      "The best of recovery\n",
      "Taste is very good.  Also the 17oz fills you up so great after a workout if you get hungry.  But does not overfill you so using it before the workout can work as well.\n",
      "Favorite go-to protein RTD..Chocolate Fudge and Cookies and Cream always\n",
      "I have been a big fan of the chocolate flavor for a number of years  I tried  the strawberry, buying a single carton when the chocolate was unavailable - loved it too. The problem is when I have bought the 4 or 12-pack of the strawberry since the consistency has been much different. It's very thick (doesn't pour) and it has curds in it. This has been the case on multiple occasions buying from different suppliers and the expiration date wasn't close on any of them. Not sure if the recipe changed or somehow I keep getting bad batches. \n",
      "I find this to be the best quality MRP on the market. I take this when I am at work on days I workout. High quality protein and not too much fat and perfect amount of carbs. The price on the other hand is a bit much. The taste is good but not great. Still you can't beat the quality of protein and carbs.\n",
      "I wouldn't say i'm happy with this product. The taste is awful especially with water :\\ I barely drink it. \n",
      "Who are these people saying this stuff mixes easily? The chocolate flavor was weak. Drinkable is the best i can say. Product does what it's supposed to do. But I'm really wondering why everyone is saying it mixes easily.\n",
      "Product tastes great, even when mixed with water. Mixes very well. \n",
      "I bought this because of the ingredients and it does not taste bad, I loved the cinnamon swirl the mango not so much. I will try the other flavours. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "I couldn't finish this it was so bad. Tasted like a metal froth. \n",
      "I received EBOOST Natural Energy Booster Orange as a free sample with one of my orders. I usually take emergen-c in the mornings but I ran out. So I grabbed this and it tasted awful. Straight chemical taste I barely got it down and as for energy didn’t help in that department either. I really wanted to like this product but I couldn't stand the taste. O, well back to emergen-c.\n",
      "i got this as a sample packet , actually got 2 of them.\n",
      "the flavor is excellent. but i took them on 2 different occasions and both times it made me throw up. so its a hit or miss, i guess but wont use again \n",

      "Good mix. Nice little vitamin pick me up. Placebo? Perhaps. It was free, no complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Got this as a free sample. Orange flavor was alright, tastes like some vitamins I usually take. Didn't mix that well but it really got me up, I had taken some anxiety meds that make me really sleepy and it got me thru 8 hours of work. Might buy it if it's on sale, wouldn't mind getting another free sample. If you live in the US, I'd say get it, it's worth it(I live in Brazil so it's too expensive for me).\n",
      "I tried this product out when i received it as a free sample with my big order. The eboost was really good at delivering its effects. I had an upbeat mood for around 6 hours and felt really good and healthy. The thousands of miligrams of essential vitamins and what-not was nice to see and is something im interested in ordering. The taste isnt so good in water, it would be better to put this in juice or something flavored like xenergy. I recommend everyone try this for free atleast and see how it works for them.\n",
      "The samples were good, but that's not why I bought it, I just wanted a small shaker cup. I probably won't buy the product since I don't need more caffeine, but I love the shaker. Super easy to hold and carry sue to its size, and it mixes well. I aldo think black and blue products are boeing, so i like the fun color. Its my new favorite for the gym. \n",
      "Great mixing cup.  I use it with my amino powders.  I was excited to try the free samples.  Unfortunately, my cup came with no samples.  It's advertised to come with samples, but I received none.  Bummed!  \n",
      "\n",
      "For those who can't live without sweets, this product is a great opportunity to satisfy treir \"sweet needs\". I've tried lemon cheesecake flavor and felt in love with it. The test is very nice, can't wait to bake something with it, because even as a shake it tasets like a piece of a cheesecake! \n",
      "Love this stuff. Helps me sleep, & don't get groggy in the morning and it boosts my metobalism! Will totally be buying again!\n",
      "Excellent sleep product.  I feel it pretty quickly, relaxed and drowsy.  I notice I fall asleep faster and seem to sleep deeper, wake up feeling refreshed.  I've tried a few different sleep products and this one is by far the most effective for me.  I also like the added fat burning effects of the L-Carnitine, and the flavor is a good, and I'm not even a fruit punch fan.\n",
      "This is by far the best BCAA I have tried. I have been through many different brands and flavors but the warrior gummy bear is the best tasting one I have ever had by far. I find myself craving it throughout the day. The product mixes well so I can adjust the flavor just right for me. So the flavoring combined with the solid endurance formula, makes for a great all around product once again by Eflow Nutrition!\n",

      "\n",
      "Love this company, trust them because they show facts and gluta-zorb is very convenient when your on the go!!\n",
      "Excellent product. I've noticed a very nice difference in strength, recovery and endurance after the first couple days.  I can lift heavier and do HIIT at the end of my workouts for 20 to 25 mns and sprint full speed and not be out of breath like I used to. And no muscle soreness. the following day. Truly amazing!\n",

      "Helped me gain mass when supplementing with 2 pills daily\n",
      "I'll admit, I'm kinda a wuss when it comes to creatine powder, as I hate the gritty sandy texture of it. Kre-Alkalyn by Hardcore EFX fits the bill perfectly for me. Never had issued stomach wise with regular creatine, but I do like that this is capsule form and only 2 pills a day (for 175lbs and under). I haven't noticed this to be any better/worse than creatine monohydrate but at 2 pills a day and decently priced, I would recommend to others. \n",
      "the original Kre-Alkalyn it's top !!!\n",
      "creatine it's the best supplement for big muscle !!!\n",
      "hard and heavy everyday !!! Rapha Genetics Coach\n",
      "I did not feel any added benefit from this product that I didn't feel from regular creatine monohydrate.  The capsules were intact and high quality.  There were no flavor problems.  All in all this product was exactly what was expected.\n",
      "The best !!!\n",
      "I've been strictly using Kre-Alkalyn for a few years now and swear by it.  The fact that it is pH buffered helps with absorption.  The fact that it comes in capsule form, helps even more.  There is no issue with bloating, cramping, or indigestion as I've had in the past with other forms of powdered creatine.  I take 2 caps before and 2 caps after lifting for maximum effect, and that dose seems to work pretty well for my goals.  Also, no issues with flavor when purchasing capsules. Overall, a good product I will continue to buy whenever it's on sale. \n",
      "Great product, but I recommend doubling dose to get at least 3gm / serving daily. \n",
      "\n",
      "Been taking this for nearly 1 bottle at this point.  While I have not seen a tremendous increase in strength, at least recovery time is good.  I'll take the product for another bottle and see what happens.\n",
      "Gave the flavor rating a 10, since its a pill and doesn't smell or taste like anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effectiveness of this product however was interesting. The first day I took it, I felt completely wired. I wasn't even able to sleep that night because of how wired I felt. After the first day, I never got that feeling ever again. No boost in energy, nothing. Won't be ordering this again... will try a competitor's creatine the next time around.\n",
      "This is the future of creatine. I don't retain water and I definitely feel the strength all workout long. Even while low carbing for shows, I stay strong til the last rep. I plan on taking this indefinitely. Price is on point too. Can't beat this stuff\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product that truly works. Bottles are pretty cheap for the size. Never really felt bloated or weird, muscles definitely felt fuller after about three days of consecutive use. Would recommend\n",
      "Great.  Easy to take.  Little if any bloating.  Can tell a difference with endurance if I skip before my workouts.\n",
      "This is by far the best creatine I've used. Higher weight and higher reps starting with the very first use. No cycling, no pre-loading, and most importantly: no bloating. Way better than straight mono. \n",
      "\n",
      "It says on the bottle to take 2 before your workout and 2 after your workout. But I get much better results taking all 4 before my workout (typical meathead right?) So if you're not getting the boost you wanted, try that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Horrible product. Literally does nothing. I've used regular creatine mono for a long time and could def feels it's effects on mass building and strength. This stuff you feel nothing at all.\n",
      "I've been using this for years, never have had any side effects. As long as I'm in the gym steady I get some pretty good gains while using it. No cycling needed, no bloating, no stomach issues for me to date. \n",

      "And, it doesn't have a gritty consistency in my workout shake.\n",

      "my favorite creatine product of all time, great pricing and servings. i always see reuslts in strength and size\n",
      "started taking Kre-Alkalyn because my buddy took it and swore by it. I personally feel its a joke. Never noticed any strength or size gains with this product. Recently switched to GAT Creatine and notice a difference within 2 weeks. Not a fan of this product\n",
      "\n",
      "My first time using creatine and it is working very good! No side effects , lifting heavier and for more reps! I'm really happy with this products and I'll continue to buy it for sure. I'll recommand it to all my friends. Thanks Bodybuilding.com\n",

      "The study cited on the bottle says that the subject athletes were given 7.5g of this product per day yet the recommended dose is only 1.5g per day...\n",
      "I add about 2g of this product to my whey shake (50g Muscletech Iso-Whey) upon waking every day, as well as my post workout shake (along with 40g of dextrose). It mixes easily and zero gastric side effects. Along with the Creatine HCL in my pre-w/o (PreJYM), I can max out my creatine intake with minimal product. The strength gains, pump and muscle density are noticeable. Highly recommended.  As with any Creatine product, make sure to drink PLENTY of water. \n",
      "Not a hundred percent sold on this creatine. It just doesnt do it for me like straight Mono does.\n",
      "The first time I used this product I was at a plateau while sparing. After a week of using Kre-Alkalyn EFX I could easily outlast and defeat my opponents. Has helped me with weight lifting, cardio, sparing you name it. This is the only non Beverly International product I use. Phenomenal bang for buck.\n",
      "Great product. If your looking for a creatine that is easy to take with good results this is your product. It has worked great for me through two cycles and the price is very affordable. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before or after a workout, it always works for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have absolutely no complaints about this product. Have yet to see any massive gains but can definitely feel improvement in my overall size and strength. Certainly has helped me to get that summer cut I've been working hard for. \n",
      "\n",
      "Have not experienced any negative side effects whatsoever such as nausea, bloating, or fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good product, would purchase again.  \n",
      "Save your money dudes and get something else. Took it as prescribed with no change in weight gain or strength. \n",
      "Creatine gives me apx. 5% on the bench, and as I compete, every little bit helps. This product has been tried and true for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "this doesn't work for me . A lot of money for nothing .I'm just saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I can't say that I made more gains because of this product. But if your looking to take a creatine that you can feel a little better by avoiding other side effects, then this one is good to try/start out with. I definitely notice difference when I take this product, I stop taking it in between bottles for 2-3 weeks just to do it but they say you don't have to which I don't understand but you can do what you want. \n",
      "I used this product for about 3 months. Didn't really feel any effects and have not used it for about 4 months now and I haven't noticed any changes. Won't be buying again due to its neutral effect. Guess it just didn't work for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this product, as a female I have found that a lot of creatine products bloat me, but this product doesn't, I have seen great results over the past 6 months while using this product. I like because this is stimulant free I can stack it with a pre-workout of choice if I am feeling sluggish or just use it by itself. \n",
      "Great product. Taken before workouts and after muscle gains and energy, a lot of power lifting.\n",
      "I already see some improvement in only 2 weeks!\n",
      "\n",
      "Never taken creatine before but did some research before choosing this one. I can't pinpoint my success thus far solely on this product alone but something is definitely working between this, my 6 meals, 2 whey protein shakes + a casein shake every day! I have been getting serious results and everyone is noticing already and it's only been 4 weeks in! I like the convenience of 1 capsule 30 minutes before and after my workouts. One thing I've noticed is in the beginning especially, I seemed to wake up in the night to urinate multiple times which is unusual for me. This could be result of creatines in general or me being newer to the diet of 1+ gallons of water a day. My body seems to be adjusting back to normal now that it's getting used to this additional supplement. So far I can't complain, and have only gotten gains!\n",
      "I love this stuff.  After taking it for a while, I've noticed some quick gains in the amount of weight that I can lift!  I've noticed no side effects thus far.  I have been using it for nearly two months.\n",
      "First time I took 2 pills 30 minutes before workout. Made my armpits sweat before I even got off the subway into the gym which was weird. Threw on a weight I knew I could bench for 4-5 reps, and busted out 7. Yes, the strength gain was that dramatic. Over dozens of types of supplements over 25 years of lifting, the only times in my life I've ever felt that type of power boost were 1991, taking 2 Ephedrine HCL tabs with a cup of coffee, and 1994 when I first started taking creatine powder. This is my new go-to. Only downside would be, although strength went up, I noticed my stamina seemed to have gone down - by my 5th set I was pretty fatigued when normally I could go 7 or 8 sets.\n",
      "This is by far the best creatine supplement I have taken.  I would recommend this product to everyone. \n",
      "Seems to work as well as fusion purple k at half the cost.  I seem to respond well to kre- alkalyn so I love it.   Instant strength and rep gain\n",
      "I have been taking Kre-Alkalyn EFX for about two months, and I am so glad that I discovered this supplement for myself. My working weights have gone up, I gained some lean muscle mass, and I feel that it's easier for me to push myself in the gym. I feel stronger! That's why Kre-Alkalyn EFX is definitely my key supplement.\n",
      "A++ THE BEST!!!!\n",
      "This product is awesome! I recently have added it to my pre-workout stack and have found it to be very beneficial. I've noticed increased strength and a delay in fatigue during workouts. Will definitely be using Kre-Alkalyn over Creatine Monohydrate from now on.\n",
      "Great creatine...added half scoop with my pre workout and half scoop with my shake afterwards and gotta say love it gave me great strength increase and recovery fuller muscles...no bloating good\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a good creatine supplement its in pill for and you only have to take 2 (If above 175) and one if under which is better than other pill supplements whereu have to take up to 8 pills for a serving \n",
      "Great product! (:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been taking this for about a month now (2 capsules pre workout and 2 post workout and 2 on off/cardio days) and I like the pump it gives me during workouts and the convenient way you can get your creatine. I also like how you don't have to load on this creatine. \n",
      "works great, can mix it with anything and  not get all that sugar like other powders.\n",
      "I got this product to increase my strength on the bench.  It is very safe and best of all... No cycling necessary.  I had no negative side affects and my workouts were consistent.  They also make it in pill form which I also suggest.  Dosing is simple and can be combined with any stack.   \n",
      "Awesome product! I didnt think a small dose like this would work at first. But after about 2 days of taking this product the pumps were exciting to say the least. PH in the body can be very tricky but All American has done a good job here buffering this creatine formula where it works well for me. All i really need is some good energy, strength, great blood flow, and this product has just that! Thanks All American, keep up the good work!\n",
      "D Kaz\n",
      "This is my favorite creatin:D is the best, at my workout at half sqad I have 140 kg, but after 1 month of ussing this creatine I arrived at 200 kg at half squad:D\n",
      "I really enjoyed the fact that I Did not have to load, the capsules are easy to swallow.\n",
      "I live this stuff. It has giving the best results with no bloating. All American nailed it.\n",
      "Great product! I've taken many forms of creatine and this one really works for me.. I love the muscle hardness and fullness I get from taking this creatine.. Strength is up.. I'm not knockin any other form of creatine but this one is a definite go!! Try it! \n",
      "\n",
      "This product at first gave me a surge of strength.  I took it only for a week when i began to notice different strength gains.  I took it for a month and noticed no difference in size whatsoever.  The strength gains i had in the first week continued to stay the same for the rest of the month.  An ****ght product, but there is definitely better that you could have.  \n",
      "Recently began using this product, then read the reviews and noticed concern regarding Prop 65 warning on this product.  In researching this, found out it is not on all of the bottles in my area.  Because there is a discrepancy in the amount of lead legally allowed by the FDA, Pharmaceutical Companies , and Prop 65,  All American put this label on during their testing period. It meets the highest restriction (lowest in lead), so the warning is removed.  This is my first experience using a kre-alkylyn product, and I am liking the additional strength and endurance.\n",
      "I do not get the bloated water feeling that I would get with creatine. Helps with lean solid muscle build.\n",
      "neutral about it. I took two capsules a day before working out and 2 on off days. for one complete bottle.  I don't feel my lifts improved any but it may have helped.  I don't think it hurt either.  Positive is don't look bloated or gain any unnecessary water weight. I'd prob buy it again only cost 13 bucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Been taking this for years. I can tell it works because when I get off I notice this difference. It may just be water weight, but I lose size. Minimal if no bloating. Great product. Although, the Prop 65 label does give me some worry.\n",
      "I have noticed a lot of bigger gains in the gym since I started taking this back in July. As with all EFX products I believe they are the next level up compared to other supplements.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't trust that it will work, but it yielded good result, there is a feeling that I accepted a big dose arginine, muscles are inflated, force is increased. excellent product\n",
      "This is by far the most effective creatine I've ever used. I gained serious permanent mass, and I really felt the difference in recovery time and strength.\n",
      "Pills aren't made for having a flavor so, if you're getting this product, looking for flavor, this isn't it... but it works awesomely!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      " I am back on since around Oct. 10th 2012 and take about 6 grams a day total, this stuff is great &quot;for me&quot; I can see a difference in less than a week. I tried many different creatine products before finding out about All American EFX Kre-Alkalyn, and all I can say this stuff rocks!! for me personally. I know we all have different body chemistry's, so you may not get the same results, but I am totally satisfied.\n",
      "I have used mono creatine in the past and switched to kre alkalyn because the mono made me retain water. Mission accomplished, no bloating with EFX and it's nice with no loading phase. I noticed some decent gains and a nice pump but nothing spectacular. Thinking about trying Con-Cret when this bottle is gone.\n",
      "veryyyyy goooood!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " doesn't work at all, and contains heavy metals! I have used half 60 caps bottle and ordered another bottle, just to keep trying (I had to take many caps at once to get some effect, so, the bottle was going really fast). The problem is: in the old presentation of the bottle, there was no advise about heavy metals. I just knew that when I received the bottle with new packaging (that I put in trash at same moment; lost $$$). Also disappointed with BB.COM, because they used to say (not all) which products contain lead etc, with an advertise under the label posted in the site. Now, i've checked these products and BB took off advertisements that were already there, in place of update all products in that unhealthy condition... I like BB, but I would like that you keep that in mind. And about Kre-alkalyn and All American EFX: ZERO!\n",
      "\n",
      "Best Creatine period. If you think it doesn't work do more research. It is just buffered mono meaning all the benefits of mono but better. Mono does not work for me this does thats all I need to know. I get reat strength gains on this and it is not expensive at all.\n",
      "I have seen great gains while using this product. My strength has increased dramitcally and I have put on about 10 lbs in 2 and a half months (with little water retention). You do get a very good pump from this product. It is fairly cheap, but their dosage (if over 200 lbs) makes it pretty expensive seeing as you have to take 6 pills a day (when working out). I only take 2 before and 2 after I work out and it works perfectly fine for me. I would recommend this product to anyone, in fact I already have to my one friend from school and he loves it.\n",
      "Love the product have been taking it for a while now. I have been gaining muscle and it is not too hard to take either\n",
      "it works good for me. i sometimes take 2 or 3 of them before workout if i wanted to feel pumped\n",
      "Hands Down !! Good Price &amp;amp; Good results .. Love it\n",
      "Good product gives a great pump. But a Side effect is it makes my stomach hurt I don't know why. Other than that great product.\n",
      "\n",
      "This product totally destroys all creatine monohydrate. most definitely better than any other form of creatine i have tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best kre-alkalyn I have found thus far.\n",
      "Started taking this product after 1 month leave from the gym and what a difference it made. Strength went through the roof put on 4 pounds in 2 weeks. No water retention, been losing fat and such small doses, all around excellent product.\n",
      "right before i found kre-alkalyn i had just about given up on creatine. over the years i roughed through a few months of on and off trial and error with numerous creatine types and brands, my muscles seem to respond well to the intake, but my stomach wasn't having any of it! then i tried this no-loading, buffered creatine and not only did it work just like the other creatine product i tried, but it worked better on a much lower dosage and my stomach handles it beautifully!\n",
      "Making gains on this. Taking once before and after workouts. I am also eating 6-8 meals a day which is helping.\n",
      "At first I was not sure about trying a different type of creatine, due to the bad past experiences most people have undergone like bloating and water weight to name a few, but in the end this stuff worked out great. Every time I finish my workouts my muscles feel pumped and rock hard whereas the other creatines made them feel a little squishy. And within 2 months or so I have seen results in size and definition. This product is awesome and will buy again. Keep up the good work All American EFX...\n",
      "First of all ive used many different kinds of creatine. from plain monohydrate to creatine ethyl-ester (like cellmass). Both of those work but i also got some side effects. it always left me bloated and i always felt like i was retaining water in the wrong places while i was on them. i switched to this stuff from bsn cellmass and i will never go back. I never retain water anymore and i can feel it working when i am able to get great pumps and my muscles feel &quot;fuller&quot; all the time. The convenience of the pills are awesome and my stomach doesnt get upset anymore. While i was on this i was able to maintain my strength during a cut and actually go up on some lifts. 10/10\n",
      "No cycling needed.\n",
      "This is a great creatine product with a great price. I have tried a lot of different creatine porducts and when the bottle is gone i am always looking for a new one. This is the first product i am going to buy again. Love it .. Great strength gains and zero bloating.\n",
      "Ok so the kre alkalyn works very well its my 2nd or 3rd time on it not sure. It increases strength definately and you can see your muscles get more dense and big. Its not a miralce drug or anything but after about one week you see the difference in strength. I will also say that although it says no water retention you still do get some but not as bad as creatine also it doesn't fludh right through you like creatine. I take aboe the recomended does to shock my system on some work out days so I will take 4 pills instead of 2. Musch better than regular creatine and much better results all around. I really loe this stuff and to me its really cheap, I stack with anodrox and endothil cr also, but the kre alkalyn alone is worth it. I take it before and after my workouts. Ryan\n",
      "I've noticed increased strength without the bloat in a very short period of time.  The best thing is that I only have to take two capsules a day, as opposed to the 10 capsules with my old creatine supplement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Product is not all that it's hyped to be. It' taste very much like egg it's clumpy hard to pour out to messy pump sucks n clogs it's extremely expensive and protein per serving is low def not a 9+ it's a decent product but a more traditional product is way more bang for your buck not as messy and way better tasting. And it gives u gas like crazy\n",
      "Absolutely LOVE the product. Very easy to use and the fact that I can wake up throw a scoop of  protein, and a cup of oats in my egg whites and have already gotten 50 grams of protein and 20 grams of carbs between food and powder is awesome. I will continue to use this product and have already mentioned it to numerous people. Like I said I love the product and the service to this point has been among the best I have ever encountered. Highly recommend!\n",
      "100% satisfied with this product. \n",
      "Their customer service is unparalleled. \n",
      "Lifetime customer.\n",
      "This  is an amazing product! I've been using international egg whites for several years and it was always been my go to product.\n",
      "I absolutely love this product! I have been using it every day for well over a year and a half! It saves me so much time from cracking eggs and separating them on a daily basis. I am a mother of three and a full time employee, there is nothing better than grabbing my protein shake, putting three pumps in and go on my way! \n",
      "LOVE these and these are a staple in my daily diet. its so much easier to get the egg whites than it is to use full-shelled eggs (if you eat  a lot of whiteS)...every once in a while there is a weird gooey portion that forms a ball inside the container but i just don't eat that part. lol. i buy from this company every time.\n",
      "I DRINK this product everyday. I absolutely love this stuff, Makes my life a whole lot easier!\n",
      "I happened upon Egg Whites International while at the 2014 Olympia and decided to put in an order and give it a go. I absolutely LOVE this product. I prefer using this to the egg whites in the store since these can be safely consumed as-is. They make the FLUFFIEST omelets (takes a little longer to cook than raw egg whites - it helps if you add one raw egg into the mixture). I, personally, do not drink this by itself, but instead use a pump or two to give a \"protein boost\" to my smoothies, yogurts, etc. Mixes easily with pretty much anything without altering the flavor. Fantastic product.\n",
      "I love this product!  It shows up frozen and the quality it superb.  It really makes life so much easier to use this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product, the 4 gallons came frozen which was perfect. three of them went in the freezer and used the first one. \n",
      "They work well for baking, just regular cooking (scrambled eggs etc.) and mixing into shakes. Expect the shakes to be a bit thicker. \n",
      "Additionally, I have a 2 yr old son who gets picky about what he eats from time to time, I put a pump into his milk to supplement his protein, he cant tell its there.\n",
      "What can I say I was a little skeptic of buying this product but the hassle of working Law Enforcement I was looking for something I can fit into my diet on the go. I take a cup of egg whites with protein and creatine in the morning and I can honestly say it feels me up until my next meal. It has no eggy taste and is perfect for anyone who is on the go or doesn't have time to cook in the morning. I love this product and will be buying more in the future. Federal Law Enforcement Officer Mariscal.\n",
      "This fulfills all the purposes I need it for and does what is needed. Just bought 2 gallons after trying 2 half gallons.\n",
      "The liquid egg whites by Egg Whites International are a superior product.  I order the 2-1 Gallon case regularly since first trying the product back in July 2014.  When the egg whites are shipped from the originating company in California, they are initially frozen in an insulated box, by the time they arrive to my home in Florida they begin to thaw and NO issues in the egg whites upon receipt.  The product has no odor, tasteless and literally can be added to anything - I put them in my post-workout protein powder drink, I use them in the morning to cook scrambled eggs and they are literally amazing in taste.  By far this is the most superior product, I have purchased egg whites from various suppliers in the past but none come close to the quality of this product.  If you're looking for something to boost your protein intake then do not hesitate to consider this product as since I've started using these egg whites every day my lean muscle mass has improved dramatically.  \n",
      "I've been using this product for the past 4 years or more and it has truly helped me to put on more muscle. My 1st bodybuilding competition in 2012, I weighed in at 174.5. I took 3 years off to build muscle and this product was instrumental in helping me to add on about 20 lbs of lean muscle. I use it in conjunction with my protein powder in order to increase bioavailability of the protein into my muscle. I've also used it in recipes or just when I want cooked egg whites. However, do to the odorless and tasteless nature of the product, I usually use a cup of it and blend in a scoop of protein powder along with a couple ounces of almond milk and it makes the best protein shake their is. I order a 4 gallon case every couple of months.\n",
      "EWI is a great company to buy from and their product tastes excellent and is completely safe. Their customer service is top notch and so is their packaging. They keep you up to date with your order and quick to answer any questions you may have. If you use a lot of egg whites for breakfast or for any meal, this would be the route for you. You can easily make scrambled eggs or an omelet. Or mix the egg white in with your protein drink for extra protein throughout the day.\n",
      "Great product. It has no taste, which is a plus. It mixes well with protein powders and doesn't foam up. I even make omelets with it. Once it thawed out though, I had to run it through a strainer. It had chunks of egg white goo floating on top. \n",
      "Let me for one say I HATE EGGS! So for me the thought of drinking my eggs made me wanna throw up. However this product had such a good rating and not to mention they are ODORLESS AND TASTELESS  they weren't kidding.  Upon arrival I cringed my nose expecting the worst.  I first tried smelling them to prep for the taste....and nothing.  I decided to go ahead and pour me half a glass and give it a shot.  I added a bit of water so mentally i wasn't drinking straight egg. First sip no taste whatsoever.  I felt like i was drinking water,  so I ch****ed 4oz and it felt great. I cant tell u how pleased I am. I can get a sufficient amount of protein without gagging it down. I love this product and happy i took a chance. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! \n",
      "I was initially hesitant to try these liquid egg whites but I'm glad I took the plunge. Not gross, no smell, no slime, period. I use it in my shakes which are a mix of hydrolyzed whey and casein and it's fantastic. I should think it would mix with basically anything. It has a salty taste (but not at all overwhelming) and a yellowish tint and those are the only signs you're consuming egg whites. In just the few weeks I have consumed this product I have already seen my body changing. Product came quickly and still well frozen. Took several days to thaw completely in the fridge. Customer service is great and they actually encourage you to contact them, which is rare. Take a chance and try something new!\n",
      "When I began training for my first bodybuilding competition I was purchasing egg whites from the supermarket in huge quantities! Carrying what seemed like 15 cartons of egg whites was not only annoying, but when I actually started incorporating them into my meals the taste seemed to overwhelm whatever meal they were in. I heard about Egg Whites Int. from a fellow bodybuilder and decided to try them out. Not only could I purchase egg whites in bulk for a reasonable price, but the egg whites themselves are practically flavorless!! I quickly started using them to thicken up everything or add a splash of protein where I needed it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommend Egg Whites Int.!!!\n",
      "Great Protein. Blends wells because is taste less. Easy to cook with.\n",
      "Everything about this product is a 10 by far!!!!  \n",
      "\n",
      "I only took a way 1 star due to the fact they are located in California and shipping for me in MA takes like 8-10 days... WORTH THE WAIT! :) \n",
      "\n",
      "Easily one of the best products I have used in my 10 years working/being in the industry.\n",
      "Great product and very clean!  While training for competition I consume nearly 2 gallons a week in the last month.  Shipping is easy, safe and always comes packed frozen.  The ONLY downfall is the cost of shipping and the distance from CA to WI takes all week.  Oh well, I just order early and often!   \n",
      "Amazing, fast, fantastic, healthy, flavorless, not a gross texture, all around best money I've ever spent on food and what an amazing form of delivery with the dried ice and all!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my second order of this stuff.  I started off with the half gallons because I wasn't sure.  I really like it.  I am lactose intolerant so this works great for me.  It is not completely tasteless on its own.  It has a slightly salty taste.  Mixed with 100% orange juice you cant even tell.  I also works well with odwella 100% juice.  I have tried with other fruit and vegetable, but these two seem to blend  with it better.  I have put it into almond milk and it didn't blend as well and you could taste the saltiness.  It was kind of gross.  It is not as slimy or thick as regular egg whites.  For texture eaters like me,  this works well blended into something.  I have not tried cooking with them yet as I am not a big egg eater (I don't like the taste or texture  of eggs).   I drink with 5 pumps and orange juice in the morning; 5 pumps with orange juice after a workout; and 5 pumps in the evening; instead of doing the recommended 8 pumps in the mornings and 8 pumps in the evening.   It has worked exceptionally well for me using this way.  I seem to have faster and more visible results without the bloating I use to get with whey.  No matter what else I eat throughout the day, this has become a staple part of my regimen. I will definitely be ordering from now on.  \n",
      "This product mixes with anything! It is more getting over the mental aspect of knowing you are drinking egg whites! :) - but mixed with milk, or OJ.. etc-- you really can't tell. I have mixed it with oatmeal, and my normal morning smoothies too. I rate it a 10 for no taste, great consistency, and ease of use.\n",
      "great for cooking.  \n",
      "Ok so I got this product because I wanted to be able to get a quick shake in the morning. Well the shipping on this took a week after it had been sent (nowhere near as awesome as bodybuilding.com) and I was skeptical about the product being ok to drink. It ended up being ok, but then it's salty and doesn't mix well with anything...maybe it's mental. Either way, I can only use the stuff if I cook it and since the majority of the eggs I end up eating are boiled I have to go through that fun process of trying to use this up and taking the time to get the **** out to boil it. Meh overall. \n",
      "Always good. My fave!! I even use sometimes in the blender instead of skim milk to make my shakes.\n",
      "Quick and easy.  Theres no taste but there is a slimy texture and a little after taste.  I have to chase it with something if i drink it solon.  If its in a shake I don't even notice its there.\n",
      "I put it in my drinks and cook with it! \n",
      "i never seem to be able to get enough protein in a day! I now mix liquid eggs in both of my protein shakes, one for breakfast and my one before bed. You would never know there were eggs in these shakes...truly tasteless! I am so glad i decided to try this product and will continue to use it throughout my fitness journey!\n",
      "\n",
      " Fortunately, there is a solution to the gas problem: Take broad spectrum digestive enzymes before taking this product, and gas will be minimized considerably. Believe me, this is almost a must.\n",
      "No joke...this stuff is great. the taste is great and they make really good egg white omelets. don't forget to order the pump tho. I wouldn't know how to measure the serving size without it, maybe a measuring cup, i don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been keeping my eye on this product for 2 years now afraid that it would not live up to the hype i've have been reading about. I have just received my first order of 2 half gallons (6/27/2012) and now i'm kicking myself for not ordering 4-1 gallon containers. This stuff is great I should have tried sooner. Taste great. I mix with all my protein shakes instead of water or milk. now i really can't wait until my next meal. I'll be making a protein fruit smoothie. Thanks EWI !!!\n",

      "Sooo conveniant ! I drink 10eggs whites every night before bed. \n",
      "This is a great product especially if you have a huge need to get a lot of protein. Makes it way easier to get protein in as a bigger guy getting ready to diet down. I was worried with my first order with the item being so perishable but the packaging was above and beyond top notch. Opened up the box and it was still ice cold in the box with the egg whites still mostly frozen! Using these egg whites in shakes makes a super creamy shake and easy to down when your in a hurry and have a tight schedule like most people do! I suggest getting the pump to... It works great and makes measuring the protein amounts VERY easy. Great all around experience with this product so far and getting ready to order MUCH MUCH more.\n",
      "These egg whites are good. There is no taste to the liquid what so ever while you still get 100% of that egg white protein. Awesome stuff.\n",
      "WARNING!! This will make your ***** smell like someone died up there and came back to life and died again. Sometime the smell just lingers in the air 30min after the initial launch! Amazing but it does work. Doesn't taste like anything. Only downside for the east coast people is shipping since its coming from a outside vendor not BodyBuilding.com. This thing comes from California and you have to wait about 5 days. Which isn't bad but BodyBuilding.com has me spoiled with there 2 day delivery :(\n",
      "When I first heard of this product I did not believe that there wasn't any taste or smell. After researching this company for awhile and hearing only good things I decided to try them. I truly believe that this is one of the best pure protein products out there. I have mixed it with many things and I am still unable to smell or taste the egg whites them selves. Also they are extremely quick and easy to use. Truly amazing!\n",
      "This is hands down one of the best products I have purchased.\n",
      "Awesome stuff!!  Little pricey but well worth it.\n",
      "Food is important in reaching ur goals...\n",
      "WORTH EVERY PENNY!\n",
      "I definitely am satisfied with this product. I can feel the absorbtion of protein quickly. I'm using this while on summer break. Unfortunately, it takes too long to get this product from manufacturer. Everything I order from bodybuilding is here within a few days, but eggology lags on sending their product. For this reason, I'll be happy to go back to order another product from BB when school starts.\n",
      "\n",
      "***WARNING*** Now that I have your attention, I'll start by letting you know that I only used this product one day, so my review is ongoing, but I can tell you that I've tried numerous products over the years, including all the big name ones. With most products, I feel nothing, unless they're filled with tons of caffeine, then I get the normal caffeine jitters. This product is unlike any product I've ever used before (the reason for this review), this is definitely not a placebo with a fancy label, something happened to my body, and only time will tell if it's good or bad. I highly recommend that you don't take this, for the first time, on a day when you have anything planned, because if your body reacts like mine, you'll find yourself making numerous trips to the rest room. By the end of the day, I just felt full and fat, and the thought of food was the furthest from my mind. Now, more than 24 hours after taking the first dose, and about 10 since the last dose, I still feel full and fat. I think I'm hungry, but I can't imagine eating while feeling so fat and stuffed. All day yesterday, I felt parts of my body moving that I almost never experience. I really can't say for sure if this product is great yet, but it's definitely doing something, and I'd rather spend money for something, than spend it on nothing. I'll try and update this review later, if I'm allowed to edit, or maybe I'll submit another review if I can't edit this one. At this point, I have nothing but high expectations following my \"first impression\" of this product. It was a rough first day, but I think once my body gets used to it, the negative effects will diminish, and I'll be able to enjoy only the positive effects.\n",
      " I bought this product to increase my metabolism on days that I do not work out. Turns out..it is great for everyday! I take two in the morning and two after lunch. It actually stops that mid afternoon snack attack.  \n",
      "I chose this product because of the  lack of stimulants like excessive amounts of caffeine.  It does not make me nervous or jittery. It just seems to wake me up a little and I feel better. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is very expensive creatine for only 1.75 grams per serving.  I think I'll be picking up something cheaper with more creatine next time. However, I did like the fact that there were not any harmful dyes like red-40, which seems to be in almost every other sup out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best product I have tried. Others make me sick but this one gives me the pump I need to get through my workouts.\n",
      "Highly doubt ingredients. 3 scoops-feel nothing.\n",
      "Unfortunately, this product has discontinued! It gives you great focus during your workout\n",
      "This was a great flavored BCAA.  I would use it during my workouts and while just lounging around on my rest days.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Anytime you need to re-hydrate, you should try to reach for a BCAA supp before a sugared sports drink.  Just saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor to me was spot on 10/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixability - 9,5.  I spoon stirred it most of the time, but was better with shaker. \n",
      "Great flavor!\n",
      "Great mix ability!\n",
      "Great price!\n",
      "Overall great brand! \n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent product! I still go back to ERGOgenix because they offer great items at a great price. I use this as preworkout on running days and use it as an intraworkout on lifting days. Also great for a boost in middle of a long day. Has good ratios of Aminos with additional supplements that help in all aspects of your workout. Fantastic product that compares well (and is possibly better) to EVLnutritions BCAA engery.\n",
      "Great product and probably the best value on bb.com.  Both the cherry and bb lemonade taste great great.  Everything you need for some bcaa''s and an extra kick.  \n",
      "\n",
      "flavor is bad\n",
      "I love my blackberry lemonade ErgoAmino+! It is great for a pre-workout or an afternoon pick me up.\n",
      "I gave this a 6 for overall rating just because the price. The flavors aren't great at all. Nothing compared to its preworkout, which is great (Good clean pump and flavor). Both flavors i tried have same terrible aftertaste. I don't know why, but a lot of people say the same flavors i tired taste great or are even a little sweet, which wasn't the same for me. I think Ergogenix needs to work on this, making the flavors more consistent. If the flavors aren't conistent how about the bcaa's and other ingredients?!\n",
      "I like this product and it works well, but taste isn't superior. \n",
      "I love this product. I drink this daily just for the nutrition provided in the array of ingredients. The only thing that would make this better is if there was a non-caffeine version, and if they added CoQ10.\n",
      "I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Became a fan of ErgoGenix just because of this. I mix 2 scoops with 30oz. of water (recommended use would be around 3 or 4 scoops) but even with that amount of water the taste is great, smooth and soft. Some complain about the \"after taste\" but you get used to it and will love it. I look forward to drinking this product during my training. Again, taste is great, energy is great and... OH YEAH, the price is the best. \n",
      "Very good nutrition profile for how cheap it is. Got a BOGO deal on this, so price was much more attractive. Mixability is fair at best and foams up profusely in your shaker cup. Taste is okay, but mixability is where the cheapness of this product really shows through. For the price I'd buy it again. I just replace diet soda/coffee/crystal light with really cheap BCAAs with caffeine. Cost about the same and couldn't be hurting really.\n",
      "Good amount of caffeine and good amount of servings!\n",
      "Stuff tastes pretty good. I take it 30 minutes before my workout and usually stack it with my preworkout and feel like it does boost my energy and help dramatically with my recovery. Even without the preworkout I feel like I have more energy during the workout and have to leave the gym mostly because of time constraints then fatigue. Great product!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this BCAA product!  It mixes pretty well.  The Wildberry Pomegranate is my favorite flavor, the strawberry kiwi has kind of a funny aftertaste, but still not bad. Very impressed - 50 servings for $25 - can't beat it.\n",
      "I bought this for more of a post workout and it actually works well for a pre workout without the jitters and that's why I'm giving it a 9 instead of 10. \n",
      "Flavors were very good. Mixed perfectly in less-than-ice-cold water, too. Really need to take two scoops to get the BCAA benefits, though. Didn't really notice the beta-alanine - no \"tingles\" to speak of.\n",
      "Really good flavor and mixes pretty well.\n",
      "Very sweet, but did the job for me. They are normally a good price as well so I'll be sticking to them for now.\n",
      "Honestly, at first the taste was rough but after a week I got over it. Saw really great results using this product. can't beat it for the price. I would recommend it\n",
      "I bought this when it was on sale for really cheap. I should already know you get what you pay for... I am not a fan at all. The taste is horrible and I really don't notice any recovery help either. I will stick with my amino energy from ON from now on, even if it's more expensive. \n",
      "Flavor is okay, but almost unbearably sweet. Caffeine level decent. Purchased these because of the sale, but I will definitely be sticking to Amino Energy from now on.\n",
      "Really good amino for during your workouts or running. I like mine while running, it helps me keep going! \n",
      "Great to drink during my workouts. It has just a bit of caffeine to keep me going and I have noticed somewhat better recovery time. I plan to stick with these aminos since they are not outrageously priced.\n",
      "Decided to try this brand a friend told me about and I really love the Aminos it feels good during the workouts I like the taste as well too! Deff will buy again!\n",
      "I switched BCAA's because of a sale - big mistake. I ordered 2x50 serving containers of the Blackberry lemonade and I have been drinking it for 3 days now. It takes me a long time to finish it because of the taste and its impossible to chug it. Won't be buying this again.\n",
      "Bought a sample, yep will be buying again. Tastes amazing, light not strong. No stomach issues, and I got a good smooth sustained energy through my workout. This worked very well for me. Amazing unusual different taste strawberry kiwi! New flavor! Its ok. Definitely different!\n",
      "I bought this product because there was a BOGO sale at the time of purchase. Absolutely worst tasting amino supplement I have taken, would not recommend either the pineapple mango or strawberry kiwi flavors.\n",
      "Great flavor as always, plus the caffeine and other useful amino, you can definitely feel the endurance!\n",
      "I would give it an 8.5 out of 10. Very good flavor, not to sweet but did have a good strawberry kewl flavor. I like the ingredients aswell, with amino acids, bccas, and green tea with a little bit of caffine. Could have more of these ingredients in each serving, but overall very good. I bought this when it was buy one get one free so 25.99 for two 50 servings containers was a great deal. Would buy again.\n",
      "I mainly use Amino+ intra-workout. I love the low dose of caffeine at 75 mg per serving. If I want to get some more intensity in the gym I just add another scoop. Sometimes I take a scoop in the morning and substitute Amino+ for coffee. It gets me going every time, and feeds my muscles much more than coffee would. My favorite flavor is hands down the Blackberry Lemonade flavor but I've tried all the flavors and you cant go wrong. I'm also a big fan of the open label, no proprietary blend, so you know what your paying for. \n",
      "Pretty good, I stay with 2 scoops.\n",
      "Great energy source, I do sip on it for a while, I felt great.\n",
      "I am getting new flavors in to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this.\n",
      "The flaver was great, not overpowering. I use my bcaa intra workout and on occasion in the morning with glutamine for recovery. I really liked this product and almost ordered it again until I realized it contains a lower dose of bcaa's than most bcaa powders per serving. I would just double the dose but there are better deals per serving and I try to get the best price for my supps. Overall great flavor and mixes well, but half the bcaa's per serving I'm looking for.\n",
      "Taste good, nice change from the usual ordinary flavors. Mixing in shaker left a layer of foam on top . Sometimes I noticed a medicine like after taste when a couple of unmixed clumps were left in shaker. For the BOGO offer, I would buy it again for the flavor choices. \n",
      "It's ok. Taste is good if you only use 1 scoop to 12+ oz of water. Otherwise I experience a weird aftertaste. I still prefer a different brand. But this was a good deal so I tried it. I would buy again if it's BOGO. \n",
      "\n",
      "I like to add one scoop in with my preworkout  for extra energy and aminos. I also take it after my workout for the extra energy and aminos. I have purchased a few different flavors and they are all good enough. I will buy this product again. \n",
      "I bought this primarily because I thought I was getting a good deal on some Aminos for both intraworkout and post workout recovery. \n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff mixes like crap. I tried a shaker cup, blender bottle, a glass with a spoon - it simply does not completely dissolve. Perhaps I should try an actual electric blender, but it's gonna be awfully inconvenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also foams up pretty badly. I even chucked my bottle in the fridge for over 30 mins and the stuff simply remained foamy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the taste of the wildberry pomegranate is pretty poor. It tastes neither like wild berries nor pomegranate. One of the worst tasting aminos I've ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you manage to chug it down, it works though. Will never buy again.\n",
      "Its great before a workout or even in he morning instead of a cup of coffee. The cherry honeycomb tasted good but a little on the sweet side. Its also good with a scoop of creatine for a pre workout.\n",
      "I'll keep it nice and sweet (like the powder) \n",
      "\n",
      "the Pineapple Mango is my absolute favorite of alllll the supplements i've had in past 3 years. Definitely gives you the energy to pull through the workout. it's so good, reward yourself for the workout by grinding up a smoothie with some real fruits and a scoop of this. \n",
      "\n",
      "other flavors were okay, \n",
      "I used it in the morning to replace my coffee. Worked great taste horrible and to much foam. Was  definitely  Worth the price at buy 1 get 1 free \n",
      "I view this product as an anytime 'pick-me-up' to give yourself a boost of energy and wakefulness. As this product contains Carno-Syn (beta-alanine) you may experience a very slight \"tingly\" or \"jitter\" sensation you would feel in other products (mostly pre-workout). It has less caffeine that a cup of coffee, so your not overloading your body with caffeine like you would with an energy drink, but if you need the EXTRA boost, it is safe to add another scoop!\n",
      "The taste was great, it didn't have a horrible after taste but also wasn't bland or too sweet! I definitely felt more awake and alert during the time I took it. It seemed to help give me more energy and my body felt a lot more awake and alert.\n",
      "Like the other ErgoGenix products, solubility was great, no chunks, no lumps!\n",
      "The great thing is your feeding your body the amino acids you need to help recover and build muscle, so your getting the best of both worlds with this product.\n",
      "After using it for about 2 weeks, it is now sitting on my desk at work as I use it almost daily to give myself that little boost of energy I would normally rely on a $6 Starbucks drink to give me. At a cost of around $0.65 per serving, its a great investment and something I will ALWAYS have on my desk or in my supplements cupboard!\n",
      "Solid product. Flavors are good. Mix it with little ice and it will get rid of most of the foam that accumulates while mixing. A very good amino and energy blend. I like to take it in the mornings to replace coffee or on my off days when I got lecture in college. Used it for a while as a pre workout. (2 scoops) Gives you a nice focus and good amount of energy to finish a workout. I can't take it on the afternoons, (5 to 6 pm) is hard to sleep at night. Not sure if is because of the ingredients but other preworkouts I don't have problems with. That's why I started taking it on mornings. Anyways good product probably will buy again. \n",
      "Wow, I definitely enjoyed my 3 tubs of this so far!!!  Great taste and energy.  It can be used in place of morning coffee, intra workout, or pre workout.  Pineapple mango is my favorite nice and sweet tropical taste and my wife loved wildberry pomegranate.  We've went through 3 tubs in a few weeks.  I know we're hooked and price is great!\n",
      "The taste is really great. I use it during my workouts and has really helped me push through it. Great product. Also helps with recovery. Mixes really well. Definitely recommend it to anyone. I purchased these buy 1 get 1 free. Can't beat the price for BCAA's in powder form.\n",
      "As far as energy and recovery, this is great. When it comes to taste, it's probably one of the worst tasting supplements that I have ever tried. I love cheery and I love honey, so I decided on the Cherry Honeycomb flavor. At first you get a nice cherry flavor, but that quickly goes away and is replaced by a very bitter and harsh menthol and cough syrup flavor. Not even the good kind of cough syrup, it's just horrible on the taste. It truly was all that I could do to chug this down, it sure isn't something you'll want to sip and enjoy. I will continue to use it until it's gone, but the flavor is just terrible.\n",
      "1st off taste is on point! Cherry Honeycomb has quickly become my favor flavor of any supplement i have ever had. \n",

      "another HR by ERGO. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked this a lot. Used it to get me cut for the summer and then took another 2 month supply with me while I backpacked Europe. I ate and drank everything in sight without gaining much weight and still having some definition till the end. Great appetite suppressant and gave me a lot of energy. I will definitely buy this again.\n",
      "\n",
      "have used for over a month and got zero results, no boost of energy or anything.  I actually use it when I can't get to sleep.  I take two and fall asleep within 30 minutes.\n",
      "Appetite suppression is great for this, and it's also a low-stim thermogenic, so it can be stacked without much effect. I took it for 14 days, and had to stop because of the dopamine ingredients. For me, it was too much. There are 3 ingredients in here that promote increased dopamine production in the brain. I figured it would give me a good mood, but all that extra dopamine put my brain in a fog. The thing is, everyone's body chemistry regarding dopamine is different so I can't say that this is a good or bad product for all. I know the appetite suppression is great, but that's about all I got out of it. \n",
      "This is a good effective thermogenic. I workout in the mornings at 5am and I take the 2 pill serving immediately following my workout. I have been using this product now for three weeks and I am down 15lbs along with dropping my bf%, I have seen great results with ergocut. My results were also due to me following a clean diet. Ergocut gives me the engery I need to get me through my day after a brutal workout. As far as appetite goes, my cravings have been curbed I have to remind myself to eat every 2.5 to 3 hours. You may also experience mood enhancement while using this product which is another perk. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good thermogenic. My workout buddies all ordered a bottle after seeing my results and are using this product as well. A must have product to add to your stack for cutting. \n",
      "All I have to say is that ErgoPRE is the real deal.  It's pretty intense and it's not just because of the 300 mg's of caffeine (My previous two pre's have had the same amount).  Good pump, concentration and endurance along with no \"crash.\"  You could easily workout for 2 hours with no problem with just ONE scoop.  All I can say is that you should get your hands on a sample and you will end up buying a tub.  No, I didn't receive this product for free in exchange for a positive review.\n",
      "Ok its time... I have nothing to say but AWESOME. I get a nice warm energy about 15-20 min after taking. No jitters, no stomach discomfort or bloating. Taste well the ratings speak for itself. Apple Berry is like a Honey Crisp and berry mix. The best apple mix I have tasted. Glacier, I will say if you have ever liked the candy Smartees, well this is the drink. \n",
      "I just purchased this Pre workout powder a few days ago. I have used many different pre's from high to low stimulant, arginine to citrulline, etc. etc. \n",
      "     This pre workout gave a great pump from the 6 grams of citrulline (I like 6-8 grams) and the 300mg of caffeine was very adequate along with the 1 gram of L-Tyrosine to keep me focused mentally.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the price, it's definitely a product worth trying.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very good preworkout for a very good price !\n",
      "I try glacier flavor without having an idea what taste a glacier, but it taste really really good !\n",
      "i was looking for a preworkout to replace pre jym  ( i know prejym is a complete pwo but pricy too) so i was lookng for a good energy and focus and a big pump. that what i got with ergo pre !\n",
      "6 g of citruline malate for the pump and 2 g of beta alanine, nice focus and energy ingredient.\n",

      "i think i found my prejym replacement !\n",
      "I bought this BCAA in capsules and this is a great product by EVLUTION. Its pretty easy to take them at any time. The BCAA with the White Grape taste is absolutely delicious!! And the Lemon Lime reminds me of gummy bears!! It is a must for me to take it while working out! I usually take 2 servings during my workout, 7 days a weeks. Best BCAA I have ever had, by far! And I have taken a lot of BCAA! Great quality! Thanks EVL!!\n",
      "Gives you good mood in the morning !\n",
      "The product works really well. I take it routinely before or right after my workouts. You'll notice a difference in recovery time and overall energy after working out 5 days in a row. However, the unflavored powder makes me want to throw it up. Even when mixed with the best tasting ever pre workout EVL Pre-Work Out Green Apple. I won't order this product again. The Green Apple Evolution pre workout is fantastic but this flavor just bombs it.\n",
      "Really good product i would really recommend this to anyone trying to get more muscle, also i dont get as sore anymore helps me recover faster. I got the unflavored powder and it really is unflavored lol i stack it up with my pre workout and my evl protein after my workout. Evl is becoming my favorite brand all their products are awsome!!\n",
      "This is a staple in my stash of supplements! Keeps me feeling full and my energy levels up! Love this stuff!\n",
      "Great product. Just mix with crystal light. I began taking while prepping for a show. Really helped me to maintain muscle while I tried loosing every ounce of fat that I could. I take it during my workouts, early in the morning and before bed.\n",
      "For the last two months, the unflavored BCAAs has been my go-to drink. I mix it in a large water jug or shaker with a flavoring electrolyte powder (I use hydra charge by Kaged Muscle) and then relax for the rest of the day staying hydrated and actively anabolic. This also helps when you go long periods of time without eating, the BCAAs help you stay anabolic or when you're eating a meal without a lot of protein. For instance having a meal full of carbs but not a lot of protein like a salad or grains. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the price, it's hard to beat as well. Alongside this product, I use several other EVL products like ENGN, L-Carnitine, BCAA energy, just to name a few. I trust the brand and i have reordered this product several times. \n",
      "Love this product been taking it for several months and it gives me what i need. Love the company! Definitely recommend. This is becoming my number one choice in bcaas. Endurance has picked up and my overall recovery has shortened!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have taken both the capsules as well as the powder. Between the two the powder is what I prefer. I throw it in my pre-workout and my post workout protein. Depending on how you take it, you can taste the flavor of it which takes a few servings to get used to. After that I don't really notice the taste.\n",
      "This product is great! Being unflavored it actually pretty great too since you can add it to basically anything. This is such a great product that I will continue to use! Ive also recommended to others and they have also seen a change but while using other products and working out! I only use EVL products and I can definitely say they have helped with the way I look and workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "This USB when best tasting bcai have ever gotten...not too sweet and didn't taste heavy or syrupy like some other brands. This is good drinking during workout or to add some flavor to your daily water\n",
      "This is an excellent BCAA powder, and it has been my go to bcaa for the last year, and the quality has always been superb, but don't get me wrong I have a big stack of supplements and this goes down the hardest, its almost impossible to drink with water without something flavored, I usually pour the scoop into my mouth and chug it down with water, and that needs a bit of getting used to so I would suggest getting the flavored one if taste is a big issue for you.\n",
      "I have the capsule form. Personally I give them an 8 for 2 reasons. First being the dosage. It recommends 8 capsules per serving and 1-3 servings per day. That alone is ridiculous and not likely to be followed. Second is the fact that I'm unsure it really does anything. 'Most of my other supplements I can tell with ease the effect and that they are working. With bcaas I'm not too sure it does anything. A pro to this is that it is really cheap to buy so it's not a big deal that I don't feel it much.\n",
      "I ended up trying the bcaa 5000 to see if this would be a good fit for my supplements routine... Needless to say, I was quite happy with the results. The only down side to this is the recommendation for doses is 8 tablets per serving... That's 24 pills for just bcaa. I luckily I prefer pills... I do wish that EVL can somehow incorporate all 8 pills into a lesser form. Such as 2 pills per serving because bloating does takes place when trying to consume all of the supplements in a person's regiment. Which can be roughly 4 to 6 depending on variables. Plus the 8 for bcaa. #EvlSupplements4Life #Testing4Gainz #GainzAreReal\n",
      "I buy the the unflavored powder and I take it during my workouts. I would recommend mixing it with something flavored because with water alone it doesn't taste too great. I usually mix mine with powerade or mio drops. it mixes well and I can use a different flavor everyday. It's a great product,  it really helps me during my workouts from getting too fatigued too quickly. \n",
      "I take the BCAA about 30 minutes before a workout to help reduce fatigue and increase endurance. This stuff works great whether you are particpating in a HIIT Workout, or you are trying to crank out a few more reps during a swol session at the gym. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is try to push the threshold of their performance!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers!\n",
      "EVL's BCAA5000 is my go to BCAA. The unflavored mixes great with my preworkout and post workout protein.\n",
      "Great product I've been working out 6 days a week for the last 4 months and managed to drop 50 pounds. Recovery time is excellent and I continue to use it today. \n",
      "This product is great! While being on this product I have seen a drastic change in my body.. But that only came with working hard too!! This is such a great product that I will continue to use! Ive also recommended to others and they have also seen a change but while using other products and working out!\n",
      "I was skeptical about it being unflavored, but it is great to mix with your protein for recovery after your workout. Mixes well and definitely helps with recovery after a a good lift. \n",
      "Take a scoop pre and post workouts and noticed I am less fatigued and with proper training and diet and I can see a.huge difference,  And this BCAA is a lot cheaper than what's out there. EVL has become my favorite brand to go to. Recommend this stuff. Mix it with the birthday cake protein \n",
      "This product is purely amazing. I take it twice a day. Once before a workout and once right after a work out. It definitely help with recovery and help you bounce back. Highly recommended.\n",
      "This is a great addition to any drink you like to mix it with. I can make my own intraworkout by adding it to any electrolyte drink or drink it throughout the day by mixing it with juice or lemonade. I don't even notice that it's there. \n",
      "My absolute favorite BCAA I've discovered so far. Lemon lime is the best flavor I've ever tried. Not overwhelming or hard drink. I drink it twice a day & never get tired of it & I feel great. Mixes well with none of the gross BCAA flavor some brands have. I'll continue to buy this product from now on. Reminds me of lime sherbet. I really can't describe just how delicious this flavor is. \n",
      "EVL being one of my go to brands, I obviously had to check out their BCAA's when they were on sale! Taste is a little like chalk, but is irrelevant when mixed with something like preworkout. Seems to do a great job. Ever since I started taking it, I haven't had quite so sore days, or the penguin walk 2 days after leg day. All around I definitely feel recovery faster than without it. Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "BCAA are essential in an effort to get your desirable physique. Yes they are in the food you consume but for good recovery and in turn muscle gain. This is a great product to get the right amount of bcaa in you program and get the recovery your looking for. Great pricing as well 👍🏻\n",
      "I am a big fan of Evl BCAA 5000. I have almost used a few 60 serving tubs and I definitely notice a difference in recovery time. Because it is unflavored you can mix it in your preworkout for an extra boost or put it in your post workout shake. I recommend trying this product if you are looking to enhance the effectiveness of your post workout shake, which I believe is very important (add some creatine too).\n",
      "I want to like this product, I really do, especially at the price, but the taste is terrible. I though unflavored wouldn't be so chemically tasting but I can't mix it with anything and not taste it. It doesn't mix well either, when you add water it gets trapped in the bubbles and doesn't seem to dissolve. So it's gritty tasting through out the drink. I wish I could recommend something better but this is my first go at  BCAA powder. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great BCAA choice if you don't want to mix a powder. The capsules have no taste and go down easy. I personally like having recovery supplements available quick.  So not needing a shaker bottle or funnel is convenient.  I usually use a powder preworkout in combination with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: You can't go wrong with these bcaa capsules. They are efficient and do their job.\n",
      "Great product. I have used a vary large variety of BCAA's and I would recommend this one.\n",
      "Love this company great products. I drink while I'm working out n it feels good.\n",
      "Excellent product to throw in a post workout shake. Doesn't alter the flavor or make it taste too powdery. Will definitely purchase again.\n",
      "The product mixed very well and was tasteless. It definitely helped with recovery and endurance. I would absolutely buy again. I would recommend.\n",
      "I purchased the pill form and was surprised to see the serving size was 8 pills. Not a big fan of how the pills float either... makes them harder to swallow. Ill buy the powder form next time\n",
      "This is a very good product, but taking into account the weight of the product and postage, hoping to provide more discounts. \n",
      "Product is GREAT for the price. HOWEVER, get the flavored version; unflavored does not taste good at all...\n",
      "Great product , i have the bcaa pills and they work just fine. i recommend to anyone either the powder form or pill. .\n",
      "I bought this more than twice from Bodybuilding and love this EVLproduct talking it once in day and post workout really shows me recovery and would love to buy more in future.This is the best product I have tried ever and would continue with this as recovery and results are really awesome with this .\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend BCAA 5000 to everyone! It's available in an unflavored version which is perfect when combining it w/supplements that are already flavored! At 2 scoops it's especially useful as pre or intra-workout bcaa support. I'd like to see more unflavored or naturally flavored pre-workout/amino formulas, Thanks EVL!\n",
      "Evlution is on top of their game. I like using the capsules rather than a BCAA powder because one less shaker of liquid I have to slug down for a workout means one less frantic trip the the bathroom when trying to start my work day.\n",
      "i LOVE BCCA's and i was really excited to try this, but im really thankful i didnt take the buy one get one 50% off because this unflavored is terrible! as soon as i opened the container i could smell that awful stench... i figured unflavored would be nothing, no taste, easy to take down with water... boy was i wrong, i tried using this lastnight before my workout and i couldnt do it. i almost threw up in my truck trying to take a sip of it... sucks because i wasted $20 but, i definitely do not recommend getting unflavored unless you have an iron stomach. this container of 59 servings left is just going to sit in my cabinet now.\n",
      "Works great!!\n",
      "I use this product before and after workouts and throughout the day on rest days. The effectiveness of this product is a 10 and has proven to assist with muscle fatigue. I am rarely sore the next day and am able to keep a consistent routine due to fast recovery.  \n",
      "Only downside for me is the taste. White Grape is the only one I am able to actually sip on rather than chug down due to bad taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "EVLUTIONL NUTRITION is slowly becoming my favorite brand. This is probably their best product I have tried so far. I just finished my very first work out on it, which was chest day. I took this 30 min before my workout with 6g of citrulline malate and 1 tbsp of mct oil (i'm on keto).  Let's just say on my final working set of bench press last week, I was able to hit 225 for 5. Today I hit 225 for 6 with energy to spare. I couldve done 7, maybe 8 but I wanted to save my energy for incline dumbells.  I finished with my 15 min of HIIT on treadmill and wasn't nowhere near as tired as I usually am at that phase of my workout. I have to say I am impressed. I still have to test the recovery part but the energy is incredible.  The only prob I have with this so far is that the lemon lime tastes like butt when mixed with my chocolate flavored whey protein. \n",
      "Lemon Lime flavor was ok , the white grape was really good I recommend it over the lemon lime. Overall both great products, I push through my workouts better while drinking both of these and feel the difference! \n",
      "The product is doing what it's supposed to do . But the unflavoured taste is one of the worst things i've ever tasted. Horrible to drink.\n",
      "Seems to do what BCAA's are supposed to do, but the unflavored is terrible. \n",
      "I haven't tried any other BCAA manufacturer, this is due to what the EVL BCAA5000 product offered.  I have been using this product for over a month now and have seen and felt what this product provides.  I have especially felt this product aid in my recovery and muscle repair.  I have also felt the boost to my endurance when exercising, and felt the strength boost from this product.  I would recommend this product!   \n",
      "Another good one from EVL...I like this product because it isn't anything flashy but includes all your necessary BCAAS and includes the most proven and studied 2:1:1 ratio as well..love to use this product in conjuction with my pre workout or during my workout. \n",
      "Amazing results from the product, my only real complaint is that the unflavoured version of BCAA 5000 tastes like crushed pills! Not an easy swallow to say the least! \n",
      "I take this after my 3 hour workouts and am never sore after. This stuff is great. Only BCAAs I take. Definitely buy this! \n",
      "Pill form they are awesome. Powder form.... I struggled so I'll stick with the pills.\n",
      "This product is legit. Taste is pretty good and it definitely helps with muscle fatigue. Most of EVL nutrition products are a safe bet.\n",
      "Great product I got the unflavored capsules it's good to pop a few before every meal I have seen recovery times reduced with this product. and with the bogo 50 it's a no brainer EVL is the brand that I Goto first for anything I purchase \n",
      "Great product. I put it in my protein shake after my workout. It gave my protein shakes a weird taste and texture but it did it's job. It helped with my recovery and made me not as sore the day after I workout.\n",
      "my only issue with this BCAA product is it doesn't dissolve and that might not be such an issue the grains weren't so big.   \n",
      "This BCAA product is great. I use one scoop before and after my workout and I feel a difference. I can push myself longer and recovery is faster. I recommend this product, really great addition to your nutrition plan. Can't go wrong with EVL products. Great company!\n",
      "Great BCAA. I got the powder. It is truly tasteless and mixes great with any flavor post workout shake. I find myself buying more and more EVL products. Will try the pre-workout next! \n",
      "These BCAAs are great. I have tried several, but seems like I have had the best results with EVL  BCAA 5000. I  am starting to order a lot more supps from EVL because they have seem to be extremely efficient. Would definitely recommend these to others.\n",
      "One of the best BCCA powders I have ever had. Mixes great. No grit, no after taste. This will stay in my daily stack!\n",
      "Bought the 300 grams BCAA. It actually mixes really well but tastes horrible. Nevertheless, way more cheaper than other BCAA's around the market. Great product overall!\n",
      "BCAA5000 is a great affordable product that i recommend everybody use.  I benefited from it the most when mixing a serving into my post workout shakes and and in between meals.  The powder mixed very easily with whatever drink I chose to use.\n",
      "Completely satisfied with this product even reordered it once.  I take the capsules, I recover quicker and the pills are easy to take.  Will order again.  I prefer capsules over drinks right now for some reason,  I think I just got tired of all the sweetness and the fluids of drinking the BCAAs\n",
      "I just think it needs to many capsules to deliver the amount of BCAA stated on the label. 8 pills is too much. Powder in this case is an advantage.\n",
      "In resume, it´s good product. I like it anyways. \n",
      "Really is a good long lasting endurance booster. Fast acting. This product has great recovery benifits i felt the difference in my soreness the first day waking up after taking this. Great product all the around.  It dissolves quickly in any drink .\n",
      "Definitely feel like I could hit the gym more often.(less rest days) I love bcaa5000, I recommend it for sure. I've been packing on (lean)muscle and dropping fat like it's cool, well, it is cool, Haha. EVLnutrition has made a forever customer out of me. \n",
      "This is a pretty good BCAA product. This is only $10 and the bottle supplies 30 days. So for the price and the amount od very good. And even though it is cheap it is a Great product. Usually, you get what you pay for and if the price is low, the quality is low. But not in this case. Recovery time is great. When taking these pills I am very rarely sore. Would recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "I must say that I try to support/buy product without the aspartame, sucralose or acesulfame. If you're accustomed to the tasty BCAA drinks, it typically has all those ingredients and colorings and this may not be your drink. If you're going to \"taste test\" this item, don't taste test it at home because, it DOES NOT taste good and actually will produce a sour tasting face. Trying it while you're working out hard, it will not taste as bad. Yes, it's \"acceptable\" taste wise to me once working out. If I'm not at the gym, it's not something I wish to taste/drink. I guess drinking it while working out changes your taste buds or something. I told others that it's like being out in desert, you're so desperate that you'll drink dirty water and it'll still taste fresh and/or good. This BCAA definitely mixes well. It's hard to tell what's a plain water bottle vs the bottle you just poured your BCAA into. As far as performance, I'll have to rate it after a few weeks.\n",
      "I'm a huge fan of this new company, especially this product. Evlution's BCAAs are some of the most high quality BCAAs I've ever used, and they are not outrageously priced like others. I also like the fact they are unflavored and don't contain any fillers, which helps keep the cost low. These are pure BCAAs. I use these pre and post cardio and with my post lifting shake for added recovery. Give these BCAAs a shot, you will not be disappointed!\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best. I've been using it for a week but I felt the quality since day one. Awesome recovery, I feel ready for the next workout.  Only downside is that is more bitter than other brands but I don't mind because it works. \n",
      "Flavor is noted as unflavored but turns any mix quite bitter. While it gets the BCAA job done, next time I'm opting for the capsules over the powder. Mixed it with ENGN Apple pre work out and tasted quite good, but when mixed with C4 or optimum nutrition whey isolate, taste turned quite butter.\n",
      "Got the powder. Tastes awful. Ready to buy any other BCAAs.\n",
      "This is a great product, the taste is the same as all the other bcaas bitter, just put in your mouth and swig it down with water. But I definitely notice some enhanced energy during lifts and throughout the day when taking the product. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great product from Evlution Nutrition! Gives you a good dose of BCAA's for pre and/or post workout. Definitly noticed boosts in recovery and strength since taking the product. Will definitely get this product again, not to mention it's a great price for what it offers.\n",
      "For an unflavored BCAA, I must say it not only smells odd but greatly affects the flavor of a drink when stacking it. Be sure to add to something with tons of flavor! After using for several weeks I've found that fruit juices work well. I dilute OJ 50% with water and then add the BCAA. This way you're cutting the sugar and calories but still have a decent taste. Mixing with Vitamin water, Bai, and pre-workouts seems to work well. I've found that when not using the BCAA my recovery time is a little longer and endurance is a bit off during workout session.\n",
      "I take EVL BCAA 5000 daily to get a little extra in my day.BCAA 5000 is easy to take capsules with no dry burps or funny aftertaste.I recover faster and doms is pretty much non existent.I would recommend this to anybody who needs a little extra help with recovery or putting on some extra muscle\n",
      "Noticeable reduction in muscle soreness for me! Started using this about halfway through an 8-week Steve Cook plan and was able to feel the difference in not only recovery time, but maintenance of muscle mass while reducing body fat. \n",
      "Also, unflavored..flavor..really is unflavored; unlike most competing products. I throw it in with the ENGN pre-workout as well as my post-workout shake (it mixes easily and doesn't distort the taste of other products). Highly recommend. \n",
      "It's quite simple. Add a couple scoops to your shake and you're good to go. It really simplifies the process. If you go unflavored like I do, it simply takes on the flavor of the rest of your protein blend or whatever you choose to mix with.\n",
      "This is my first time using BCAA's aside from the ones in my protein shakes. I take it either before/after my workouts. For me this worked really well and feel good after a long workout. I enjoy the powder or caps both are easy to take\n",
      "Omg - this stuff is DISGUSTING. Who cares if it works! I literally just eyeballed the heck out of the remaining half I need to drink - and nearly puked thinking about drinking it! It's like drinking a liquid multivitamin.\n",
      "This product really works. I take it after workouts and I can definitely say that there is a big difference on how fast I heal now that I take this, it works really well. \n",
      "My recovery time on my muscles is cut down by half the time, stamina never drops off. I have recommended this product to everyone I know. Will definitely be getting more\n",
      "I've been using this product for a couple months now and I recommend it. It's helped me to not feel so fatigued and helped ease the amount of soreness I had after workouts!!\n",
      "solid bcaa product thats unflavored, easy mix and doesnt effect the taste of the protein too much when mixing. does what its suppose to do and thats provide recovery and gainz! \n",
      "I bought it in powder - and would not recommend it, the taste is bitter as hell. Even when you mix it with chocolate protein shake this bitter taste is still there.\n",
      "Should have ordered in pill form.\n",
      "I've always taken the pill form of BCAA's. I purchased this powder form to mix it up. For me personally, the taste is horrible! I gave it to a friend that said he doesn't notice it much. Whether I tried diluting it, concentrating it, putting it in my favorite drink, or whatever, I could still taste it and didn't like it at all. So I'm back to the pills. \n",
      "\n",
      "Love the recovery the bcaas give me! Helps me power through the next day's workouts without feeling too much of the aftermath. Love the pill and powder form! EVLution is amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my go to supplement for bcaa's.  I take it between meals pre and post workout. Is an excellent addition to add to anyone's nutrition.  I like this so much i even have the unflavored 60 serving powder it mixes great with protein shakes and my preworkout.  Love EVL products can't go wrong with this company.\n",
      "Very effective. Comes in powder or pill form for versatility. Reduces soreness and maintains that hard earned muscle you just gained from your workout\n",
      "Mixes very well and the taste while not good isn't very noticeable if you mix into a decent amount of water. I use this product during a workout it seems to help with recovery big time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worst BCAA's ever\n",
      "\n",
      "The product itself is awesome, it's very finely powdered and mixes very fast and works effectively. The taste of the unflavored is pretty horrrible, I have to mix it with a creatine fruit punch mix I currently use. I thought I would prefer the no additives and no flavorings approach but YUCK- it's like ground up bitter aspirin in your water. However, I would buy this again only in a flavored version or the pills. Excellent product minus the taste. And BB.com ships everything super fast ! very impressed.\n",
      "This has the proper ratio of BCAAs without all the other crap you find in amino supplements.  I add this to my chocolate protein shake and my only complaint is that it distorts the flavor of the shake a bit.  It makes it taste a little more chalky but its far from undrinkable (in fact, it sort of makes it taste like dark chocolate, just not as sweet).  I like the fact that the product is simply the BCAAs and in the optimal ratio and the price point is pretty good.  If you need additional BCAAs, this is the way to go.\n",
      "Simple BCAA product you can mix with your other products like protein or maybe a post workout drink. I like it allot cause it comes in pills as well. I tried the powder first but think next time ill get pills, seems easier.\n",
      "BCAA 5000 is a great post workout recovery supplement. It gives your body the nutrients it needs to keep the muscles from catabolism. When dieting this supplement is huge on my list of products. I really recommend this supplement.\n",
      "I bought this product a few weeks ago since I was needing some aminos and they were on a great deal. I have been using the bcaa's for about a week and it pairs great with mio. Since I have been using this I notice I haven't been as sore and the rest time between sets has decreased. I love EVL's products and this is just one more that I will continue to buy. \n",
      "Having used flavored BCAAs in the past I knew the unflavored would be a different taste. The best I can describe it is it tastes similar to crushed aspirin. I don't recommend this directly with water and nothing else unless you like that taste. I mix mine with Vega Recovery accelerator (tropical) and it completely masks the taste. As for the product, I like that it is not full of fillers and hidden sugars. \n",
      "I frequently sip on BCAA drinks throughout the day to give me energy and extra amino acids, but decided to try BCAA's in capsule form for the first time. I take a pre-workout before exercising and decided to add EVL BCAA 5000 capsules to help with soreness and recovery. Not only are the capsules more convenient, but I notice much more energy and focus during my workouts than with a pre-workout alone. I take a half serving before leaving for the gym and a half serving when I am done and have noticed a significant decrease in muscle soreness which typically lasts for two or three days after working out a muscle group. I highly recommend this product as a quick and easy way to add extra amino acids.\n",
      "Good BCAA to stack with a post workout shake or protein. Normally a capsule guy but the powder just makes life easier lol \n",
      "Just getting started with the BCAA5000, but I already enjoy it more than some of the other BCAAs I have used in the past. The unflavored capsules are much better than some of the disgusting flavored powders I have tried. You can take up to 3 servings, so it's perfect for use throughout the day to maximize recovery.\n",
      "This is a great unflavored BCAA. In the past I have used flavored BCAA's that I would say I prefer because as someone who only drinks water it is difficult to mix with just water. Great for adding to a pre or post workout drink. \n",
      "I was skeptical about trying a pill form of BCAA's at first, but man these are GREAT they really do help you recover fast.\n",
      "This is literally perfect for adding into protein shakes. It mixes well and gets you those extra BCAAs \n",
      "I have not tried an EVL product that I have loved and the Bcaa 5000 lives up to the EVL name. Does great for recovery. If you have not tried the brand before I recommend you do so, one of the best out there. \n",
      "I was looking for a unflavored version of BCAA among different brands and, as I’ve never had EV Nutrition before, I just gave it a try. I must say it does its work awesome. I take a serving before and after my workouts. My endurance and energy during the workout rise significantly and recovery is much shorter and smoother (I no longer feel super hungry next day after a hard training). I bought two versions - capsules and powder. Flavor-wise, the powder is okay. You can't expect it to taste good per se, but that's natural, and the taste is not that bad to be honest. I mix it just with water in a shaker cup and the solubility is great. I will definitely buy this product again.\n",
      "if taken properly, this product will shave recovery time down significantly. Although, if you are picky about taste i would recommend flavored bcaa EVL products.\n",
      "I like this BCAA it gets the job done. I have less recovery time. I will continue to buy this product.\n",
      "This product was horrible - I bought 2 on a promotion and had to throw them both out after just one taste.\n",
      "Very simple product works good when mixed with protein\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely noticed a difference in my recovery from work outs. Also I've had higher energy levels the next day too.There is no taste or after taste with this one. I put in some of my shake sometimes or just in water. It fully dissolves when you mix it so there is no left overs chilling in the bottom of the glass lol. All in all its a good product. I REALLY like it \n",
      "This a great Product ! I used to always buy other brands , but this one is a lot finer, it hasa good consistency and texture. However, it doesn't float away like other powders I've had... I guess the grains are a little heavier? It mixes great and is completely tasteless, I've had it on a spoon straight into my mouth with a sip of water... But I usually just blend it up in a smoothie together with my protein... I have nothing bad to say about it! I will be buying this one again . Luved  it! :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this Bcaa powder because it was on sale and the price per serving is unbeatable. I mix it with Gatorade during a Jiu Jitsu session and sometimes add to my protein when I have a really tough workout. In terms of its effectiveness, this product is great and helps with recovery. The unflavored powder is very bitter and does affect the flavor of whatever you mix it with and it is not the best. I can stand it because of the price and effectiveness but I don't want EVL to improve the flavor then jack up the price. Overall a solid product.\n",
      "Is unflavored so taste like medicine so i mixed it with PreWorkout. This gave me great energy throughout my workout and also fast recovery. Love that i felt energizes even after my workout \n",
      "I'm new to evlution products, but I bought this to replace my powder form bcaa. I was tired of taking a pre workout followed by bcaa. I figured a bcaa in pill form would help and overall it did. I would order this again, the only gripe I have is the serving size, 8 pills a serving is a lot in my opinion. The bcaa did what it was supposed to kept my energy up and soreness down. \n",
      "Good stuff, just make sure u mix it with se kind if flavoring. \n",
      "This product is unflavored, therefore making it very bitter. I have tried to mix this with my protein shake and it turns the shake very bitter as well. Basically anything you mix this with will make it horrible tasting. Best bet is to chug this stuff very quickly and have something flavorful to get rid of the nasty aftertaste. As far as if this product works or not, I cannot say since I have not been using it long. \n",
      "I've been training for over 10yrs and the \"unflavored\" is the most nasty, vile tasting product I have ever used. \n",
      "This product works good, I take it before my workout and after this is my first time trying it and I do like the results from it....but I got the unflavored powder because I take many different supplements and its easier to mix with others then making multiple shakes. The problem is the \"unflavored\" is not very unflavored at all. It leaves a bitter nasty taste to everything and the other supplements I take iv had before and I know its not them so maybe, if there is a next time I'll get the pill form!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "These BCAAs are great! I prefer pills over the powder because it's easier to use. This is another staple in my array of EVL products\n",
      "\n",
      "As a BCAA, it does what a BCAA is supposed to do. It provides aminos for endurance and recovery. The flavor, however, makes you question your commitment to your goals.  As an unflavored value buy, it does its job.  If you value your taste buds, I highly recommend purchasing flavored BCAAs or going for capsule form.  I personally mix this with a bottle of powerade + preworkout prior to lifting, and then with chocolate flavored protein postworkout... but neither combo masks the awful taste of the BCAA at all.  Buy these if cost is your priority. They're solid. If you're sensitive to taste or have some extra money to toss around on higher quality and flavor, then I recommend going that route.\n",
      "Overall not a bad product. It helps with soreness and recovery, but the taste is unbearable. I got unflavored figuring I could mix it with water or gatorade and drink it down, but it taste like how I imagine paste and paper shavings would taste. \n",
      "This product did as advertised.\n",

      "Bcaa's work well for muscle soreness and have noticed i don't feel as refreshed when I stopped taking them but the flavor ruins anything i mix it with its a chemical like flavor just nasty 💩\n",
      "I have never tasted something so horrible in my life that is \"unflavored\" they should label this flavor as \"dog turd\" ( and no, I haven't eaten a dog turd but this is what I imagine one tasting like) As far as the product itself, the results weren't bad at all. but the flavor...wow!! \n",

      "Very good product. \n",
      "This is an excellent BCAA product. I've noticed a difference since I started taking it. Great price. Only downside is the serving size is 8 capsules and recommended 3 times a day for best results. But if you don't mind taking a lot of capsules on a regular basis then I say go for it. I bought 4 more bottles of this because it's that excellent of a product. \n",

      "I use this CLA year round to help me get lean quicker when cutting, and then to keep off extra fat when bulking. It is easily one of the best and most cost affective ways to keep a good body comp. \n",
      "EVL never disappoints, this is another great product. If you pair it with eating right you will see results in the first few weeks. \n",

      "I can't say for sure how much of a role this product played, but I used this consistently for around 6 months alongside a good diet and training regimen. In that time I lost nearly 60 pounds. I didn't notice it making me feel any different like some others have stated in their reviews. I'm bulking right now, but will certainly be coming back to get some of this CLA when I am looking to cut again! Give it a try!\n",
      "This product worked great! It allow me to shed some weight while still adding muscle. Would recommend. \n",

      "Solid product!\n",

      "Another win, they are becoming one of my favorite brands. Good product at a great price....CLA is something I add in once in a while, I do feel it helps along with a good clean diet in losing fat. If you compare prices, this is one of the best out there in terms of $/serving. If you can time the deals right, getting these BOGO or even BOGO 50% off is a heck of a deal.\n",

      "Reason why I rate this 5 out of 10 is because when I purchased this, I thought the promotion was already entered in my shopping cart (2 for $30) so with their \"24/7 help\" I called customer service and no one picked up then I emailed BEFORE it was shipped and they said they couldn't do anything except return it when it came. Other than that,  I've tried this product before and it helps me.\n",
      "Started taking this as part of a new diet plan. I saw a drop in body fat percentage but I can't say its from the CLA or the diet change\n",

      "\n",
      "Great product, great results, no weird feelings. Would definitely recomend\n",
      "I normally stick to stim fat burners like transform but I decided to start stacking a stim free product and I have to say I noticed a big difference in pure fat loss when stacking this CLA. \n",
      "I bought 2 containers and consumed the recommended dose every and each day. No results at all.\n",
      "Ive used this product for about the last 8 months. In addition to a solid diet and lifting routine ive made a great transformation.\n",
      "Been taking this CLA product for close to two months now... Can see a difference in my metabolism/appetite & how lean I feel on days that I take it vs. days I forget to. Would recommend to those looking for that little extra help to cut some fat. \n",

      "Hi Folks, \n",
      "\n",
      "There are only a few supplements out there that are simple, proven scientifically, priced fairly, and that actually work.  CLA is one of that small number.  And EVLUTION CLA is the best I have found, checks all the boxes that is, on Bodybuilding.com.  Remember, only stuff that I consider crap works fast.  CLA works over time.  Take it as directed, eat reasonably, and it will work.\n",
      "CLA seems to be proven to help assist healthy fast loss - and this product does just that. Another great product from EVL. Will keep buying!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent product My friend advised me about the product\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love this CLA product! I originally purchased this last year while it was BOGO and I never looked back. This has become a mainstay in my supplementation and I will definitely keep buying it! :) I recommend this item for anybody looking to reduce their body fat.\n",
      "I was very happy, with the lack of after taste. No nasty burps after taking this. Does what it is supposed to do and is of good concentration. I bought mine on a Buy 1 Get 1... so it was a great buy for me. \n",
      "I went ahead and purchased this product due to the sale that they were having. (BOGO) \n",
      "They're clear/yellowish capsules that are easy to get down, and for me there was a small after taste. Overall, I have seen results, even though I am not 100% dieting. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would purcahse again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this product to help me jump start my weight loss journey.  I choose this product because it's high potency cla from a reputable company.  Easy to take no gi issues.\n",
      "Great stuff! About to finish my second bottle and just reordered 2 more bottles. Can visually see the results with proper diet and exercise. Been now using all EVL products; protein, cla, carnitine, bcaa energy (love this stuff) and the z matrix. All Great products with reasonable prices. \n",
      "This product is top notch, nice clean packaging, no filet ingredients. It is easy to take and sis in weight loss and overall health. Nothing but the best quality I have come to expect from EVLUTION NUTRITION!\n",
      "Noticeably helped to lean me out during my cut. Great product\n",
      "Great product, my wife and I both use EVL CLA and couldn't be more pleased with the continued results.\n",
      "I really enjoy this product. It has helped with fat loss. I enjoy that it is very easy to take and there aren't many servings to take throughout the day.\n",
      "I love this product from EVL! I have been using this for a few months and it has become a staple in my supplements. It helps in body composition and aids in fat loss when used correctlyrics. I take it after each meal and it has definitely helped with my definition.\n",
      "I plateaued in my journey, and I already eat pretty healthy and thought I'd give this a shot since it had good reviews and I got it on a promo of buy one get one free. I just finished one bottle and it didn't help me drop any fat, I noticed no difference in anything. Don't know why it didn't work for me, I took it as directed. I'm at about 18-20% body, looking to drop to about 15%. Disappointed because I'm sensitive to stimulants so caffeine products are not an option. Have it a 2 because it's stimulant free at least.\n",
      "I've never used CLA's before and I was  skeptical if it would work and it did I lost about 15lbs in a month without a diet or exersise change it works but it takes about 2 weeks before you start seeing results.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I take 4 grams of CLA a day, and I seen results with a good diet and exercise. I plateau at 320lbs, started taking CLA, then the weight loss started back.\n",
      "This product is great been bulking for a month or so now and I've kept the same body fat percentage this whole time. It's pretty amazing since I don't always eat the cleanest when I'm bulking. Really evlution has nailed every product I've purchased from them so far.\n",
      "I decided to pick this up as it was on BOGO sale. Seems to work great, I've lost a couple inches all the way around since I first started taking it. It doesn't have any taste, or after taste, so it's very easy to take. Great product!\n",
      "Just fine 👍\n",
      "This was a staple of my previous weight loss supplement regimen. I highly recommend this and will buy again. \n",
      "I am an NPC Natiknally qualified men's physique competitor and I have used this product  during every one of my contest preps. I love the benefit I get from this product from a muscle recovery standpoint as well as being able to burn body fat as much needed fuel for the vigorous workout routines I go through. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to lean out and cut up their physique for whatever reason. \n",
      "This product does the trick. Easy to use and affordable! Thank you! Will be buying again!\n",
      "\n",
      "CLA is a solid addition to anyone looking to lean/tone up. It's not a miracle worker, but with the addition of exercise, eating healthy, and stacking with other products such as LeanMode or Trans4orm from EVL, you will find it gives you a small addition of toning down body fats from Conjugated Linoleic Acid. Adding this to your daily routine will help in fat loss, but remember you only see the best results with daily exercise and eating right in conjunction with CLA. \n",
      "Great CLA at a fantastic price point (with the BOGO deal), will buy again!\n",
      "Item does seem to do a little fat burning. But it could also be from other items used too be a fat burner. Either way the concoction is doing it's job. I have noticed great affects in reaching my goals. So if your trying to get more cut this item is useful, but you might need a little assistance from another fat burner to kick it up.\n",
      "This combined with leanmode has really helped me keep my weight in control while slowly increasing calories.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would highy recommend CLA1000 as not only is it affordable, but that it works well. I have noticed that in the time that I've started using it in combination with exercising and a mostly proper diet that I've been getting leaner. Definitely like the fact that this is a stimulant free weight management aid.\n",
      "Very good product I'm on my second bottle & I'm seeing results. Can't beat the BOGO price either.\n",
      "Using this product to help keep/build muscle mass while shedding fat.   Great clean CLA here.  The guys at EVL nutrition have made anouther killer product! \n",
      "If you aren't using CLA you need to get it! CLA is a stimulant free weight management supplement and thats great for taking at anytime of the day. With my busy schedule there are times I have to workout after work; which is close to bedtime and I hate being wired all night from crazy stimulants.\n",
      "Guys this is the Real Deal!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've seen the change in a month getting rid of stubborn fat. CLAs combined with Yohimbe supplement pre workout and you're a beast!\n",
      "This product by far has helped me retained my lean muscle mass and also has helped me tremendously in the bodyfat and weight department as I have been able to maintained my weight under 180 lbs. to get me ready for Nationals coming up in Sept. in Colorado..\n",
      "This stuff rocks!! Really helps me when I am leaning out. \n",
      "I have taked half a bottle and I don't realy see the result.\n",
      "I hope to see some reasult soon.\n",
      "CLA has helped big time with my muscle gain and weight loss. My weight hasn't changed much, but body fat and lean muscle mass has! Love how much it's been able to help me attain my goals in the month I've been using it \n",
      "I've used this product since August 2015 and I love it. I had just finished competing and was looking for something to help me get leaner but not lose any more muscle for my next show in September... Well I came in the same weight but tighter than ever. From 17% body fat to 10%. Definitely a fun of this company and their products!\n",
      "I love this product! I've gone through two bottles so far, and i've lost about 11 pounds of fat in the past 6 weeks. I take about 4-6 grams per day, and have not experienced any negative side effects. I have taken a CLA supplement before with great results, and I wanted to start taking them again to cut down for a trip i'll be going on soon. I bought these because of all of the great ratings, and I must say that it lives up to it's hype and then some. I bought a few more during the buy-one-get-one promo, because these are really a staple in my supplement box. I love that these are stimulant-free, so I can take them anytime and anywhere without feeling anxious. I am aware that people are pretty skeptical about this product, but it works for me! I'm definitely a EVL NUTRITION fan and have purchased some of their other products since trying their CLA!\n",
      "This is a great cla product. I have tried a couple different ones out on the market and found most success with EVL's version. No its not a magic pill, but it can aid you to drop a couple stuborn pounds. I didn't add any extra cardio to my workout routine and was still able to drop an extra few pounds in a month, where I was struggling to drop any weight before.\n",
      "Just started using this but Ive used Lean mode and transform and gotten great results looking forward to the same. \n",
      "I am reviewing this product after I've used up roughly 8 bottles. It may take a little time to start seeing some results. Obviously with a healthy eating plan and workouts this CLA can help burn that extra body fat that you want off.  I use 1 with each meal (3 per day). A great company with another good product. Give it a try! \n",
      "I've taken a lot of different CLA products but this one doesn't cause me to get stomachs upsets like other brands. One bottle will last you a month. It takes about a month for CLA to really get working but it maybe different for everybody. I believe that it really made a difference in my body and will definitely will  buy this again.\n",
      "I switched to this after using Infinite Labs and saw no changes also. Rather disappointed...\n",
      "\n",
      "Another good EVL product. Repeat buyer. Been very happy with these CLAs for the past 8 months.\n",
      "Good CLA I like to stack it with my fat burning stack. Its good when trying to shed some fat and doesn't have stims so you can take before bed. \n",
      "Very great product, especially for the price. Taking one capsule 3 times a day and noticed some reasonable results within 3 weeks of use. A great item that can fit into any weight loss stack.\n",
      "I have been using this product for about 2.5 weeks now and did notice a change in body composition! i couldn't be happier. this is a great addition to my stack and to make it even better i placed an order for the Carnitine500 to pair it with the CLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great product if you're looking for a little help in burning fat. Added this to my stack, took it as per recommended on the bottle, and combined with a strict diet I've definitely started seeing results. As far as taking the pills, they go down easily, and I've yet to experience any negative side effects. Would definitely recommend this to anyone! \n",
      "\n",
      "Great high quality CLA.  I've been taking EVL CLA for quite sometime now, and I definitly have seen the benefit. I've tried a few other CLA products from other manufacturers, but EVL has the best quality and priced CLA. I truly enjoy and trust this brand.\n",
      "only been using product for about a month... have noticed a decrease in body fat.... \n",
      "Highly recommend. No bloating or bad taste. Does what it's supposed to do. All EVL products are great. Personally snagged 2 of these\n",
      "\n",
      "I just started taking these, all I can say is EVL once again hit it out of the park!! Love the results. EVL is a brand that without a doubt I trust! Try Em guys, you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Great product definitely help me with my weight loss plateau. Love all this company's products and have never been disappointed with the results. Highly recommended this product as well as all the rest of the products evl has to offer for your fitness goals!\n",
      "I have been using this product for about a month for the first time ever, and I think it is great! I've noticed a boost in metabolism as well as fat loss. I also stack this with other EVL products, and workout daily. I would definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "This is my favorite CLA because I can take one capsule three times a day compared to others where you have to take three capsules three times a day. I prefer taking one before I workout to aide in fat loss and lean muscle. \n",
      "EVL CLA-1000 will definitely aid in fat loss and metabolic boost. You can feel the difference as soon as you start taking this daily. \n",
      "\n",
      "Price is always good as well!\n",
      "\n",
      "I pair CLA with EVL Vita-mode, EVL ENGN, and BCAA.\n",
      "The CLA 1000 has helped me stay on track to losing body fat and gaining muscle mass. I used it in combination with a simple diet and adequate exercise while I was training for a 10k and knocked 5 minutes off my previous race time. Since it is stimulant free, I don't get the jitters like the other weight mangement products I've used. I would recommend this product to others who are training and want to push past the plateau of losing body fat.\n",
      "CLA 1000 is amazing. I have been taking it for about 2 months and already seeing results.\n",
      "One of the best CLA products out there. Great Quality, Great Price, and Great results! Stimulant Free! And awesome when stacked with other EVL products!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am seriously hooked on EVL Brand products. I can promise you if it is EVL it is a great quality product! I stumbled upon EVL in Feb. when i started my weightloss journey and they have really helped enhance it every step of the way. I currently stack Trans4orm, LeanMode, CLA, Cartnitine. I also take the BCAA Energy and Stacked protein. All that combined with strict diet and exercise and I am down 29 lbs in just 2 short months! I promise you will not be disappointed with any EVL product that you try, I haven't!\n",
      "This product really curbs my appetite. I find myself steadily eating less which forces me to eat smarter not harder! I love it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep it up EVL!\n",
      "gotta say I'm pretty disappointed with this product. I haven't noticed any difference using this product for three weeks. I see the normal changes I get when I zone and crossfit. no added difference using this product... I have two bottles which kinda sucks. \n",
      "Great product and great results when used correctly. I saw the results within a week and will stick with this product for a long time to come. Give it a try.\n",
      "Definitely great bang for your buck. At first I wasn't to sure about this supplement for the price. Boy was I mistaken. It worked just as well as other more expensive companies that make CLA. \n",
      "Its exactly what you are looking for in a CLA product. 1000mg and not over priced. \n",
      "Easy to take CLA pills in 1000mg servings are the standard you expect. No after taste. Solid product.\n",
      "\n",
      "great product\n",
      "Highly recommended. The EVL company is my go too everytime. Hoping to be sponsored by them in the future because their products have helped me transform. CLA is just one of many great supplements in their Arsenal .\n",
      "Really great product from EVL. Since I have started taking CLA I have noticed an increase in my recovery from my workouts, and I have started to lose unwanted body fat. I would recommend this product to others.\n",
      "I have tried many weight loss products but nothing like this. So far I've lost 15 pounds with Evl products including CLA1000 with proper diet and exercise. It's the best CLA out there !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This company does not make a bad product. The CLAs will certainly help you maintain muscle while burning fat! The best part? It's insanely affordable. Worth it every time. \n",
      "I have seen a real change in my body fat especially in my abdominal area.  Great product!\n",
      "I just bought this product so I can't tell you how well it works yet.  I bought EVL CLA because it had the best price with their BOGO offer.  My main concern at this point is whether or not EVL packaged a 100% (or close to 100%) CLA formula.  Or did they decrease the potency in order to meet this incredible price point?  I'm not ready to say Yay or Nay yet but it would be nice if an EVL representative could confirm what percentage of pure CLA they formulated.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that I wouldn't be able to compare that percentage to any of their competitors because nobody is saying what they have.  However the few scientific studies done on CLA have mentioned what potency was used in the study.  So you would at least have something to compare to EVL CLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for now EVL CLA you get a 6 from me.  Why the 6 instead of 5 if I can't say it's good or bad?  Well I did buy product after all.  So that should count for something at least.\n",
      "I love this cla1000 it's help kick start my body out of its plateau and help me burn more fat faster and just helps me improve my over all day I've tried cellucor and muscle pharm cla but evl had been the best for me\n",
      "I am a huge fan of CLA and EVL makes quality CLA. I weight train 5 times a week and CLA really helps with recovery after my workouts. It reducing body fat while increasing lean muscle mass. Basically, it maximizes the results I would get with weight training alone. I think if you weight train, you should definitely consider taking CLA. With EVL, you get 90 tablets that are taken 3 times a day with a meal. The pills are soft gels and remind me very much of fish oil supplements. I actually got them confused with my fish oil the first time I used them. Since they are sift gels, they are extremely easy to swallow despite the size. So far, I have no complaints with this supplement. \n",
      "CLA is the missing link to every failed fat loss attempt, and this is the best CLA product I've found. It's a high, pure dosage of CLA which when added to any workout regiment and healthy diet will melt away the pounds! Thank you EVL and keep putting out awesome products!\n",
      "You can not beat the Price: Quantity ratio. On top of that i am in competition prep and in two weeks paired with RSP L-Carnitine and a dieting i lost 11lbs in 2weeks and leaner than i have EVER been, and my metabolism is through the roof! I will definitely buy again.\n",
      "I have been using CLAs consistently for about 5 months and just tried out EVL CLAs for about the last two.  Awesome deal where I got it BOGO so this stack will last me a while!  In general it takes a while to see and feel results from CLAs but you gotta just keep at it!  My metabolism is nice and sped up with consistency of CLAs in general.  Good product since you get your money's worth!\n",
      "This is the first product I purchased through EVL. I saw immediate progress within a few weeks - despite my skepticism. Love this crew. Thank you!\n",
      "ive been using it for 10 days now i dont know when it starts to act, but till now i dont see any changes my apetite is the same and no metabolic rate up anyway im gonna finish it and see if it will work later\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a bad product, the results aren't immediate, but I definitely noticed increased weight loss over time. To achieve good results, you need to be taking considerably more than recommended 3 capsules with every meal and it's a powerful supplement.\n",
      "I love this CLA supplement!  I like that it's stimulant free, and it seems to be doing it's job.  I'll keep buying this, and it's a great price!\n",
      "I have been taking this product for 2 weeks now and have not noticed any physical changes.  Appetite remains the same but does provide a little energy.  I missed lunch dosage so I took it at night.  I had a hard time falling asleep. I don't think I will buy it again but willing to finish bottle to see if I gain results. \n",
      "So far the best CLA ive had. took those craving away and provided the perfect energy. \n",
      "i'm feeling much better now\n",
      "This is my third time buying this CLA and I love it! I love that it's stimulant free and I don't get jittery after taking it. I started seeing results in just two weeks around my mid section! And it's super affordable for a college student like myself. \n",
      "Ive had a few different CLAs but I continue to buy this one. You may get more capsules from another company, but with EVL CLA1000 you just have to take one per meal compared to taking several at a time. Also its a great deal on bodybuilding.com.\n",
      "My go to brand for CLA! Its a staple in the supplements I take, no bad after taste, and not diluted with anything else added. Straight cla. Its reasonably priced as well!\n",
      "Been using CLA for a couple of years now and I believe it has helped me while losing 79lbs and while adding weight back on by helping me maintain lean mass and cut fat.EVL CLA 1000 is a top quality CLA product that I have used during that time and will continue to use going forward.I recommend the use of EVL CLA 1000 in your everyday supp arsenal wether cutting or bulking.\n",
      "CLA is a big staple in my training and protocol to help with my fat loss and keeping healthy throughout my contest prep.  I absolutely love the products from EVL and I am always ordering them online. Many of the CLAs on the market leave a nasty after taste and give me heartburn, but not from this brand. I would highly recommend this product. \n",
      "This product is absolutely phenomenal. I have used several other brands of CLA's before trying this one out. To be honest, I switched to this product because it was much cheaper than the other ones I was using. This ended up benefiting me phenomenally because it was the most effective! Great product, brand and price!\n",
      "I absolutely love CLA1000 by EVL.  I now only buy and use EVL products :-) I've noticed that since using it I've noticed even a smaller tummy, tighter midsection and an increased awareness after taking it.  Highly recommended and you'll see that you too will become a frequent buyer of EVL products and CLA 1000.\n",
      "EVL CLA1000 is great for the price and after a month or some of taking this produced I really saw a difference in my physique!\n",
      "I love EVL Nutrition CLA. I have used many other brands before with no results . Once I started it has helped me with lean muscle mass and recovery plus added to my eating I overcame a plateau . I would highly recommend EVL . \n",
      "I absolutely love EVL CLA. Has undoubtedly been the best product I have used in this category. Has helped me maintain a toned physique, and kept the body fat away. Would recommend.\n",
      "I was told by a work out buddy to try CLA1000. So I did. It is amazing, it does what it says! If you are looking to add muscle and burn off some more body fat I would recommend this product! It has helped me drop almost 8lbs extra since using it. Great buy for a great price. \n",
      "I've been taking CLA1000 for a few weeks now and it really helps with keeping my bf% low while putting on more lean weight/muscle (paired with a good nutrition/workout plan of course). Since taking these ive put on about 5 lbs (currently 143lbs) with the bf staying reasonably low around 9-9.5%. The pills aren't super big and go down easy. My definite go to for a CLA supplement that will not disappoint.\n",
      "This is the best CLA I have ever tried. Definitely worth the purchase. I started seeing results within a couple of weeks.\n",
      "One of the best CLA products out there. Great price, great quality. Anyone who uses CLA knows that there aren't any immediently noticeable side effects and therefore many CLA products perform similarly. That being said what you're looking for in a CLA is cost effectiveness and brand quality. EVL as always delivers on both. \n",
      "I started out 300lbs and began steadily losing weight until I got to around 230lbs, then i plateaued.  I wanted something that was not a thermogenic in order to get passed the plateau so I found this product after using their BCAA Energy (10/10) and began to see the effects of it immediately.  I was able to bust through that plateau and lose another 30lbs with the assistance of CLA1000.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to lose any amount of weight.\n",
      "Such a great product. No negative side effects whatsoever. Burns the fat and does what it says it does. As simple as that. \n",
      "Fantastic product, definitely noticed the difference while using it. I had been really cut previous to using it but could never get the last two abs to come in, finally did while using this! Would highly recommend \n",
      "This is a wonderful product.  For me, it helps boost my fat loss goals without jitters or any side effects.  I use this along with other EVL Nutrition products for both muscle gaining and cutting cycles.\n",
      "I love this CLA. I use it and L-Carnitine before bed. It is a great non stimulant weight loss support product. It helps to break down stored fat but not the muscle I am working so hard to gain. Paired with proper nutrition, it is a valuable tool in my arsenal and I will continue to use it for a very long time! \n",
      "I have been using this product for a while now. Along with my weightlifting program and healthy diet, this product has helped me with clearer definition. I like taking this before my workouts in combination with l-carnitine to give my workouts a little boost. It isn't \"magic\" but is a wonderful addition to hard work and training!\n",
      "After using this product for 4 months, I'd say it works pretty well.  I've lost about 30 lbs so far with this and an exercise routine.  It's hard to pinpoint if my weight loss was caused by this product or not but I do believe it helped accelerate my fat loss.\n",
      "Took this product to help with fat loss. Did not see any real difference than when I cut before not using anything. Might have helped might not have. \n",
      "Awesome product. Has really helped me cut some excess fat \n",
      "I love this product. I have been using it since July with a weight lifting program, as well as a great diet. Never in my life have I had such great results in terms of showing so much more definition. It's not a magic pill. If you aren't putting in the work, you probably won't see the results. Going forward, I will won't go without these CLA's especially while I prepare for my first competition. Thanks! \n",
      "I used this product during my first contest prep and received amazing results. Easy on the stomach and great results! I live by EVL products. Definitely would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "I have noticed absolutely nothing.  I'm following the directions but I am still gaining weight.\n",
      "It does something.. not as amazing as I thought. It won't work if you miss a week, so stick to it.\n",
      "Great product. Recently started using it and I've noticed my bodyfat dropping. Currently using it with Leanmode and hoping to add Trans4orm to my stack. I would recommend it. \n",
      "Love this product and definitely seeing results. I will definitely recommend to others and purchase again for myself.\n",
      "Great product! Will get more!\n",
      "Have been using this for about three weeks now. Don't know if I see numbers lost on the scale yet.. but I feel it in my stomach. Way less bloat and definitely feeling leaner. Would absolutely recommend this because it doesn't give me the \"I'm drinking all my water just to lose it\" feeling.. if you know what I mean. \n",
      "I've been taking this product for about a month now. From what I've seen, THIS IS NOT A FAT BURNER. Don't buy this product if you're looking to lose weight unless you incorporate cardio and dieting. Since I started using this product, I've gained weight, about 4 lbs now. I've always had a consistent weight and it never fluctuates until I've taken this product. I'm not sure if my muscle is deciding to grow/stay or it's just making me gain weight. (The product says lean muscle development, that could be happening.) My appetite has not changed at all, I still eat just like I did before I started taking the product. Again, this is not intended to be a fat burner. Fat burners allow you to sit around while a pill curves your appetite, this will not. You must workout and incorporate cardio for it to be fully effective. I still have another bottle for another month and will write another review when I finish that one, overall Evlution nutrition is a good supplement and I will buy them again, maybe different products.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've experienced good results with this product as part of my overall smart cutting program while maintaining muscle and performance. Moreover, it's a good value. I will favorably consider repurchasing this product in the future.\n",
      "This is what it says it is. CLA is a great substance to incorporate into any stack while cutting. I have used CLA from GNC and this CLA, and the price point of the EVL CLA1000 definitely makes it a better option. I will be purchasing it again for my next prep!\n",
      "I guess it's doing what it claims. I can't tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can't say if it is working or not yet because it may be too soon, but it goes down easily and that is the main thing I want to say in this review. Will add more when I see results.\n",
      "This is by far the best CLA on the market. Great price and from a trusted and reputable brand. EVL is the best in the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still testing this item. On y first bottle and lost a couple pounds but it came right back. maybe it needs a little more time to lick in. I am also watching my diet and doing cardio.\n",
      "I could not be happier with my purchase! I ordered this product because it was a great price and it was buy one, get one free! I got two bottles for $22 (Including shipping). I received my order the NEXT DAY! I started taking them (one with breakfast, lunch and dinner) five days ago and am already seeing the results! I have been on a pretty strict diet and exercise routine for the last six months and lost almost 60 pounds but have been struggling to see further results after about the fifth month. Like I said, I started taking this product FIVE days ago and have lost 4 pounds along with diet and exercise! For the past month I had hit a plateau and didn't think I was ready to give up trying. i tried this product and I'm so glad I did! I will definitely be reordering! Not only have I lost those extra pesky pounds, I'm beginning to see muscle definition in my abdomen! This product deserves 10 stars!\n",
      "This is the first time i have used a fat burnner cause most of them have stimulants but this product does not have any stimulant  is why i bought it, i have loss body fat which my waist size was almost at 36\" now im at 33\" doing the right diet and workikg out and the best of all i have not loss weight only body fat one side it effect i felt was sweating alot all day even when i was in bed with the ac on but i got used to it. \n",
      "Worked great! I'll definitely use this again. \n",
      "Great CLA. I use with a proper diet and exercise and i have noticed a big reduction in my stomach. I recommend this product\n",
      "Good quality and price.  Been on it religiously for 2 months and works well with managing weight.  I stack it with BCAA's, and fish oil.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No burps. Helps me slowly shed and keep off a couple extra pounds. Does what it is supposed to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do like this product. I had read things about CLA and wanted to try it for awhile, so I grabbed this while it was on sale. I have an aversion to pills, but these go down easily (aren't horse pills) and have a pleasant taste. I do feel like I've had less food cravings. I'm on a bulk round and it does seem like I'm gaining less belly fat this round and more muscle. I am eager to see what difference it makes when I start cutting. I will use until my supply runs out, and would most likely purchase again. \n",
      "This is my first fat burner supplement I've taken but feel like ive noticed a difference and have lost about a pound a day. I will definitely be buying this again.\n",
      "Great CLA supp.  Hits my requirements with no funny after taste or burps.  Great get when it's a BOGO!\n",
      "I have a clean diet and I'm in my calorie range I did not see any results from this product\n",
      "take it as directed and its been a month, definitely slimmed down without the feel of jitter or being awake at night due to stimulants and caffeine. Makes it nearly a natural process along with working out and dieting. \n",
      "This is the best CLA I have ever taken I highly recommend giving it a shot if you want to lose fat! \n",
      "I love these look like fish oil lol they do help you burn fat i noticed results in as little as 2 weeks i take mine when i remember your supposed to take 1 capsule with meals 3 times a day. No jitters a plus \n",
      "This is a great product. ..mixed with a well balanced diet and a great work out regimen.  I would recommend this product to anyone 😄\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Use with Leanmode and Transform for best results. CLA is a key get lose ingredient.\n",
      "i have to say this is the first time using a CLA product and evolution nutrition cla is just amazing . it does work for me and since i bought 3 bottles i have plenty for now but i will definitely buy this again .... you guys are awesome\n",
      "I really enjoy this product. I have been using this for about 8 weeks now and I feel you have to use a product at least a month to notice a difference and this one does what is says. \n",
      "After trying this product from 6/19/2015 til now I have went from 144lbs to my current weight 139 6/29/2015 last weigh in. I've been consistent with proper dieting and exercise, adding this was just the edge that I needed. I would highly recommend this product.\n",
      "I been taking CLA 1000 for a couple months now and definatley see results! I have seen better definition in my mid section and more cuts in my shoulders and arms while still maintaining my weight. I also started taking it with the EVL Leanmode. I am 44 yrs old and this has really helped me get to that next level I wanted to be at for summer. I recommend this to anyone!\n",
      "best product i ever tried\n",
      "It help me loose weight. i went from 210 lbs to 192lbs in 3 week\n",
      "don't just wait for the miracle you GOT TO WORK OUT TOO\n",
      "#CLAis#1\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first fat burner that I have tried and so far it is amazing! I have dropped 6 lbs since I started taking 10 days ago. CLA 1000  + Diet + Exercise = Success!!\n",
      "I finished my 1st bottle, took me 1 month. I end up go down from size 8 to size 6, my waist go down from 32 inch to 28 inch, my body fat down from 29.2% to 27.1% and I gained 2 pounds in total. I don't know if it's because of the CLA or just because of my training and clean eating, but my result is way more better than my friend who doesn't use it. So, maybe you could give it a try.\n",
      "Seems to be working well\n",
      "I've tried a lot of different products and I've seen the most progress from this CLA. I used this all through my prep for my first show, and I noticed a difference within the first week! All their products are amazing! \n",
      "I am still using this product on my first major cut, I have noticed significant fat loss but would not give full credit to this product. I am using this product with meals and performing cardio daily for 18 minutes prior to my work out ( 90 minutes) daily.\n",
      "I have used EVL CLA-1000 for the past 10 weeks on my two bikini competition preps, and I fully believe it has greatly contributed to my fat loss. I decreased my body fat from ~17% to now ~11% in that time frame and took no other fat loss supplements other than CLA and L-Carn. CLA1000 is an awesome product!\n",
      "This product is represents fat loss support and I think its done just that. The product is great because you have to take 3 per day with meals and the best part is that you don't have to take it at a certain time every day 30 minutes before a meal or something!!  Along with a good diet, I think this product rates one of the best because it's pretty cheap and supports good fat-loss.\n",
      "Amazing product. Really helped assist with weight loss. I felt in my opinion it helped with my mood and controlled my eating habits, helped me binge less and helped with eating less late at night. \n",
      "This product is pretty good, seems to take a week to kick in but after that it works. Before taking this I was losing half a pound a week. Without changing diet or exercise routines I'm now dropping a pound a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been trying to trim a little layer of stubborn fat for months. Cardio everyday before I lift. A great diet. Even tried thermos. Nothing was working real great. This cla has helped me cut what I've been trying so hard to work on. Wish I tried it earlier. It really is a great product. \n",
      "So far taking this I see no difference while I have only been taking it for about a week maybe that's why so to be fair I will give it more time and will reevaluate after I have finished a bottle but as of right now I can only give it a 3. \n",
      "My metabolism went 0-100 real quick. This product exceeded my expectations from a CLA product; I've used a few different brands in the past and they did as expected of course. This CLA product went above and beyond, I'm not sure if there is a potency or level of effectiveness for each brand but I will definitely be sticking with this one. \n",

      "This product helps me control my weigh and loss some lbs as I keep hitting the gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well I recently started to use this product for the past month. With my diet being in check, I believe it has really helped with dropping fat. I am really happy and will continue using this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just ordered this product and i am wondering when the best time it I'd to take it for best results, before/after breakfast? Before/after lunch ? \n",
      "It was buy one get one, so I got an excellent deal on this fine product. Been using these for 2 weeks now and I'm down about 10lbs in my cut. So I'm a happy camper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently purchased this product and I used it twice yesterday once during lunch and once during dinner. This morning I woke up and I'm not even bloated. Ate a heavy dinner last night around 9ish which is late for me. So this actually helped a lot I'll definitely make another review after I'm done the bottle but for sure better then the other cla forgot the name. But hands down best cla I've tried so far. \n",
      "Started taking it 4 weeks ago along with a fat burner.  I cut down 5 pounds off my weight and trimmed off 4% body fat.  I eat a poor diet, 2 big meals instead of 6 smaller ones.  If I can get those results without trying, it's gotta be good!\n",
      "Best CLA I use !\n",
      "Great product to get in the needed Conjugated Linoleic Acid for increased metabolic rate, and enhanced muscle growth. If you're a competitive athlete this is a Must have to help cut for the Stage...\n",
      "Solids CLA with all the ingredients you need to burn the fat your looking too loose I been taking CLA for a while and this seems to be one of my favs\n",
      "This product is great! I am and exercise and movement science major and if you have any background in physiology you know that Creatine is a supplement that actually works if you can store more PCr. This product is just a simple Monohydrate which is exactly what you need if supplementing Creatine. I am telling you this is exactly what you need if wanting to help aid your Phosphogen system and get more explosive with your lifts, in turn increasing strength and lean muscle mass. I haven't even got to the best part! EVL products seem to always have a special and are already at a great price! You looking for Creatine? This is it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is more of a muscle toner. It works great and I would buy it again. It is definitely a good purchase if you are considering!\n",
      "This was the first test boosting produst ive ever used, and i was happy with it. The deep sleep helped alot with my recovery. I would wake up at 4am already pumped up ready to go. Increase in strength, increases fat loss. All around great product. I do recomend time inbetween bottles. I took two months in a row. Not much happened the second month, but the first was great.\n",
      "My first time using a test booster and evltest did not dissapoint. After taking regularly as instructed it helped increase the amount of weight I was able to do in every kind of lift. A product I'd definitely recommend trying out for anyone looking for that extra push.\n",
      "On my second bottle and definitely feel firmer and have more energy plus the sleep support has been great.  Another quality product from EVL.  The only minor thing is the size and smell of the pills; however, the results by far outweigh it! Very solid product!\n",
      "Just finished my 2nd bottle and super impressed have gotten better sleep, has helped put sized on I've recommended this product and brand to all my friends \n",
      "I noticed less fatigue and better sleep while using EVLTest for a few months. No ill side effects were observed. Wouldn't hesitate to use this product again. \n",
      "As far as test booster go this one is unique as it has a full clinical does of d-aspartic acid that's been proven to increase free test levels. I like how they have dim (anti aromatose) most t booster lack that side of the coin. It does have one non test boosting ingredient (tribulous) but it does however improve your mood so I don't mind it being in the mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it's a good product that will increase your energy, performance, and mood.\n",
      "Great sleep at night. Feel better during the day. And I feel like I can push more weight at the gym.\n",
      "This product is great! I feel like a whole new person. It has really helped with vascularity as well as how much strength gains I've had. This product helps me push myself in order to maximize success\n",
      "Been a little over a month since I started taking this test booster/sleep aid, I can say it definitely works. \n",
      "Great value at the price. DAA is one of the best ingredients for size and strength, and it is in the required 3,120 mg dosage required for efficacy. The pills are on the larger size, but that's required given the amount that is packed into them. Results wise I was pleased. Was out of the gym for a while and this was my test booster of choice to get me back to my previous performance level, and it definitely helped.\n",
      "I have been taking this product over a week and I haven't seen any changes at all. My sleep is the same, my workouts are the same. Waste of money\n",
      "This is simply THE best test booster on the market. When I have tried others, they have failed and I always come back to EVL TEST. I get the boost and pumps in my training sessions and recovery is sped up tremendously! This product is the real deal when it comes to maximizing my efforts in and out of the gym.\n",
      "I have tried multiple natural test products. Its a little hard to tell how good that side of the equation is working because it's far from the very noticeable increases from injecting test. However, I have noticed an (albeit more subtle) boost from this one, more than force factor. The biggest reason i like it is i sleep really well and feel rested even when i get to bed too late. This is almost better than having high test levels because most of our muscle growth happens during sleep. Poor sIeep=poor growth. I don't think you will be disappointed unless you are expecting to feel like a wild beast. 😄\n",
      "Evl test is the best test booster I have used. Gives me good Everglades and a boost in confidence. My results in the gym have been much better using this product. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Great product , I can already tell the difference , more energy , better gain at the gym and better sleep,shorter recovery time. it's fast acting !\n",
      "I like the fact that it has the clinical dosage of D aspartic acid , in addition to the funegreek I also like that it has the DIM which helps control the estrogen level !great value for the money \n",
      "Definitely recommend this product!\n",
      "Im 44 year old male. I have been in and around the gym and supplements for 16yrs. I bought 2 bottles of this stuff because of the sale. Im 3 weeks into this stuff and im not happy. I actually sleep less because this product dries me up and i have to drink more water then normal. So im up to pee 3-4 times a night. So I have slept less in the 3 weeks. I also feel my mood has changed. Im not my normal self. People have noticed  I have a shorter temperament. And im not getting any results that i wanted in the gym. I actually feel weaker!!! And less excited about gym, diet and people in general.  Im better off not taking anything.  My blood work before taking evltest shows all my number ok. But testosterone was at under 300 so I thought it might be good to take this stuff. All in all i had to give this stuff a thumbs down. I hope i can return the unopened bottle back to Bb.com. My head hurts and feels like a cloud has moved in. Weird but thats my experience. And to add, my wieght scale the bodyfat % went up by 3. Totally not acceptable since my diet remained the same and i actually did more cardio this last 3 weeks.\n",
      "Great sleep and great pumps. Have taken this twice\n",
      "Wonderful product! Works great when combined with other EVL products! The sleep balance I get along with the edge I get in the gym is tremendous!\n",
      "Incredible supplement. I've used a few test boosters before and this is by far the best. Improved workouts along with better sleep. Definitely worth a buy. \n",
      "Decent change but had to do two months in a row to see a difference pills aren't very fun but worth in it the end! \n",
      "I bought this product due to the ratings, and reviews from Amazon and Bodybuilding.com. I took the product as recommended, which is 4 tablets before bed. I did notice over time that my sleep was very solid, even with me working rotating shifts and sometimes having to sleep during the day. Along with a consistently working out, and a pretty good diet, this product gave me a leaner, more muscular look. I was getting compliments from a lot of folks! I took it for 12 weeks, and am planning on doing another 12 weeks in a few months. \n",
      "A week or so into taking, my sleep was much better and my recovery time was shorter so I got better workouts in. My energy levels were also noticeably better as well during my workouts.    I would recommend this product as a part of your supplementation. \n",
      "Have tried other test boosters but this company excels far greater than the rest. Would recommend. \n",
      "Just like every other EVL product, I swear by EVLTest. Tried other brands before being introduced to this test, and won't go back to anything else. \n",
      "to me it was weird that the servings had to come before bed however i would wake up feeling well rested with barely any sleep. i started noticing my muscles were getting a lot more solid and id get a really insane pump during workouts. Always been a huge fan of EVL Nutrition, EVLTEST doesnt disappoint. \n",
      "Very happy with this product. another great product from Evl nutrition. Have been sleeping great and feel rested in morning. Also have noticed alittle more push when  working out, .  \n",
      "Loved this product!! Thought it would be difficult taking 4 pills nightly, but its really not. Sleeping much better at night and feeling stronger in the gym!! \n",
      "No noticeable gains, stamina or strength improvement. No difference in the bedroom either. Going back to ZMA. \n",
      "This is one of the better T-boosters that I've had, and the price seems reasonable. The only reason I did not give it a higher rating is because they added ZMA. I would prefer to have that left out since ZMA is best taken before bed, and I like to have my T-booster about an hour or so before I workout. So, instead of following their instructions of taking all 4 pills at once. I take two before bed and two before I workout.\n",

      "I've used this before and like it because I notice a change in my sleep and strength in the gym. It actually helps you get into a deeper sleep which will recover muscle faster. I'd recommend trying this product out for sure, it does dehydrate you more so be sure to drink twice as much water. Add this to your stack and you will see improvements!\n",
      "I have been taking EVL test for a little under two months and it has been a great experience. I have never really taken a test booster before until coming across the makeup of EVL's product. I can 100% honestly say that my recovery process has been sped up and my sleep has been 2nd to none. I highly recommend taking this product to anyone who is looking for a quality but inexpensive product.\n",
      "This product combines two supps that I was previously taking, ZMA+testBoost=Muscle. I was taking a testBooster during the day and a ZMA at night but didn't seem to be getting good results. My gains have increased after about a month of taking EVLtest but the biggest improvement is my quality of sleep had improved after a few weeks of taking EVLTEST. Finally a testBooster that really works!\n",
      "Amazing product, recovery and strength has been out of this world! \n",
      "Excellent product. I have noticed better sleep quality, recovery, and improved stamina in the gym. I have noticed with 1 bottle that I have lost some of the stubborn fat I've been holding and noticed improved definition and little bit of size with no real changes to diet or workout frequency. I will continue to use this product in the future.\n",
      "I see results everyday!  I've tried several products, but this this most impressive one yet!  There's an added bonus of an intense vascular pump soon after taking the daily dose.  There's no digestive issues for me either.  I feel I'm definitely getting great value out of this product!\n",
      "Great product. Loved the results I got after a few weeks. More strength and energy. Better sleep and felt less stressed out. \n",
      "Seems to work well.  I noticed more energy and good recovery for the two weeks I was on it.  Then I went on vacation and took a break.  I'll start back up next week.  What I dislike is that these are really big pills.\n",
      "Good solid product like alot from evl. Heavy does of DA and great sleep. Only bad part is there horse pills but its worth it for the gains. Start second bottle in 2 weeks\n",
      "Not sure about this product yet.  The first week or so seemed to help level out my mood but gave a headache most of the day.  After a week headaches went away but not noticing mood stabilizing anymore. Haven't noticed much in the gym either but I haven't finished first bottle and still have one more so will update if I start to notice any improvements.\n",
      "Tried this for 30 days and noticed improvement in recovery and aggression. Pretty good price as DAA products are generally more expensive, and it's combined with a good amount of other testosterone support agents. I prefer the pill form to powder as the DAA doesn't taste good. Didn't notice any major side effects. I like the added magnesium and zinc.  I will definitely buy again. \n",
      "Will this show in an urinalysis?\n",
      "I've been using this product for a little over the 4 week mark now. I've been experiencing significant improvements in my lifts; I've set a new PR on nearly every exercise in the past month, though I would not attribute this completely to the introduction of this product. My diet and workout plan has also changed in the past month which I'm sure has a lot to do with it. However, something that I have always struggled with is sleep and I can say that I have been sleeping much better lately; something I CAN attribute to the start of taking this product. Very deep sleep and great recovery, plus a bonus is that dreams have been extra vivid. So far, no unwanted side effects. Great product.\n",
      "Purchased this product on a buy 1 get 1 seeing it was so highly rated (rating now seem suspiciously exaggerated after deeper review).  The product does help with overnight sleep just enough to help most nights.  I can honestly say if its working, its doing so silently as i am not keenly aware of any changes to my stamina, energy, physic, recovery, added lifting ability and so on.  This is not to say something isn't occurring, its just not the \"boost\" described by other and the marketing.  Some of the cons are the pills are actually huge, for most, swallowing pills this size is a problem and it does overwhelm you preparing to take the 4 pill per night dosage.   In addition, the pills have a very strong very unpleasant odor.  You have to open the bottle, take the 4 out as fast as possible, close the bottle and not breathe while taking them kind of odor.... its bad and leaves your hands, mouth, and breath tasting and smelling equally offensive.  I'm almost done with the first bottle and will finish the 2nd since i paid for them... i will look for an alternative on for my next purchase.\n",
      "I've taken two other boosters and this is by far my favorite one. I'm in pharmacy, and when I am I do not sleep well. This? I will get a solid eight hours no problem. I also along with diet and exercise gained the most size and strength from any supplement thus far. I got up to 275 on incline bench for three reps. Overall the most solid product with no noticeable side effects I've tried.\n",
      "I've been taking this for about 2 months now, I never taken any test booster before, but I noticed a little improvement in my overall physical activity, well being, a little increase in strength and better recovery. \n",
      "Don't expect a huge difference, this is not steroid...\n",
      "But if you're looking for a natural and good price test booster, I highly recommend this one.\n",
      "Great product. Definitely get a good and deep sleep. Feel more energized and stronger in the gym. Will continue to take this product as suggested. Best test booster I've every tried.\n",
      "Great product, good results! Highly recommended!\n",
      "About 2 weeks in and feel really rested every morning and test levels and strength on the way up as well\n",
      "Great product. Works as described. Highly recommended and priced right. \n",
      "Compared to the other brand I took before, this one gives me hard time sleeping, waking up at night and dreaming a lot. But those do not matter, what matters is the size of the pill. It is way too big. Bad experience taking this product.\n",
      "This product is fantastic. I get better rest and recover faster. I bought it unsure what to expect and I was more then please. I'm definitely going to be buying it again!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I just started taking it before sleep and I can feel my muscles harder, better recovery and I can sleep a way better too. I was looking for improve my testosterone level and my recovery. EVL Test surprised my expectations.\n",
      "If you want a product that really gives some good test boosting results then try EVL test I really felt like I gained off this more then any other test boosters I’ve had in the past. \n",
      "I have been religiously taking this product for 45 days and honestly have noticed zero difference.  I am 28 year old male, so i am uncertain if my Testosterone has dropped low enough to notice any benefits this product may have provided.\n",
      "I take EVL Test every night about an hour before bed. You really notice a difference after a few days pass with your sleep cycles. I don't dream much on it, and seem to have a deep sleep. It's very noticeable when you are back off of it. If you want good sleep cycles and an increased drive, buy this product, it does exactly what it says. \n",
      "A great product all around better sleep witch naturally means better recovery. A definite increase in strength and stamina. Will for sure continue to buy it.\n",
      "Another excellent product!! I get great sleep, which leads to better recovery and even better workouts each day. Since I started using EVL Test , almost every workout has been better than the last. I am either able to lift heavier weights or go for extra reps!  Love it!!!\n",
      "Great product , makes all the difference in performance and recovery times . Extra edge needed for day in and day out intensive workouts. It took me a while to find a good test booster and finally did! \n",
      "\n",
      "Good product! I love that they show you exactly how much of everything is in it. I've been taking it for 2 months now and have notice a significant difference in my energy & stamina levels. This product feels a lot \"cleaner\" then other test boosters I've taken (no weird side effects for me). \n",
      "About 10 days in on the first bottle. I am 40 and new to test boosters as a disclaimer. I noticed after the 2nd day I was getting better sleep at night and feeling more refreshed when I got up in the morning. I work nights and hit the gym after work which makes it kinda hard to get to bed at a reasonable hour usually. This product helps quite a bit with that. just beginning to feel the effects on testosterone at the gym and so far no complaints. Have more energy at the gym and I've gotten thru a couple of plateaus.  \n",
      "About half way through my cycle and I can already tell improvement in my lifts and daily habits! I've started eating healthier as well which is also important. At first I was skeptical about what test booster to order but I found this one and glad I did. I love this stuff! \n",
      "this test booster provides the best of everything. With DAA fenugreek and tribulus. I have noticed good strength gains and a new found energy to lift every second of every day.\n",
      "This has been another quality product from EVL. I just finished my first bottle of it, and I have definitely noticed a difference. It has noticably helped my recovery. I definitely have more energy and intensity for my workouts, and I have way more restful sleep when I take this right before bed. Overall this is a very solid product.\n",
      "Great test support product, really happy with this product after continued use. Better sleep, better workouts, better recovery, across the board this product really helps. Great natural product with no side effects whatsoever. I will def continue using this product. \n",
      "The only thing I noticed with this product is slightly better sleep. Other than that I did not notice any chances in stamina/strength. Will not purchase again. 2 for not getting my money's worth.\n",
      "I got two bottles of this and am just about done with the first.  I've been taking 4 pills a night shortly before bed as directed.  I havn't noticed anything in how I feel, recovery, or sleep.  I just noticed my urine is much yellower in the morning similar to what a multi vitamin would do.  i can't say I would recommend this as results (even if unnoticed results) haven't been worth the money.\n",
      "I purchased this product because it has DAA, Fenugreek AND Tribulus along with the active ingredients in ZMA as opposed to most T boosters that only have one of the T boosting ingredients. After letting the supp build in my system for a few days, I noticed that I did NOT get fatigued in the gym. The only complaint I have is that because of not being fatigued, I felt that I didn't work hard enough! Will definitely be buying this again!\n",
      "Been taking this for about a month now, take 4 pills before bed and within 30mins i am knocked out. I wake up feeling good (good enough for a 4AM wake up for the gym, not a day-shift type of person). I have noticed my recovery time has decreased a lot. I do not feel as sore as i used to be the day after. i am definitely liking the results of taking the product. i will buy this again in the future!!!!!\n",
      " \n",
      "This test booster helped me a lot! I was plateauing at 160 pounds and now I weigh 170!! I've been eating healthy and taking a mass gainer. Also a cellucor casein. Got a deep sleep and made me happier at work! Loved it! Highly suggested\n",
      "I'm 44 and I gotta say this stuff works great! Great booster! I do notice increased strength, more energy in the gym during workouts, better sleep for sure, and muscle hardness.    \n",
      "Not big on test boosters but when I saw this one I jumped on it right away. Good deal on a good product. Seems to be working well so far, I only been on it for a week and feel it a little bit already! \n",
      "Good test booster helps me sleep and feel well rested in the morning. I noticed some more stamina as well.\n",
      "Noticed better/deeper sleep and more strength over a few weeks of taking. I will get more when I can cycle again. \n",
      "Truely one of the best test boosters out there!\n",
      "\n",
      "EVLTEST Will not only help you reach rem sleep but it will keep you there! Reaching a deep sleep will help you boost your recovery and test.  Make sure you start with a lower dose and allow at least 7-8 hours of sleep on your first night!\n",
      "Love this product ! Took as directed and worked very well. My sleep recovery and strength all improved. Would definitely recommend it to friends and will be purchasing again\n",
      "Sound sleep, otherwise useless for me. Tried it for a month. \n",
      "Also tried transform which was also useless.\n",
      "Beware\n",
      "Looks like most of their products have inflated reviews.\n",
      "I have only been taking this supplement for 5 days, so I haven't seen any desired results yet.\n",
      "However, a side affect I am not enjoying are the headaches that wake me up in the middle of the night. Not sure what that is about.\n",
      "The other initial problem I have with this is the SIZE OF THE FRICKIN PILLS!! These things are huuuuge.  What the heck.  Make them smaller and up the serving size to 6 if necessary.  I have to cut these horse pills in half.\n",
      "Taking 4 pills prior to going to sleep is not working for me for the above reasons, so I am going to try 2 in the morning and 2 before bed.\n",
      "I have 2 bottles to get through and will update my review when I am finished.\n",
      "Update:  I could not get through the first bottle of this stuff, the headaches at night were not worth whatever effect I was going to get from this supplement...if any.  For me, this was a waste of money.\n",
      "ok this one is tricky cuz i just started them this week i will give a better review in 2 weeks for the total effect but the cons of this product is the size of the pills crazy big and you got to take 4 of them they are hard to take and swallow but if they work then it will be worth it...also the smell of them pills isnt so good....this review for now is only for the size of pills and smell...for effects review to come soon\n",
      "This product has given me exactly what I'd says it will!! The recovery is amazing and I continue to grow through my preps!!\n",
      "EVL nutrition has yet again created a top of the line product for an affordable price. While researching natural test boosters, I noticed that most of them only utilize 1 or 2 of the key ingredients for natural test support. However, EVL test arms you with all of the necessary vitamins and minerals while utilizing D-Aspartic Acid, tribulus terrestrial, fenugreek, and diinolylmethane. All at a price that won't leave your wallet empty.\n",
      "Very good product. A goal of mine was to bench 300lbs and just hit it using this product. After two weeks of use I could tell my strength increased and stamina. Almost done with a months supply anxious to see if I can surpass 300lbs. \n",
      "I tried this for about a month.\n",
      "the good only once daily at night up to one hour before sleep, it did make my days more energized for most part and no side effects to say.\n",
      "the bad is they pills smell like curry to me and they are pretty large\n",
      " Noticed increase in my strength, stamina within 5 days. All i needed. \n",
      "Noticed a difference in stamina and strength within 5-7 days. Have used for two months. I would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "EVLTEST is the best testosterone booster I have tried. Increased muscle mass and strength since I began my diet and exercise program while supplementing with EVLTEST.\n",
      "I have tried numerous Testosterone products and none have come close to the effects that I have seen since being on this one.  I just finished my second bottle and have seen a noticeable increase in my PRs and overall tightness in my muscle building.  I am 46 years old and in the best shape of my life.  I look forward to the continued use of this product.\n",
      "For the price this is a T-booster that cant be beat.  the only t-boosters ive ever taken that i've felt better effects from have all cost $70+ per bottle.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for t boost and you're not rollin with baller money definitely get EVL TEST!\n",
      "\n",
      "You need the boost \n",
      "This helped me create more muscle mass and strength it also really contributed to a healthy nights sleep.  Good product\n",
      "Hands down the best natural test booster i've ever used. Has nearly everything you could ask for in it. DAA, ZMA, vitamin D, DIM, tribulus, etc. Make sure you take it right before bed for best results!\n",
      "I'm on my second bottle of EVLTest so obviously I do believe it works. My sleep has been much better and I wake up with more energy. I do still wake up pretty groggy, have a hard time getting ramped up for the day, and my daily energy is still low so I've given this an 8 out of 10. As I continue to take it and if I see improvements I'll definitely be changing that to a 9 or perhaps a 10. Definitely worth a shot if you have issues sleeping!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't notice anything after taking it, but it may be an unfair review as I never feel anything from natural test supplements. I think they are all a scam.\n",
      "Wow freaking awesome my work outs don't stop sleep like a baby and recover faster than wolverine feel like I can't be touched. \n",
      "\n",
      "So far so good realy like. These product I will buy it againg\n",
      "I love it, right now I'm getting prepped for my first bodybuilding show and I have some pretty intense workouts. I workout later, around 7 or 8 pm and end up pretty sore when I go to bed. But since I started taking it I wake up rested and pretty much fully recovered to the point where I could go again in the morning! I've had some other nighttime formulas and this was by far the best one. It's an awesome formula and I would definitely recommend it.\n",
      "This product has been fantastic for keeping on task over the last couple of months. With a busy schedule, that starts before the sun rises, and ends after it sets, FocusMode makes a noticeable difference in mental clarity and mood. On morning lift days it's helped add a few more reps in my sets and keeps me more in tune with everything around me the rest of the day. Definitely a product for anyone who exercises or has a hectic schedule. \n",
      "Good product. I'm a bigger person an didn't feel much when I took it. I upped the dosage to 3 pills an day slowly noticed something. For other people I'd say it would work a lot better then it did for me. \n",
      "Great product.  Being a line cook, you need to concentrate and multi task.  This product gives me energy and focus.  It does what it says, it raises my alertness, focus, and memory.  I would definitely recommend this product not only to weight lifters, but to anyone.  Another great product from EVL NUTRITION!!\n",
      "I found this product to not do anything for me.\n",
      "Fantastic product! Enhances focus and drive during the day. \n",
      "Focus mode is a must if your foggy in the morning. Definitely helps me at work, I'm a flat rate auto tech and this gives me alertness and focus I need. Been taking it off and on for the last 2 months. I can tell a difference when I don't and do take it before work. Will buy again when I'm all out. Gives you a clean and stable feel, no crash or sudden energy rush, very consistent feel.\n",
      "I have got to say this is probably one of my favorite supplements of all time. I am a college student and I was laking concentration and focus in the classroom, so I decided to purchase this product in hopes that it would give me a little edge. To my surprise it did exactly that. This product not only improve my concentration and focus, but it helped me with my memorization as well. My grades improved tremendously because of this product. Along with school, I also took this product before my workout to keep me focused. I believe because I was more focused in the gym my overall motivation increased as well. Overall great product. I definitely would recommend giving this product a try.\n",
      "This stuff does what it claims. Definite focus, improved mood and drive. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a mood support supplement. \n",
      "FocusMode does exactly what it says it will: provide energy and clarity throughout the day. It has definitely helped me improve my days.\n",
      "I love the focus mode. I wake up every morning take two pills, with a few scoops of bcaa energy and it definitely helps me get through my days. Ive been on it for about a week now and i have noticed that i am more alert and focused at work; great product! EVL definitely goes above and beyond with their products\n",
      "The blue razz is the only flavor I have tried and it is pretty good. The lean products are working very well leaving me not feeling hungry during the day.\n",
      "There's a reason you see \"great product\" and \"great company\" over and over again on EVL reviews, it's true. I've been dipping my proverbial toes into the supplementation pool for the last several months now, and have noticed very promising results thus far. Most days I've stack this in combination with the Lean Capsules and a whey powder. This combination with proper diet has allowed me to further lean out without losing muscle in the process. I can soundly recommend it to anyone trying to further or maintain a lean.\n",
      "This is my favorite powder during and post workout for protein synthesis. The fruit punch flavor is great. My wife thought it was a little on the sweet side but I love it and drink it at every workout. Definitely recommend this everyone!\n",
      "My new favorite BCAA. Keeps me going during my longer workouts and I always have some in the morning too to get my day going. Bonus great taste. Honestly I don't usually like fruit punch flavors but this one is seriously so good, not overwhelmingly sweet like most artificial fruit punch. I'm a big fan of their BCAA energy as well but I like the lean factor of this one. I love EVL and recommend people to their products all the time but especially I recommend trying this one. Mixes well, tastes so good, easy to drink, makes me feel good. I'll for sure be buying it again. \n",
      "This product is great. Both flavors taste awesome. And it definitely helps put with fat burning combined with cardio. And helps with recover on rest days with the awesome good ingredients that comes in it. Also its very easy to consume since it's a powder you can just through a scoop in your water and go!\n",
      "Great product! Flavor is great and definitely helps with endurance, recovery and metabolism. I also use EVL BCAA energy as well as EVL lean mode and all three products work well together. I usually take lean mode with the BCAA energy in the morning before my workout and drink LeanBCAA mid day. EVL products are top notch and have worked for me! The lean mode and lean BCAA have helped me to burn additional fat and now muscle definition is starting to show! Highly recommend!! \n",
      "Great product and absolutely an amazing company! I use almost their entire line of supplements and have never had the results like I have with these! Will be continuing to use this company and this product for the foreseeable future! Seriously, far and away the best company I've ever dealt with.\n",
      "I have switched all of my supps to EVL and the LeanBCAAS do not fail to impress. I take 1 serving during my workouts and it keeps my energy levels high. They can also be used as a substitute for energy drinks throughout the day if you need a little pick-me-up. Highly recommend!\n",
      "A while back I was out of my normal BCAA powders and looking for something new - as I was trying to lose some weight for the summer, I saw the LeanBCAA and was very interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a little skeptical about how this would taste, but I was really impressed! The flavor was great for both Blue Raspberry and Fruit Punch! Usually I only open one tub at a time, but I had both of these open at once and would change day-to-day depending on how I felt. I really liked both, but if I had to pick one I'd go with Fruit Punch - either way its good flavor without being TOO sweet. My biggest gripe with some BCAA products is that they are so sweet that it can bother my stomach during a hard workout, thats not a problem with LeanBCAA\n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely buy this again - one thing to remember is there is a serving of CLA. If you are using CLA already, this means you can take one less serving of the pills and make them last longer!\n",
      "\n",
      "So far I've used 6+ products from EVL and have never been let down - they even sent me an email a while back offering a free hat with proof of purchase,  which is  a cool bonus!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried a few other brands, and the flavor/price/addition of CLA make this a no-brainer. I got 2 of the new Muscletech BCAA and I felt this tasted better and was lighter on my stomach. Anything too sweet makes me sick to my stomach during a tough workout!\n",
      "I have recently been buying evlution products, pre workout,  bcaa energy and most recent bcaa lean.  All of them are great products but I am going to review the bcaa lean here.  First of all the fruit punch taste is very good.   But what sets this above other bcaa products is that it contains CLA and carnitine with enough MG if you were to buy separate.   So if you want a bcaa that contains fat burner along with your normal bcaa, I highly recommend this from evlution.   Also if you sign up at their website they have great customer service and promotions. \n",
      "I have tried both flavors of LeanBCAA and they are both very good.  If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the Blue Raz.  What separates this product from other BCAA products is that it contains carnitine and CLA.  When I am cutting, this is my go-to BCAA product because it helps with the fat burning process without all the added stimulants.  I always mix two scoops in about 20 ounces of water when I do my cardio sessions, which usually last for about 30-45 minutes.  Not only does it keep me hydrated, but I feel like it is working.  I also use it for when I do weight training.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a BCAA product with a little extra boost without the stimulants!\n",
      "This works well for longer training days.  It will help from feeling DOMS when taken on a regular basis.  Doesn't mix perfectly, but not difficult to drink. \n",
      "Flavor isn't bad but doesn't seem to mix well in water, I usually have little bits floating in mine that didn't dissolve even after letting it sit overnight in the fridge. \n",
      "The fruit punch flavor is much better then the blue raz. The taste of blue raz is too sweet and stays in my mouth for hours. Mixes fine with water.\n",
      "Oh my goodness. I've been looking for a good BCAA and this stuff blew my mind. Went up in weight within the first day of use. Had so much energy and stamina and the flavor is FREAKING PHENOMENALLLL. Will be buying again. 10/10 A++++\n",
      "Flavor was alright. But it was effective and got the job done.\n",
      "Love the taste. When i first tried this it was the unflavor version i mixed with juice. I hotnit as a gift now that i have fruit punch i love it even more.  I have seen result innone month of used. I would buy it again\n",
      "I purchased these BCAA's because I loved that it also contains L-Carnitine and CLA for added fat burning effects. I was scared to shy off my usual flavor of blue rasperry and obtained the fruit punch and to my surprise it was really good! It wasn't too strong, it was the perfect mix of flavoring. As far as performance goes, it definitely keeps me hydrated through my workouts! Will continue to stay with this product!\n",
      "Overall a pretty solid BCAA. It has the 2:1:1 ratio every good BCAA has, and I also really like the fact it has CLA mixed with the BCAA to help build lean mass. I had the fruit punch, which was not bad at all, the only knock I have on flavoring is personally to me it kind of tasted more like pink lemonade that fruit punch (but still a great flavor). Other than that I would highly reccomend this product. \n",
      "Love this product, one of the best bcaas on the market. It keeps my muscle mass with out adding a ton of calories or food. 💪🏼😎👍🏼 great product. Keep it up EVL!!!!  Love the Blue Raz! Great product been in my rotation for a while now!!!\n",
      "I have tried a few different BCAA supplements, but none deliver results like EVL's LeanBCAA. This product helps me sustain a high level of energy throughout my workout and helps my body recover faster after an intense workout. What differentiates this from most other BCAA's is its fat-burning properties. It has CLA and L-Carnitine in it which help to burn fat for fuel. Using LeanBCAA in conjunction with EVL LeanMode has helped me to lose the last few pounds and help tone my body overall. I look forward to trying EVL's BCAA Energy in the future as I have been impressed with all of the EVL products I have tried so far.\n",
      "Love this BCAA. It mixes well and contains the ideal 2:1:1 ratio. \n",
      "I originally purchased it because it contains Carnitine and CLA. \n",
      "Both flavors taste great and are not too sweet like other BCAA's I have tried. \n",
      "I recently bought this product. I've previously used EVL BCAA Energy, and i was happy with that, but after i used up my supply of that i wanted to try out another product as EVL has many different BCAA products. Since i'm trying to cut my weight i figured i'd try LEANBCAA. It's only been a couple of weeks but i haven't felt diminished in anyway, my body feels great after i hit the gym, and the morning after. The only thing i'm a little sad on is that I have EVL ENGN preworkout in the fruit punch flavor and i love the way that tastes, so i got fruit punch for LEANBCAA, but it doesn't taste quite as good, but hey that's just me, it's not bad in anyway tho.\n",
      "Love, love this product and so far everything I have tried from Evlution!!!have to say its my favorite BCAA. Good flavor. mixes well. I use it before my workouts. Great BCAA ratios and also has some fat burners in it! I recommend this product to anyone who is working out and trying to shred a few stubborn pounds! You won't be disappointed \n",
      "First off It tastes great. I take it during my workout and stack it it with ENGN pre-workout. They work great together, more pumps and less fatigue.  Totally recommend it.\n",
      "I decided to give EVL's lean BCAA a shot, compared to their BCAA Energy. I think the BCAA Energy is one of the best BCAA's out. For me, the Lean BCAA wasn't quite as good...taste is still pretty good and it's a little harder to mix then the BCAA Energy. However, it does it's job. It helps me sustain energy while working out and also helps me recover quickly. I haven't used it long enough to notice whether it's helping my weight loss or not. This is another very solid product from EVL!! \n",
      "First off, this stuff tastes great.  Easily the best tasting BCAAs I've ever had.  Helps fight off fatigue during intense workouts.  I also really like the addition of the fat-burning ingredients.  All in all, a great BCAA supplement.\n",
      "This is one of the better BCAAs I've bought. Not too sweet or too strong. Had a nice flavor and I've had a few friends try it out and they loved it as well. It gives me that extra boost when I want to give up. Leaves me feeling refreshed after a long workout and a long day of working outside. I highly recommend this, alongside other of EVLs products.  You won't be disappointed in your purchase.\n",
      "Lean BCAA is another quality product from EVL. The powder mixes well and tastes great! I like to sip on Lean BCAA throughout my workouts to get those BCAAs that my muscles need and also to burn some fat with the carnitine and CLA. I would definitely recommend that you try it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried both Blue Raz and Fruit Punch and they are both outstanding. The BCAA's help kick start the muscle recovery process. This also includes CLA's to help you burn fat in the process of rebuilding your muscles. Both flavors are absolutely amazing, but if I had to choose my favorite it would be Blue Raspberry.\n",
      "Also see review for the ENGN pre workout. They are almost identical in taste and texture. This is thick and heavy. It made me feel bloated and gave me a stomach ache. The taste was also really heavy and overly sweet IMO. I got it because of the other reviews but was super disappointed. I prefer BLOX silk aminos (fave) and then maybe Xtend - both in blue raspberry. Way better.\n",
      "Great BCAA powder! Mixes very easily and tastes good too. I usually take this mid workout to help me power through my workout . EVL products always highly recommended!\n",
      "Best bcaa , get you lean and give energy during workout, taste great too highly recommend this product\n",
      "MUST BUY! This is my new preferred BCAA to carry me through intense workouts and help rebuild muscle. I have been using this product for several weeks now and love the flavor, the ingredients, and the results  seeing from it. The l-carnitine and CLA matrix contained in this product also reduce the need to purchase additional supplements to target fat loss. Such a great product, from an amazing supplement company. Their products will be the only ones I purchase from here on out. \n",
      "This is my go to BCAA powder. I drink it during my workouts whether I'm lifting or doing conditioning and I feel like it definitely helps with hydration as well as endurance. It mixes really well and has a pretty good taste. Ive used almost all of EVL's products and haven't found one yet that I don't like. Great company that makes quality products. \n",
      "I have been using this product since last fall and really saw improvements in growth of muscle and recovery of muscles.  I really tried other products, however found them gritty and really couldn't stand the taste/flavors.  The blue raz is by far the best, goes down like cool aid--- minus the sugars!  I drink it approximately 5-6 days a week during my workouts.  I couldn't be happier with it and will continue using it and recommending it to others.  :)\n",
      "I have purchased THREE of these already!! I love them. The taste is amazing and I fee like the CLA and L-Carnatine are really helping my weight loss. I feel so much leaner! Muscles are popping up all over the place! This is my go to drink for my work out. \n",
      "Cant get over the fact that it taste like cough syrup. Buzz factor in the weak end of the spectrum but focus was good.\n",
      "I purchased these BCAA's because they also have L-Carnitine and CLA in them. I normally take both supplements in pill form.  I bought the fruit punch version. It mixes well and tastes great!  \n",
      "\n",
      "really was one of the better out there,seems,to work awesome\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the taste of the fruit punch. I feel it helps me recover a lot faster. Definitely buying again.\n",
      "This amino blend tastes pretty good. I can drink it regularly as a daily beverage. I got pretty decent energy and good results from aminos as far as recovery. Didn't see much upside on the fat loss though. \n",
      "Flavor was ok. I didn't see or feel much difference during workouts.\n",
      "Solid BCAA IMO. Mixes really easy, tastes great and not overly sweet. Also won't make you jittery with too much added caffeine, etc. \n",
      "Talk about a great product. This one tastes great and really works. This helps my energy levels and helps me recover so quickly! Will definitely buy this again\n",
      "I purchased the blue raz with expectations of it doing what it claimed however that did not happen.  It tastes great and that's all I am can say about it. \n",
      "This tastes really great! Not too sweet, I usually end up mixing it with 12 oz of water and filling the rest of my blender bottle with ice and it's still pretty sweet, but still very good.\n",
      "This is my first time trying LeanBCAA. Great taste, tried both blue raz and fruit punch. Gace me a little boost when I used it throughout the day. Felt like it helped cut while maintaining lean muscle mass. I am a big fan of evlution in general, but highly recommend this product if your looking for bcca's in addition to wanting to maintain lean muscle and cut fat.\n",
      "I'm a supplement junkie - love experimenting and trying new things. I was stoked when I saw this new product because I've never tried dedicated fat burners but liked the idea of throwing them in with my BCAAs. But this stuff does not dissolve. Not even a little bit. It's worse than bad quality creatine mono. It's sitting on my shelf, still full, because I don't even have the heart to give it to a friend, so I can't comment on results - but there's lots of products out that there that won't feel like grit in your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE IT. This is is the 2nd BCAA I've tried (the first was Best BCAA by BPI- also an amazing product) but I love that this one has L-Carnitine in it. The taste is great, it doesn't leave me bloated, and the powder is fine and easily dissolves. Will definitely buy again!\n",
      "I purchased this product after trying ENGN and BCAA energy by evlution nutrition.  I have been so happy with every product I've purchased from this company.  I've been on this for a week so I can't say I've seen any change in body fat yet, but in terms of endurance I feel so much better during and after my workouts.  I've been following the instructions and taking one scoop intra-workout and one scoop post.  I've tried PLENTY of BCAA supplements from other companies such as ON, cellucor, etc.  This is by far the best.  Be sure to give it a try.  \n",
      "Great product! I used to use BSN Amino X which was ok EVL definetly tastes a lot better and has far less Red #40. So far I love the results\n",
      "I was in the market for a new bcaa that would help in our weight loss journey and came across this. Hubs did all the research and said we should try it. and I'm so glad we did. I definitely feel more alert, my food cravings have subsided and so far it's been a great addition to my supplement stack. We have both flavors and the fruit punch is a little chalky, But that's my only negative. Although I do wish it came in more flavors like the pre workout. \n",
      "Tasted great and really gave me a noticeable and very helpful boost in my workouts! I've only had the fruit punch but it tastes amazing. Just ordered another one and plan to get another one...\n",
      "I was skeptical at first but taste is amazing and really gives you great energy, really helps me with energy during the day with a newborn in the house, really gives you those extra reps in the gym while training ,no joke best bcaa i have ever tried.\n",
      "I purchase both flavors and became a big fan of the Evl's bcaas!  I like how they have CLA and L-carnintine in mixed with the bcaas!\n",
      "Great taste!! If you want to burn fat and build lean muscle then definitely give it a try!! Love all the EVL products and this is just another great one!!!👍🏻👍🏻\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like EVL products, and their LenBCAA is no exception.  The flavour is great - it's almost like having a \"treat\" of some sort when you're trying to cut weight and being really strict with your diet.  Two thumbs up!\n",
      "Great Taste!  I use if for mid and post workout recoveries. \n",
      "This product has great flavor, and mixes well with or without a mixer.\n",
      "I am a huge fan of EVL's new product line! Especially the LeanBCAA. On January 15th I was 192. and on March 1 I was 175. I slightly changed my diet and adjusted my workout but I believe most of that weight loss was due to EVL LeanBCAA. Even today I still weight 175 but I can tell I'm still loosing body fat while increasing muscle mass. I have tons of people asking me if I'm loosing weight now, because it is that noticeable. I take one during my workout and then one after my workout everyday for max results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also see a few people complain about mixability. I have absolutely no problem with mixing. Even if you let the bottle sit for a few minutes it will dissolve on it's own. Do yourself a favor and take a chance on this great product!\n",
      "Lean BCAA Is an outstanding product.  I utilize it both during and after my workout to provide my body with both fat burning and muscle building ingredients with no filler or junk.  I've been using lean BCAA for the last three months on an extreme cut diet and have managed to lose fat while actually increasing my strength across the board. I highly suggest Lean BCAA to anyone looking to maintain muscle while cutting fat! \n",
      "This is a truly great product and my favorite from EVL.  Not only is it an awesome source of pure and balanced BCAAs but it has the added value of non-stimulant fat burners too!  The flavor for Blue Raz is awesome and I look forward to taking this both in my intra and post shakes.  All in all, its not only a great way to get your BCAAs but a great way to achieve all of your lifting goals.\n",
      "I take this along with my ENGN pre-workout and again post workout and I've noticed extra energy and a lot less soreness after my heavy lifting days will definitely continue with these BCAA's and the added weight loss dosent hurt either \n",
      "Great taste both fruit punch and blue raz. I use it as a intra-workout to help burn fat and turn it into energy to help my workouts. I also like to drink it throughout the day to give my water some flavor. Good solid product. \n",
      "Really enjoyed the blue raz flavor! I like the combination of two products, weight management with bcaa. Will keep this product in my stack year round!\n",
      "Think its would be as good as EVL-ENGN i bought both the flavours. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both has a chemical after taste, that is not good at all. Its sometimes have to get though a 15oz of water mixed with one scoop of LeanBCAA.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt its has CLA. I would suggest you to take CLA directly or in other form. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not recommend. \n",
      "I bought this in hopes that it would compare to NEON BCAA in Fruitpunch and it was a big disappointment. It had this cardboard/processed taste to it and I couldn't even manger to get through half the shaker. I love EVL products, this one just didn't meet the expectations :( \n",
      " Awesome taste  mixes really well will be buying again \n",
      "I think the EVL lean bcaa is a great product and having the cla & carnitine included is very convenient. The only negative is the mixability. I would definitely purchase this product again\n",
      "I have been using this product for a week now and I can tell a difference in my body post work out.   I have been pushing myself with the weights and was afraid of my muscles being too sore to work out the next day but that hasn't happened since I started using this product.  I am new to supplements so I do not have another brand to compare it too but I will be sticking with this product as I continue my lifting journey!\n",
      "This stuff is great. I use it during my workout and it helps keep me going through that last set. The only reason the Blue Raz gets a 9 instead of a 10 is because the first couple times I used it the after taste was interesting. It is almost like you ate a tube of chapstick but it went away after the first couple uses. \n",
      "I first tried EVL Nutrition products about 6-8 months ago, and I can say with out hesitation that I haven't been let down at all. The LeanBCAAs work great for multiple reason, I have used them to aid in my weight loss while trying to maintain my strength. The LeanBCAA's have allowed me to continue lifting at a high level while gaining strength and losing pounds. Would also recommend this product for its ability to help recovery times. An extra bonus is that the Blue Raz taste great!!! THANKS EVL!\n",
      "Great product and I ncluding CLA and Carnitine makes it even better. I like to stack this with Cre+ and definitely have been seeing noticeable results. Great supp company. \n",
      "This stuff tastes bad and didn't mix into water AT ALL. I contacted customer service and they said that I couldn't exchange it for another product. Disappointed in BB.com\n",
      "This stuff works great I use 2 scoops to 40 oz of water while working out and another drink with a 16 oz water after I have lost 6 lbs since starting this 3 weeks ago i have alot of energy and focus at 48 years old this was the boost i needed to shed wieght and gain mussle I also lost inches and fat and gained lean mussle I work out 6 days a week and am just a regular guy trying to get in shape and loose a few pounds I highly recomend this product but rember you do need to do the work also work out and eat sensible \n",
      "I have to stay that this stuff taste great and it mixes well this is my first BCAA that i have tried and i must say that i'm liking it so far. \n",
      "i decide to give it a try and loved it. the fact that have some cla and l carnitine on it is great cause helps me in my goal of. losing couple pounds, mixes greatand the taste is good!!!! i drink before and during workout and it doesnt give me side effects.\n",
      "Good profile and energy \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The nutrition profile is excellent. I mostly judge by flavors. Vanilla is not my favorite and I usually don't order it, but this one tasted true to flavor. It did taste like vanilla ice cream as opposed to traditional vanilla. The chocolate was good but it had a bit of a chemical taste to it, but definitely not undrinkable. The cookies and cream though. There's cookies and cream and COOKIES and CREAM. This one definitely tasted like cookies, with cream, mixed together, as it should be.\n",
      "Tastes great and mixes well. Great product!\n",
      "Tastes great and mixes well. Seeing good results with this product. Birthday Cake is my favorite flavor\n",
      "Overall pretty good protein blend, I mostly use it during the day, and before training some times. Mixability is good, the vanilla tastes great.\n",
      "Stacked tastes just like the flavor it says. I'd say better than Syntha6. But that's not the best part. I'm seeing some major bulk from this and it's great! \n",
      "I have used several different brands of protein powders over the years, and this one has quickly become my favorite.  EVL has done an amazing job of balancing short and long acting protein, BCAA's, and carbs in a powder that performs better than other powders in this category (and with fewer calories.)  Using staked protein before my workout gives me increased endurance and intensity, and using it after my workout greatly speeds muscle recovery.  Definitely recommend!\n",
      "Best tasting protein I've tried in a long time.  Chocolate peanut butter is amazing.  This is my go to protein now.  Can't wait to try birthday cake flavor next! \n",
      "Honestly this stuff is the best protein I've ever had.  Mixes great and the taste is flat out amazing!!!!  I love this stuff and will be buying 2 more tubs once I run out!\n",
      "I tried the Birthday Cake trial size and absolutely loved it. I used it mainly for Protein waffles and the different sources of protein in this blend make it better for waffles than just a blend of whey concentrate and isolate, they turned out fluffier and not dry as with other brands! I like this brand a lot and will continue to support them in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "PS add some extra sprinkles!! ;)\n",
      "Great chocolate flavor, had a rich taste that was good with water. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this stuff is pretty solid, although I have had better chocolate flavors. Overall no chunks, great mix ability, and a above average tasting chocolate flavor from EVL. \n",
      "I absolutely love this product.  It has given me great results and tastes terrific. The fact that it's a blend is fantastic in the fact that it's giving you a fast and slow digesting proteins. It mixes extremely easy and smooth not chunky at all.\n",
      "Great taste, easy mixing, and awesome profile.  My new favorite protein!\n",
      "The best protein powder I have ever tasted.  No clumping, mixes very easy.  Flavors taste great.  EVL Nutrition is my go to for everything.  Great price and great quality. \n",
      "Great product. Flavor is great and is very filling.\n",
      " \n",
      "This flavor is horrible!!! It  taste like masa for tamales...nasty flavor... Yes I love tamales but not protein flavor...\n",
      "Evlution Nutrition stacked protine is really great, it's easy to mix in a blender bottle and it goes great with water or milk and it's good to if you want to add a banana or peanut butter I drink 2 scoops before and after I workout and I love the fact any flavor you taste great. #EVL \n",
      "By far my favorite whey protein. Great price and great quality. It's not often i looked forward to drinking my protein shake, that's until i tried EVL Stacked Protein it's like desert. Chocolate Decadence is my personal favorite. It's so good i bought nearly 10lbs worth last time. Give it a try! Cookies & Cream 😋😋\n",
      "By far my favorite protein powder!  It's easy to mix, you can even use a spoon.   The flavor is great, no after taste or chunks.  I look forward to drinking at least two shakes a day, one first thing in the morning and one mid-afternoon, giving me supplemental protein and a full feeling between meals.  Can be mixed with anything or made into pancakes and waffles :)\n",
      "Short answer, delicious and smooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But seriously, this protein is delicious. I love chocolate and peanut butter together and this flavor nails it. It blends smooth with just some shaking. There is nothing worse that globs of unmixed protein powder, and I never had that problem with EVL\n",
      "\n",
      "Freakin AWESOME!!! EVL Chocolate Peanut Butter taste so good that my brother try it and kill half the bottle :? It was also very smooth too after mixing using my SmartShake Shaker Cup. Also I use it to make some smoothly and it go very well with some frozen banana. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good protein taste and quality. Cant wait to taste the birthday cake flavor next!! \n",
      "Consuming protein has never been so delightful! With numerous other components such as glutamine and BCAA's, this delicious blend competes performance-wise with all the well reknown brands that are king pins in this industry! The taste is why I switched to Stacked protein. I personally blend my cookies in cream with 1% milk for a creamy decadent post workout treat. There is no after taste and the flavor is nothing short of dreamy! I'll be utilizing this particular protein for a while!!!\n",
      "Love this protein !! Have both the chocolate and vanilla flavors, they mix great without any clumping...No funny after taste like some of the other proteins on the market.! Love the fast and slow absorption. It's also pretty good for baking! Just like their BCAAs, you can't go wrong with the stacked protein . \n",
      "\n",
      "It mixes great tastes great even when mixed with water fits my macros and calorie counts.\n",
      "By far the best tasting protein out there. Let tastes great with water. I totally recommend this flavor. Mixes and blends well.\n",
      "Love the product and the added glutamine is just the icing on the cake!!! Mixes well for on the go protein! \n",
      "EVL has become my go to protein powder.  Mix-ability and taste is awesome.  I'm yet to find a flavor I don't like and more importantly my (extremely picky) wife loves them too (especially birthday cake.). The hardest part is deciding which one to order.  \n",
      "I feel like this protein has room for improvement. The cookies and cream that I got was not the easiest to go down. It did not taste like it dissolved the greatest? seemed like I was drinking melted Cookies and Cream Ice cream and the chunks of cookies were definitely noticeable. Not the greatest flavor. I really enjoyed the chocolate peanut butter though, it dissolved great and was sweet like chocolate. I am a huge peanut butter advocate and was convinced I actually threw a scoop of peanut butter in my mixer with this. It was good post workout and helped with some gains but I feel like I can chalk up a majority of the gains to additional supplementation. Also more than 1/2 of the container when I received it was just air...very disappointing.\n",
      "Love this protein powder! I wanted a protein blend from a company I could trust at a price I could afford. This was my answer!\n",
      "This protein is great! I loved the stacked effect of fast digesting and slow digesting proteins. Mixes well, even with water and tastes great. Birthday cake is amazing, it reminds me of the cake snow cones and it even has little sprinkles. I aso had vanilla ice cream, which was not as good as the birthday cake, but if you used you imagination I could see where it sort of tasted like melted ice cream. Honestly, I'll probably never buy vanilla ice cream again. I even tried to make ice cream by freezing it, just an awkward vanilla flavor. Both flavors also bake well. This protein does the job. I can't complain.\n",
      "Great protein.  I like the blend/ratio.  Will use again.\n",
      "I recommend the chocolate decadence flavor. I take this protein everyday. It mixes very well with no clumping. The protein powder is very smooth as compared to others I have had that can have a grainy texture. I stack this protein with creatine and BCAA. \n",
      "pretty good actually. tastes like bday cake. i use it as an all around vanilla also. it pairs with any recipe that called for vanilla powder. \n",
      "Awesome supplement. Perfect combination of ingredients along with great taste even when mixed with water. Definitely my go to protein. \n",
      "Gains are amazing. Blend of proteins is great for any time use. The flavors are incredible also. I recommend stacked to everyone! \n",
      "On my second jug of birthday cake...great product.  Going to try chocolate peanut butter next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Been waiting for EVL to put out a protein and it was worth the wait.The Chocolate Decadence has a very nice,smooth chocolate taste to it and makes a nice,thick shake.It mixes up real good without clumping or foaming up and leaves no grit behind.The profile matches or surpasses most proteins out there and fits any nutrition plan.Choc PB is my favorite of any choc-pb proteins I have tried with a nice balance of the two flavors.\n",
      "Great taste. Mixes well. We'll purchase again. \n",
      "One of the best tasting protein powders I've had. It blends well with just aboit anything without any clumps. I Like that it is a blend instead of just whey so you get fast and slow digesting protein. Highly recommended! I will continue to purchase Stacked protein in the future!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best tasting protein powders I've had. The vanilla and birthday cake are delicious and mix well with just about anything. The fact that they use a blend instead of just whey so you get fast and slow digesting protein makes it that much better. Highly recommended! Will continue to buy in the future.\n",
      "I have tried many kinds of protein and this is hands down my favorite! Even with just water it is creamy and thicker as if I had used milk. The product dissolves quickly and doesn't leave the chunks of powder like some do. Lastly the flavors taste amazing! \n",
      "This protein powder is great.  The powder dissolves easily and tastes great in water and milk.  I tend to work out later in the night so this is a great late night snack to cap off a work out and a last meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great work, EVL!!\n",
      "This protein powder was great. It had great flavor and didn't leave you feeling bloated after your shake like some brands do. \n",
      "A great product by EVL. I love the birthday cake flavor. Literally taste just like Birthday cake. It mixes great too. Doesn't clump like many proteins do. I would strongly suggest buying this product. I know I will be in the future!\n",
      "The birthday cake flavor is awesome! You really get a bang for your buck on this one.  I take it before and after my workout and never feel like my muscles are hungry. Would definitely recommend and buy again. \n",
      "This is probably the best vanilla protein I've had. Taste is amazing! Texture is awesome! Easy to mix and already has your bcaa's and glutamine \n",
      "One of the best tasting protein powders I've had. The fact that they use a blend instead of just whey so you get fast and slow digesting protein makes it that much better. Highly recommended!\n",
      "With all of the great reviews I was really looking forward to this. I got the variety pack to try out different flavors. So far all I have left to try is cookies and cream, but the chocolate decadence and vanilla flavors were very lacking. They left me with a plastic-like aftertaste and simply nothing like I expected. Very disappointed.\n",
      "I have tried quite a few different proteins and most of them tasted terrible. This blows them all of the water. Excellent taste, excellent results, excellent price. I stand by any EVL products. I won't buy any other protein after having this. \n",
      "Great tasting and packed with everything my muscles need to grow!\n",
      "Having tried a few of the flavors, I can say that cookies and Cream is definitely one of the best tasting protein powders I have used. EVL's protein tends to have better shaker and spoon mixability than others I have tried before. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additives are also pretty good, a serving of BCAAs specifically, to help with recovery post workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a plus, it mixes well without clumping when combined with creatine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: 10/10\n",
      "Mixability 10/10\n",
      "Price: 8/10\n",
      "Ingredients: 9/10\n",
      "This is my favorite brand and protein powder! I've tried vanilla and birthday cake, both are awesome tasting! If you ask me EVL makes the best supplements! Everything tastes great and exceeds expectations everytime!\n",
      "Tried the Choc and Birthday cake. Both mixed and tasted well. Bday cake has sprinkles in it which make it a bit sweeter and a nice changed. Mixed easily and no bad aftertast\n",
      "Stacked is my new go to favorite protien. The birthday cake,vanilla, chocolate peanut butter are all awesome. Easy to mix , super smooth and just like melted ice cream. Get this protien NOW ... YOU WONT REGRET IT!!\n",
      "They taste great. Make excellent protein ice cream if you ever want to change it up from drinking it from shakers.\n",
      "I recently tried EVL Stacked Protein. After trying many different brands and flavores I was instantly a fan!! It tastes great and is easily mixable in a shaker or tall glass of milk. I'm excited to taste their other flavors like birthday cake and vanilla ice cream! I also have their BCAA's. White grape is awesome!! After trying EVL, they are now my go to brand for sure!! Thank you guys!!\n",
      "This is my favorite protein and my favorite brand. The birthday cake taste so good, I now look forward to my protein shakes. It mixes well with no clumping. It's not too sweet so it def helps with the sweet tooth craving without the guilt. \n",
      "I love this product! Mixes well, great taste. Very convenient to have your bcaa and glutamine in it.  This is my go to protein for sure, tried it once and I love it. The results are coming in which it makes me keep coming back for more. I definitely recommend this product to anyone trying to bulk or trim down. Evl really knows what they are doing!\n",
      "Good protein for training but not the best to the taste i have try there is a lot of other protein better on the market !!!\n",
      "The birthday cake flavor is by far the greatest flavor of protein on the market. Most flavors from other companies taste mostly like chemicals. But EVL Stacked actually tastes like it's supposed to. The birthday cake flavor actually has sprinkles in it! \n",
      "This is some great stuff! It mixes very well and every flavor I have had so far is on point especially the Birthday Cake and Chocolate Peanut Butter.  Not to mention it is priced well and love that there are a lot of deals popping up on it as well. EVL is my go to company for all my supplements and will be for the foreseeable future!\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein is my go to blend. The flavors are amazing especially the chocolate peanut butter and there new flavor strawberry is the best one I've had. If you mix it with it milk it's taste just like strawberries and cream. I use this protein before and after my workouts. I will use this protein pretty much any time I want something sweet and tasty. The price is also on point and they always have great deals on their products. \n",
      "Did someone say Birthday Cake!?!? Best. Protein. Ever. Tastes great and satisfies my post-workout protein craving.. and my sweet tooth!! Strawberry is great, too! Thank you, EVL, for yet another fantastic product! <3\n",
      "Best birthday cake flavored protein I've tried! It is also very creamy!\n",
      "This product is very good love the texture. One thing different about the cookies and creams is  it kind of taste like pumpkin to me but that is a huge plus. Defiantly an amazing flavor, the birthday cake is pretty decent.\n",
      "I've been taking EVL Stacked Protein for a few months now, as my morning shake it has a great profile with a mix of fast, medium and slow digesting proteins, from a wide range of sources. This has replaced my ON Pro Complex as my breakfast protein of choice. I chose Stacked Protein because of the included WPH for optimal absorption (extremely important in the morning, as is post-workout) and casein that will keep my muscles energized during office hours, and obviously it's much better value than Pro Complex. And most of the flavours taste so much better than ON Pro! Overall, I think EVL Stacked Protein is a good cross between blends like Syntha-6 (great taste) and Pro Complex (has WPH)!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent product ! Love the taste, the mix and results ! Both good with Milk or Water. \n",
      "Great tasting protein shake, its a little on the sweet side. Well worth the price!\n",
      "For people actually looking for helpful information. This protein was great for recovery. The next few days after hard workouts I had very little fatigue. The muscle mass gains were pretty good i may not have used enough (3lbs) to truly give a completely accurate opinion but, I would give it and 8 in that aspect and a 9.5 for Recovery. The taste was great also, it mixed well and was fine with water.\n",
      "I love that this mixes so well! I've tried a lot of protein powders and this is by far the best. Can't say I'm a huge fan of the birthday cake, it's a little too sweet very much like actual birthday cake. That also just goes to say at how well EVL is at creating realistic flavour. Next time I will probably try the chocolate decadence. Overall, great product! \n",
      "This is my second protein sup. that I used (switched from Orgain Organic Protein). This protein had a awesome sale and I have 3 flavors but so far only tried cookies & cream.  The protein is actually smoother than my previous protein sup. and taste great.  Directions state 6oz per once scoop which was way too sweet for me and I almost threw up, but 10-12oz water worked great minimizing the sweetness without killing the taste. I have also noticed an increase in endurance and more significant gains compared to previous sup. This will definitely be my go to protein and I was lucky to have found it here. Highly recommend because the taste and results will not disappoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: I have now tasted the Chocolate decadence and i would have to say it taste very close to Ovaltine; it mixes well and taste great, but I still prefer the Cookies N Cream. I did notice that its less sweeter than the cookies N cream so I use only 8-10 oz of water for the Chocolate Decadence versus using 10-12 oz for the Cookies N Cream. \n",
      "\n",
      "Update: I tasted Vanilla Ice Cream and it  quickly resembled soy milk which I do not enjoy drinking so I'm planning to incorporate that with some baking rather than drinking it.  The birthday cake was surprisingly as good as everybody was talking about.  It does taste like confetti cake and just as good as the cookies and cream.  I'm glad I purchase both birthday cake and C&C in a 4lb tub; these will be my two flavors to go to finally!\n",
      "I tried this new protein.  Great to take. Lasts a long time. I take it an hour before the gym, gives me a good long pump of protein fuel! Keeps me full for 2-3 hours.. Unlike some other proteins.. Tastes good. I,m sold on it!! Building muscle, no problem!! EVL Products are looking better and better!!\n",
      "Love this protein. Easy mixing, great taste, great price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can't wait to try brihday cake flavor.\n",
      "This protein powder is one of the best ones on the market. I love the peanut butter flavor, and the chocolate one is also really good. It feeds my muscles and keeps my mass with out adding a lot of calories or fat. Great product! All EVL products are great. I would recommend them to everyone. 💪🏼😎👍🏼 \n",
      "Evl products are definitely my favorite products now... I love cookies n cream whey protein so i wanted to try the EVL one and I am not desappointed, nice flavor and texture...\n",
      "Highly recommended!!!\n",
      "I love the taste. Mixes easy, good quality for anyone who looks for and knows the difference.  \n",
      "Bought this as part of a stack with Engn. Have never tried Evl products before but I have to say if the rest of their products line up like their protein and PWO then I will become a faithful customer. The protein was one of the best tasting, easiest mixing and loaded proteins I've ever tried. I'm very happy with the results and actually just ordered another round of the PWO and protein stack. \n",
      "Absolutely love these products and the company so far! Best protein I've used to this point and plan on continuing use for the foreseeable future!!\n",
      "Great tasting protein that blends smooth. Great for any use!\n",
      "I don't understand how chocolate decadence can have a positive rating, especially for taste. It literally smells like horse crap and tastes almost as bad as it smells. Plus I have been working out for 20 years and tried every protein under the sun and this is the first one that actually upset my stomach. I feel the name fits it EVL=EVIL. \n",
      "Chocolate peanut butter is the way to go. Mixes well and tastes great! definitely like the vanilla as well, easy to blend with fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried most protein supplements and I'm sticking with EVL. Was able to achieve great results pre-summer, gaining in size and torching fat. Easy on the stomach, mixes well and tastes delicious even with water.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for an awesome protein blend, this is it. I've gone through 4 tubs of different flavors  and love them all. My favorite is chocolate peanut butter. It mixes and tastes great \n",
      "I absolutely love stacked protein.  The taste is 10/10 and doesn't leave any gross, chalky after taste like most supplements. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to reach their goals. Fantastic supplement and I will continue to use it. \n",
      "One of my favorite protein powders! The birthday cake tastes amazing and mixes great!\n",
      "Loved this protein blend! Great taste and mixability! Chocolate flavor was great too!\n",
      "The flavor is great! Chocolate peanut butter for the win! Smooth, mixes great, even taste great with water, I've noticed a big help in recovery as well! Over all awesome product! Will be buying again \n",
      "I purchased 2 4 lbs containers of the cookies and cream, just finished them and overall it is a good product! The flavor was decent kinda like any other cookies and cream but I mixed mine with 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of water to get the right consistency that I like. It does mix well though. I took a serving 2 times a day to help hit my protein and calorie goal and it lasted about a month per container which was great for the price. Definitely would buy again!\n",
      "I like most of the ingredients, but the flavoring is ROUGH. I am not sure how to describe what the birthday cake tastes like (I will have to give it away... it's bad) and the chocolate peanut butter is pretty heavy in chemical flavor. Maybe it is just me… seen a lot of positive flavor ratings.\n",
      "This is a very affordable protein powder and it is one of the best tasting powders I have ever tried. I've never had any issues with mixing this powder and it doesn't have any harsh odors like some other powders I have tried. I plan to continue using EVL products for a long time!\n",
      "Cookies & Cream was by far my favorite flavor, but Chocolate, Chocolate PB and Vanilla are good too.  Birthday Cake is good as well, the sprinkles were a nice and unexpected touch. Love the protein content and bcaa content. Hands down my favorite protein!!\n",
      "Great flavor like their other products, and mixes so well unlike some other brands. It's also pretty good for baking! I've tried the chocolate and the cookies and cream, and both are amazing! Just like their BCAAs, you can't go wrong with any of these flavors!\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently tried the chocolate peanut butter and birthday cake flavors too, and they're just as good as the original flavors. All these flavors live up to the hype and from a great new company!\n",
      "This protein mixes great and the taste is amazing.  I keep saying I will try all the flavors but I love the chocolate peanut butter.  Stacked with high quality protein and glutamine this stuff has everything your body needs after those tough workouts or in between meals. EVL all day everyday. \n",
      "I had switched over to EVL Stacked Protein from a different brand that I had been using for years, and I am glad that I made the switch! EVL Stacked Protein is high quality, mixes well, and tastes great! Birthday Cake is my favorite flavor so far - can't wait to try out the others!\n",
      "I love this protein! The chocolate decadence tastes great and is very smooth and creamy mixed with almond milk. One of the best proteins Ive had and will continue to purchase this brand. I am very pleased with the results I am getting, and its great that the protein has rapid and slow release proteins. Overall amazing protein. \n",
      "This is my favorite protein that I have ever tried!!! (And I've been through a lot of em!) It is so easy to mix, and tastes like dessert. I recommend it to all of my friends!! Evlution makes some great products. \n",
      "This has become my favorite protein, I tried the vanilla and the chocolate flavored but the cookies in creme just taste the best to me. I take it every morning when i wake up and right after my after noon workout. EVL products have become a must have in my home. Great company that makes great products definitely recommend it to anyone who is thinking about buying some.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had high expectations for this protein, maybe too high because I read all good reviews on this but when I received it, it tasted like chemicals. maybe I got a bad batch or this product is straight chemical tasting. now I'll go back syntha-6 because that's the best tasting one on the market. \n",
      "I just got my 8lbs of stacked and have only had my peanut butter protein sandwich mix but I'm gonna rate it anyways. I rated it a 9 based on price, calories per serving, and protein per serving. I'm trying to drop some body fat so low cal is good. Price is definitely a plus, and I like that they filled the tub pretty good compared to most. Flavor was a 7 because it was a little chalky and flavor wasn't that strong but not too bad. I'll definitely continue to go through evl just maybe chocolate decadence next time.\n",
      "Me and my husband love EVL. We use this brand not only for the protein but we have also bought and bcaa energy stack and loved it as well. We will be reordering again as soon as we are almost out of it. :)\n",
      "great mixability, easy on the stomach, numbers are not bad, will buy again. \n",
      "Both of these flavors were AMAZING and they bake super well!!! Plus The price point is right! Love them sooo much!!\n",
      "This is my go to protein, I take one scoop after a workout and another one before bed. I have noticed results very quickly and enjoy all evl products. I also suggesting adding a scoop of chocolate peanut butter cup to pancake mix, really good!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Delicious when mixed with milk. And did I say they taste great. No chalk!  Great pre and post work out a lot of good stuff \n",
      "Got this product after looking for a change from the usual Optimum Nutrition whey I would usually buy. Overall GREAT decision! The chocolate decadence flavor is fantastic, and provides a great consistency for my overnight oats. Definitely will be buying again! \n",
      "This protein is just downright amazing. Mixes well, tastes great, and no stomach issues. Best of all the proteins i ever purchased ( MP Combat, Pro Jym, etc..) The birthday cake flavor makes me want to drink protein all day!! Great blend of protein as well. Get this stuff!\n",
      "Well this protein has a good taste was doubting to get this one but im glad i got it it taste great mixes well with almond milk tried it with water also but its was good it wasnt bad at all but i perfer it with almond milk. I only take this postworkout will try to mix it with EVL BCAA see how it goes. has anyone tried this with reg milk like 2% or whatever milk u like if so let me know would perfer my reg 2% milk for this shake.\n",
      "By far top protein I've taken and the birthday cake flavor is delicious!!!  I've already ordered another container and won't use anything else. \n",
      "First of all, *******! This protein is the ****. I have the 2 pound tub of birthday cake flavor and this is downright THE best flavor of protein I've ever had. It's absolutely fanfuckingtastic. It mixes incredibly well, too. I will definitely be buying the 4 pound tub when this one runs out (which will be soon because I take about 4 scoops everyday, it's that good). I can't gauge the gains just yet since I only started this about two weeks ago and I'm using other proteins simultaneously, but I don't doubt it's doing good. I feel much better after I have a shake of this, at least, so there's that. Definitely recommended, especially this flavor.\n",
      "First time I write a review, I had to do it, the birthday cake flavor is just out of this world I mixed it up with quick oatmeal and it was like being in a party having some cake I highly recommend this flavor. It tastes like the real deal\n",
      "Solid product!! Mixes easy, tastes great. Mixing it with raspberry creatine and it's awesome! Will buy again.\n",
      "One of the best tasting proteins I've ever had. It has a good variety of protein sources. I will for sure buy this product again \n",
      "Finally! An affordable protein blend. Studies show that blends are much more conducive to muscle building but most blends use cheap sources of protein or charge an astronomical amount. Good sources and a decent price EVL has my buy. My only complaint is that the new birthday cake flavor has a chemical taste when mixed with water, so I'd suggest using milk. \n",
      "Loved it. Good taste. Excellent quality \n",
      "Great product! \n",
      "I have almost gone through the entire 30 serving big bottle over the past 2 months and feel comfortable writing a review on it now. Disclaimer I only use immediately after a workout, and upon waking in the mornings if I am feeling extra beat down and sore from the previous workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this is a great product. It mixes really well with little to no froth or leftover reside on the sides of your shaker. The taste is about what you would expect, its not delicious by any means but if you want something that really tastes like an ice cream well... go get one. Considering what it is, the taste compared to others (I only drink Vanilla) is really good. The stacked protein sits well immediately after drinking it is not too heavy, and does not curb your appetite for real food like some of the other brands I have tried. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ingredient list is what swayed me to give this a shot and it did not disappoint. High quality protein blends, glutamine, and some BCAA's all in one shot you can go wrong with this product as a lifter who is on the go. The price is competitively set and is worth the money in regards to what you get. Stacked is perfect for the lifter who knows this product is only a temporary stop gap until you can consume real food. \n",
      "This product was awesome!  The taste, how it mixes and the results were just as expected from EVL.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to try out a new protein.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend the Chocolate Decandence flavor.  Combine this with 8oz of vanilla almond milk and you got a great tasting shake!  The Chocolate Peanut Butter is great too, but I will say that it had a bit of a sour after tastes, which was odd.  Overall, you cannot go wrong with this!\n",
      "I have used several proteins powders and EVL Protien was very good. The taste was good and it mixed well. And the price was affordable. I would buy it again\n",
      "The best protein powder that I have used in a long time. The taste is great and mixes very smoothly! I will continue to use this product!!!\n",
      "Overall it's a pretty good protein. It wasn't my favorite tasting chocolate peanut butter, but I liked that it included bcaas and glutamine. I wouldn't mind getting stacked protein again as a different flavor.\n",
      "Great Protein! Mixes easy and taste great! Love this as well as all EVL products! Keep up the good work!\n",
      "Big fan.  Tasted good, helped achieve results.  Great product for a fair price.\n",
      "I enjoyed the chocolate peanut butter, but I was disapointed by the chalky taste of the chocolate decadence. The gains from the supplement were legitimate but I expect as much and i believe the company isn't known to protein spike. I will probably buy from another place to try more because it was a completely hit or miss expirience. Maybe another flavor is as good as the CPB, but i wouldn't risk trying something as bad as the Chocolate decadence \n",
      "You guys are way too nice, give a product a \"10\" if it is the best ever or matches.  This protein mixes well, no clumps, smooth, no bloat, but taste is an 8 out of 10. The flavour is nothing new or special like syntha-6, it is your standard chocolate.\n",
      "Guys. I dig this protien so much! Great taste and very easy to mix in. I can shake it up with my shaker and there are no clumps so it's easy to hit right after a workout. Not to mention it's a great price. Definitely try this bad boy out!\n",
      "I love this protein... it tastes great and mixes very well. I've also put on lean muscle mass since I've started taking it. I would highly recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "A perfect protein blend! This product mixes very easy and is one of the best tasting protein shakes I've tried. \n",
      "I bought this because blended proteins are ideal for the \"any time\" type of situation I often find myself in on weekends....hungry, but also cutting and not wanting to eat junk.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This protein has a consistency somewhere between casein and whey but mixes as well as any whey I've used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste was good, no complaints at all there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing I didn't 100% love is that there are some extra calories over a typical whey or casein protein of some competitors. It's an admittedly small price to pay though when you consider how filling this stuff is.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I love this protein. I'm just starting to get back into the groove of things but I can tell the difference. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great product and taste. I found that it had everything you need for daily protien intake.\n",
      "This is a great choice for your protein needs! a nice mix of fast and slow acting protein keeps me full after my morning workout and I get a good recovery from this vs. no post workout supplement. \n",
      "\n",
      "The cookies and cream is very good, I have tried ON and I find that this tastes MUCH better, it is a little sweet, but the flavor is very good. \n",
      "\n",
      "The vanilla and chocolate are very good as well, but pretty standard vanilla and chocolate taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have bought EAS and ON whey, and I will only be buying EVL in the future. The price is unbeatable for the mix of protein you get. \n",
      "Great product, I love how it doesn't just have whey and casein proteins but it also contains egg white protein as well. \n",
      "This is defiantly the best protein I have tasted, mixes with ease. Was using muscle tech phase 8 and ON whey. Will no longer use them after trying EVL stacked. Birthday cake is my favorite, chocolate decadence should be called hot cocoa taste just like it which is by far good with me, this would be my 2nd favorite. Vanilla ice cream is very good and goes great with anything usually add a scope to my smoothies for a neutral cream/vanilla taste, my 3rd go to flavor. Cookies is cream is straight forward my 4th go to. The chocolate and peanut butter is my last choice because of the faint taste of the peanut butter. All these protiens blend so well and the taste is by far better then the two I mentioned. Defiantly sticking to EVL stacked protein can't wait for more flavors.\n",
      "I hate the taste of casein protein so the fact that this blend has some in it gives it a bit of a handicap in the flavor department.  However, I found that mixing with water instead of milk made a world of difference, which is weird because it's typically the other way around.  I gave this brand a try because the price was right.   I was not disappointed. \n",
      "Both the Vanilla Ice Cream and the Chocolate Decadence are very sweet tasting but still much much better than proteins I've had in the past that leave you with very little flavor. Protein mixes very well in EVL Shaker bottle with water and/or almond milk. Very satisfied with protein and will be trying the other flavors soon. \n",
      "Protein mixed well, but the taste left something to be desired. It was very muted, and I wouldn't consider it a particularly flavorful protein; however, it wasn't offensive to the palate\n",
      "I have seen MUCH GAINS in the first 2-3 days and its been a week and i'm seeing fast results, i've taken other protein supps on BBCOM but this one is STACKED!!!!   It has all you need to make muscle  ( i like to grab vanilla flavors and for versatility). It's very light... a scoop is huge but wheys nothing LOL \"wheys\" (weighs). I take 2-3 a day when waking up and immediately after a workout then at bed if i'm very sore. If i do training twice a day.. i could even go up to 4 depending on how much protein in food i have not gotten that day but one should always drink water in MY OPINION (acids). Tastes great with milk/water.  Best PRICE FOR THE QUALITY AND GAINS THIS PRODUCT PROVIDES.   10 for being the best bang for buck whey protein and a great brand.\n",
      " :D\n",
      "I really enjoy this protein. The birthday cake is freaking awesome! I normally take combat from musclepharm but I think this will be my go to now. \n",
      "I have only had one scoop of this protein powder so far. I usually mix my powder with milk, because I hate powder with water. The chocolate decadence felt like i was licking a sugar stick. Much too strong and sweet for my liking. I will not bring down the overall rating, because I have no results yet to base it on. If you have an extreme sugary sweet tooth this is the product for you.\n",
      "I mixed with water on vanilla and cookies&cream. And it was alright. The chocolate I mixed witg whole milk and it was amazing. So I'm getting 5 serving sample of chocolate again and birthday cake to tty different ways.\n",
      "Really great tasting protein!! I liked the vanilla ice cream more than the cookies and cream, but both are good really. The vanilla is pretty sweet, which I like for my sweet tooth! I also have baked protein muffins with this protein and it works great. Definitely one of the best tasting proteins I've gotten. My go to proteins for the last few months have been Cellucor Whey and the Animal Whey from Universal Nutrition, but EVL's has def made it on my list now of go to brands! \n",
      "This protein powder is hands down one of my favorites. It mixes very easily and tastes great. I have had the chocolate peanut butter and vanilla ice cream and they're both amazing, they taste like milkshakes. I add cinnamon to the chocolate peanut butter and it tastes even better. Not bad for the price either. \n",
      "Great product! It was the first protein I ever bought and I don't think I'd want any other!\n",
      "Great product with great results. First stacked protein that I've used and really seeing the results. Can't beat the price with buy one and one 50%. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Great product! The protein in itself would not clump up in my shaker bottle and it had an amazing taste to it. Great amount of protein and amigos per scoop. Would definitely buy again and recommend it to friends!\n",
      "This is one of my fav proteins I've tried and I have tried several. I love that it already has extra bcaa and glutamine so I don't have to worry about taking those right away if I forget. The flavor is great with milk or water. I use a little extra powder if mixing with water just to make the taste stronger but I will continue to buy this product! \n",
      "Just recently started using this product, and so far it's very easy to mix, tastes great, and has promising benefits for long term use. I haven't been taking it long enough to know if it's helping build or keep muscle, but I know that the price and quality will definitely have me using it for awhile. Keep up the great work EVL!\n",
      "Good blend but wouldn't buy again unless on a really good sale. Taste is not pleasing vs some other brands I have had. \n",
      "After so many different protein shakes,i've used, this one is perfect. Great tastes too. Also well priced. Definitely will buy again !\n",
      "Bought two tubs when it was on sale. First time trying this brand so I took a chance, The Chocolate Peanut Butter wasn't bad, it tastes better mixed in water. Used in almond milk and it tastes like cardboard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vanilla Ice Cream was a little better but maybe a tad sweet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I believe it helped with recovery and didn't give me any gas\n",
      "This protein does the job. High protein, carbs are low and the birthday cake flavor is amazing!\n",
      "I've noticed a decent amount of muscle gains for the past month of mini bulking while taking stacked protein by EVL. This protein definitely helped me reach my macros when I consume 3-4 times a day; 1 in the morning after waking, 1 pre-workout, 1 post-workout and 1 before bed. The taste has a slight metallic taste to it possibly due to enzymes mixed in. However, if you mix it with full milk, the taste becomes 10x better and the aftertaste is minimal. I wouldn't say it's te best protein drink I'm drinking, but it's definitely a recommended product for whoever is looking for a decent protein blend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been an EVL customer for the past year and I can honestly say the Stacked Protein supplement hasn't disappointed me with taste or performance. I've tried every flavor and they've all been delicious. The vanilla tastes like ice cream and I never feel bloated or gassy after as I've done with other brands. Stacked is absolutely my go to protein supplement, hands down.\n",
      "One of the best lines of protein I've ever had. Definitely worth investing in!\n",
      "DAAYYUUMM, this product is incredibly tastey and offers excellent post workout protein!!\n",
      "Nice profile. Mixes up very easily. Nice, smooth, and creamy. Tried with almond milk, 2% milk, and a blend of both. Works well with 6-8 oz liquid. Chocolate generally isn't my first choice in protein flavors, but the Chocolate Decadence was quite awesome! Looking forward to trying the new birthday cake flavor.\n",
      "I loved this protein.  It mixes well in my shakers when I am using it as a post workout recovery or for a snack during the day.  I have also found that it works very well when making food products.  I have made a cinnamon banana protein pancake with the Vanilla Ice Cream protein.  I have recommended this to all my friends.\n",
      "Good product, mixes well, wish it had more casein in it to hold off hunger longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate Decadence is by far the best flavor, mix it with ice cold water and it is about like drinking brownie batter. (ordering more so I can try a crushed ice blender smoothie for desert)\n",
      "\n",

      "Chocolate Peanut Butter, is my second favorite, but needs but stronger peanut butter flavor.\n",
      "Vanilla and Cookies & cream are ok, but flavors are weak. cookies & cream left cookie bits in my shaker bottle.\n",
      "First real SOY taste protein that I like.  I like their protein so far, but have only tried 2 flavors; vanilla and cookies and creams (both good).  \n",
      "This protein its so good for any time of the day and this flavor is very very nice, i like so much\n",
      "Great taste\n",
      "This is one of EVL's newest products and now one of my favorites. It mixes great without the thick/bulkiness like most protein mixes. Also there is little to no foam from shaking which means no waste and you are not sitting there waiting for it to go into your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stuff works great and taste great!!! I highly recommend mixing it with milk for an added protein boost and taste. Take directly after workouts and for meal replacements for best results.\n",
      "One of the best favors I've bought. Big fan of the Borthday cake. Good mix-ability as well. Goes down smooth. More than likely going to purchase more down the road. \n",
      "Okay so this product gives me mixed feelings. Overall the protein is good. I have tasted better, but it does get the job done. Chocolate/Peanut Butter is always my favorite of any protein. Would get again if they had promotion.\n",
      "Love it! \n",
      "First great thing is that I ordered this product as well as the fatter burners and they were delivered the next day! \n",
      "I tried out the cookies and cream stacked protein after my workout today and was like, \"wow!\" It tasted so good, was super smooth, and was filling.  Highly recommend it. \n",
      "This was my first time trying Stacked Protein. I have a sweet tooth so I usually like exotic and sweet flavors but I needed something \"normal\" for a change of pace. The Chocolate Decedance and Vanilla Ice Cream for the bill...they both taste very good...8.5. I love that it's made in a NSF, GMP certified manufacturing plant and has no amino spiking. The added glutamine and digestive enzymes are important to me because of their importance in gut health. Thanks for putting out a great product, EVL!\n",
      "Great blended protein supplement.  The price is very reasonable.  The results are solid.  The best flavor in my opinion is chocolate peanut butter.  Mixes well with water and a little bit of almond milk for flavor enhancement.  Based on the price, quality and taste, I would highly recommend if you are looking for a quality blended protein without breaking the bank.   \n",
      "NOT IMPRESSED\n",
      "This protein powder is awesome! I was looking for a more affordable alternative to Pro-Jym, and I found it with this product. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Chocolate Peanut Butter tastes OK, It has a cardboard undertone IMO. I do not mind though, I can imagine it's very hard to capture both flavors, accurately, into 1 powder mix. This is my go-to flavor for before and after workouts. \n",
      "- Chocolate Decadence is my favorite. Mixed with water, it's not the greatest. However, I mix it with 2% milk, and it tastes just like chocolate milk. This was used as my morning protein supplement. \n",
      "- Cookies & Cream is my least favorite of the 3 I tried. It tastes exactly like Cookies & Cream, the cream flavor was just a bit overpowering IMO. I tried it just because I was sent a 5 serving sample, and I figured I'd give it a shot. Cookies & Cream isn't really my flavor of choice to begin with. I will not purchase this flavor again. However, I can presume that if you like Cookies & Cream, you will LOVE this flavor. Due to my bias, I did not rate this flavor. I feel that would be unfair. \n",
      "\n",
      "As far as PERFORMANCE goes, I feel that this product works equally as well as the Protein that I switched from. Recovery time and muscle growth has not been hindered by my decision to switch. With the sale that was going on when I purchased this product, there is no comparison to others. This will definitely be my go-to protein from here on out. \n",
      "Birthday cake is amazing! I've always been a fan of evl stacked protein so I was super excited when I saw this flavor was coming out. It's a light protein that tastes delicious. Not overly sweet but still tastes like birthday cake. My favorite is to make a smoothie with it. 1.5 scoop of birthday cake protein, milk, ice, then blend. Stick it in the freezer after and it tastes like a birthday cake milkshake. So good!!!\n",
      "This protein has been the best tasting and easiest to mix of those that I have tried. I would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "Great protein powder - mixes really well.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is a little too sweet for my taste, but easily mixable, so I won't have any trouble using it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate peanut butter could stand just a tad more peanut butter flavor, but overall really yummy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate decadence is good, nothing special about the flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really impressed with the quality for the cost.\n",
      "First off, I'm super picky with flavor. I despise basic flavors because they're so boring!! I purchased the 5 lb tub of Birthday Cake - OH MY GOD! I thought it was mass gainer or something because it is SO GOOD! I use it to make pancakes, protein cupcakes/cakes and doughnuts and of course normal protein shakes! I absolutely love love love the vanilla ice cream to use as frosting (mix 1 scoop with 1 cup of plain greek yogurt and stevia if needed) and put in the fridge and BAM! IT IS AMAZING! I like the chocolate decadence with almond milk...I can't even right now :) Super impressed with EVL I will definitely be a future consumer :)\n",
      "I liked this proteinpowder alot. Cookies and cream tasted awesome.  Chocolate decadence wasn't my favorite but it wasn't bad tasting. Both easily mixed with little effort. I'll note that the cookies and cream made me feel really full so I used it alot between meals to curb cravings. \n",
      "Great tasting protein, mixes well and certainly can see the difference since switching to EVL Nutrition stacked protein. EVL offers nothing but top of the line products. \n",
      "This protein tastes great & mixes easily. Most of all it does not upset my stomach or cause bloat which a lot of others do. Overall great product & I will continue to use after my morning workout & again before bed. \n",
      "This has a terrible after taste, an almost chemical like flavor. I also had the same experience with this brands cookies and cream flavored protein. I am going back to using Isopure protein, or even Optimum Nutrition. \n",
      "Taste is great and mixes very well, no clumps or grittiness!\n",
      "First time I have tried the Evlution Stack protein product. The chocolate taste is just right, not too sweet, not too bland. I also purchased Cookies and Cream and Chocolate PB, but haven't tried yet. Thanks to awesome customer service by 'Ninja Neb' for ensuring I got the right promotional discount. bb.com is my go to source for all things supplement and training focused.\n",
      "Superb product overall! It feels as if muscle recovery is great; I noticed I feel less sore. The taste is phenomenal when mixed with coconut almond milk. \n",
      "Awesome taste! Mixes easily! I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Just as everyone else says, the flavor is amazing. Very smooth and mixes very well. EVL knows what they are doing and their customer service is top notch.\n",
      "This protein is great. I have recently started using the blended proteins and this is the best I have tried.  It tastes good, macro levels are good and it mixes extremely well. Great product.\n",
      "I've been using EVL Stack protein a little over a month now. I'm not only shocked by the results I'm in love with the taste!! I'be tryed all flavors accept the Bithday cake but it's getting order soon as Choco gets low. Once again another flawless EVL product that has become a staple in our household. My wife does crossfit and she hates mostly all proteins!! Until the day I ask her \"C'mon babe just try this one\" BOOM!! She instantly looked at me and said WOOOW!!! That's really good babe! One month later she like babe!! \"When are we ordering more EVL PROTEIN??\" LOL She's a believer now. Great price, Great Product, Keep up the great work guys. \n",
      "The protein is quality. It mixes well and tastes great. If anyone is looking for a nice clean protein this is for you. EVL has the best products out there. \n",
      "EVL's stacked protein is incredible. When I tried EVL about a month ago I was looking for a protein that was a blend of fast and slow releasing proteins. I had tried a couple others and wasn't impressed...THEN I finally tried EVL. The flavors are pretty good, especially the cookies and cream. I have never found a cookies and cream protein I like until now. In the past month of using EVL I can feel and see a huge difference in my weight , strength, and workouts.\n",
      "Mixes well with water and great taste! \n",
      "very solid profile but below average taste. especially the vanilla didnt taste like vanilla at all. all i tasted were sweeteners tbh. c&c was slightly better but still nothing i looked forward to drinking..\n",
      "\n",
      "anyways, given the ok price not the worst of choices.\n",
      "First off, I'm a peanut butter and chocolate junkie, so when I finally found a PB/chocolate protein powder that I like I was pretty excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would give this protein a 10/10 due to the 2 inches I added to my chest with no weight gain over 2-3 months, but I did experience a little stomach sensitivity at first as I adjusted from another protein brand.  Within 2 weeks of use, I was completely adapted and enjoying the fullness and recovery from the shake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Addendum: tried the cookies and cream flavor.  Holy cow, mixed with milk it was like drinking melted cookies and cream ice cream.  I now have grand plans to take the C&C flavor and freeze it slightly and eat it just like ice cream.\n",
      "I decided to give this protein a shot after really enjoying some of EVL other products. (I love the PWO and the BCAA). I am picky with protein and usually do not enjoy the tastes. I am a believer in using a blend of slow and fast digesting sources and when I seen that EVL had a protein powder I had to try it. I am a person who looks at labels quite a bit and this is a quality product. No amino spiking! I got the vanilla because I don’t typically like flavors but the vanilla was pretty good. I look forward to trying the other flavors as well. There is often a good deal on the protein and EVL has become one of my top brands.\n",
      "Had the chocolate peanut butter and loved this stuff. Taste was great and mixed well in milk, water or shakes. I highly recommend the chocolate pb. \n",
      "Also had the cookies and cream, and while I wasn't a fan of the flavor, it was given to a friend who loved it, so I cannot speak badly of the flavor, just wasn't for me.\n",
      "The 5 serving containers are awesome for leaving in the locker in case you ever need a quick shake at work.\n",
      "Wanted to try a blend and took advantage of the BOGO. Taste is good, although the chocolate peanut butter was a little weak. Had some problems with mixing fully - definitely getting a wrist workout with all the extra shaker bottle action. I do enjoy the feeling of a blend - feels like it sustains me energy- and appetite-wise a little more than the 100% whey I generally take. \n",
      "Of course nothing can replace a good diet, but I have to say that EVLUTION NUTRITION has quickly become my favorite brand of supplements. Their stacked protein is the best tasting protein I've tasted and I've tried plenty. It beats out ON, Muscletech, MusclePharm, BSN, Animal Whey, BPI, and EAS. The only other protein that taste good to me is Pro Jym, but EVL stacked protein beats it in the cost department (just by a little though). I can't think of one bad thing to say about this protein mix. I've purchased several tubs and have seen great improvements when taking it after my workouts. My muscle recovery has been shorter, strength is greater, and my overall size is bigger. What else could I ask for? I also take their ENGN pre-workout, and sometimes their BCAA Energy when I'm in the need for an energy boost. It's only EVL products for me from here on out.\n",
      "Tastes very good and mixes very well.  Has a great breakdown of protein types, which allows me to use it postworkout and between meals for a healthy snack!  No complaints so far!\n",
      "I bought the full stack so I was able to try all 4 flavors. I would say all of them are really tasty.  I am experiencing some constipation but that seems to be the norm for me with any protein, in any form. I like the profile and hope its legit. I wish I knew the exact ratio of actual protein in this product like say a pro gym. Unfortunately Pro Jym is out of my price range so I use this for anytime a day and stick to pure whey after my workouts. Overall its a good product for the price. I hope we don't find out it has something crazy in it because they are really trying move all EVL products.\n",
      "I like that they offer a variety pack so I can at least try out some flavors and not buy an entire tub of a flavor I can't drink. I am sucker for vanilla especially in my oatmeal and this one unlike most didn't disappoint. The other 2 flavors were good as well and the powder mixed easily as a shake and my oatmeal. When I run out of my current tub I will probably be ordering more of this.\n",
      "This has become one of my staples. The consistency is not quite milkshake, but it's fairly thick which I find keeps me feeling fuller for longer. I love having a dependable, blended protein for anytime of the day/night since my work and gym schedule fluctuate so often. As far as taste, the cookies and cream is probably top 3 for me in that protein flavor, quite tasty The chocolate is also really good. Vanilla, however was a bit strong for me and left my blender bottle smelling kind lf like maple syrup even after I washed it. It was okay, just not my favorite. As can be expected , all flavors were much better when mixed with milk. At the end of the day though, I'll definitely continue to buy this protein, thanks EVL!\n",
      "Fabulous protein !!! Mixes well with no after taste.  Some vanilla brands taste like raid the bug killer. Gross. But not this one. I am truly happy and will continue to use. I cook with it , protien pancakes , cereal, muffins , protien ice cream , oatmeal etc.  \n",
      "I have searched over the years a lot of different brands. Some have high sodium. Some had high fillers.  And now with the spiking scam I am very very picky on who I spend my hard earned cash with.  Thank you for\n",
      "Making a great product that truly stands behind its athletes. \n",
      "Awesome protein blend. Not only does it have quick digesting protein it also has slowed digesting protein to keep you fuller longer and feeds the muscles over a longer period of time. Great taste, and mixes really well. One of the best tasting proteins that I have ever tried! I definitely recommend this product! 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ For sure\n",
      "I purchased this protein wanting to explore new things..\n",
      "And I fell in love with the way it mixes and the taste quality of this product.. Definitely worth the buy.. I highly recommend you try it if you like chocolate cake.. Hahaha\n",
      "I love chocolate protein and this is definitely among my favorite ones. The flavor is on point and dissolves easily.\n",
      "I love stacked protein! I have added significant size and strength gains since beginning using it and the flavors are delicious.\n",
      "My review is gonna be about the flavor alone. This protein powder didn't taste that bad to me, but I've had better. It tastes like a watered down vanilla ice cream shake. If you have had Real Gains Vanilla Ice Cream it tastes like that but doesn't have as much depth. It has a very quick vanilla taste even when I used less water to make the flavor stronger.\n",
      "Best protein shake i have ever tried. Syntha-6 was my favourite before I tried this one. But now this is my new favourite protein shake. Great taste, awesome results.\n",
      "Love this protein complex\n",
      "Fast,med,and slow digesting protein\n",
      "Good taste\n",
      "Great VALUE!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "EVL does not dissapoint! !!\n",
      "Like many others on here that iv'e read reviews from, I take this as a second shake throughout the day and preserve my whey isolate for right after the gym.  I Look forward to this shake more so than the whey ( even though acknowledging the gains whey gives you after getting swole is inevitable and you look forward to it too) it's just so much better in taste and is much thicker, therefore being more satisfying.  I usually mix it with unsweetened almond milk and it goes down too fast to enjoy it as much as I want to.\n",
      "I must say EVL did a great job with the flavoring of this protein. You can either drink this with water (which I drink) or milk and it still tastes amazing with low carbs. The blend of Whey/ Casein allows you to drink this any time of the day! Amazing Product! \n",
      "\n",
      "This is my 1st experience w/Evlution and this product for me is fair at best.  I can compare it to other Protein Blends I have used from Beast and Allmax and both are far superior in creating a good authentic taste and consistency that is smooth.  This product does not do that.  Maybe another flavor like Vanilla may work better but at the end of the day there texture or consistency will be the same.\n",
      "Hands down one of the best proteins I've tried. The chocolate peanut butter flavor and vanilla ice cream were DELICIOUS. I also enjoy how it has different types of proteins in it to keep your muscles fed for longer! \n",
      "Hands down the best tasting protein on the market! The ingredients are also great for recovery and gaining muscle! It's an obvious must buy!\n",
      "Very good protein blend. Love that it also contains BCAAs for better recovery. Slow and Fast digesting protein makes taking this product anytime possible.\n",
      "This is my favorite protein powder. I'm a big advocate of protein blends, as I believe they are more effective than any type of protein because they deliver and digest at different rates/speed. Aside from Jim Stoppani's Jym Pro, this is the best stuff out there! It delivers just like Jym Pro, but EVL gives you much better deals! I recommend this protein for beginners and veterans; this stuff is simply the best out there! \n",
      "I received a sample of the chocolate decadence and it tasted great. I immediately bought a tub of chocolate and cookies and cream. This protein mixes really well in water, leaving no clumps. The cookies and cream tastes even better in milk. I like that there is only 140 calories per serving and only 5 grams of carbs. I also really enjoy that this protein comes with 5 grams of glutamine already in it. I will definitely be buying Evl stacked protein from now on. \n",
      "Awesome! Great taste. Solid nutrients.  Dissolves easily without clumps.  And reasonably priced! What more can you ask for!\n",
      "Ordered this protein because of the awesome special that was running on the stack. I hadn't heard of the brand before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off - the vanilla ice cream legitimately tastes like melted vanilla ice cream when mixed with water. This was perhaps the most enjoyable protein-water combo I've had.\n",
      "\n",
      "| Mixability - 9/10. Mixed with 6oz water and a blender ball, it's perfect. If no ball and just shaking, there is a slight clumpiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "| Texture - 10/10. Very smooth, no grit. \n",
      "\n",
      "| Flavor - 9/10. As mentioned earlier, vanilla ice cream has a very very pleasant taste. The cookies and cream leaves some to be desired. Oddly, it's not as sweet as the vanilla? If they would put them together, it would be more creamy.\n",
      "\n",
      "| Nutrition - 10/10. 25 g of protein, with only a few carbs. I like the addition of glutamine as I have personally noticed glutamine improves my recovery. I haven't found any third party studies, but \"no amino spiking\" is right there on the label. That's a very profound claim and I tend to believe it.\n",
      "Amazing protein! Great taste and seen great muscle gains. This is a key to my diet and even make desserts with it! Highly recommended\n",
      "So I just received my package this afternoon, and I decided to try out the Chocolate peanut butter flavor first. This chocolate peanut butter whey protein taste just like a roasted peanut butter cup coffee. The texture is very well made. I like the fact that it does contain casein and egg protein, and I like the fact that it has digestive enzymes. Overall, the whey protein is very good and I will definitely be getting some more.\n",
      "OK this was a great deal, wanted to try for a long time. Mixes good. No stomach discomfort, tastes great!! Definitely worth trying. Oh does NOT make a good pudding or the new sludge everyone is trying. At least I don't think so. \n",
      "This is my favorite casein product! the taste is amazing! the quantity of proteins and others per scoop is excellent! i used optimun and bsn before, now i'm using only this casein product!\n",
      "I received a sample of each flavor to try and am excited to try chocolate peanut butter in the future. A great a protein, no bloating or upset stomach. Definitely feeling the GAINZ!\n",
      "I started taking EVL stacked protein after seeing their recent sale and deciding to give them a shot, considering I have never used EVL supplements before. The stacked protein mixes very well (I use unsweetened almond milk for better consistency). I got 2 free 5 serving packages so I was able to try the Chocolate Peanut Butter, Vanilla Ice Cream, and Cookies n Cream. All 3 were excellent. The Stacked Protein is very lean, implements a decent amount of BCAA's and really helped along my recovery. I would recommend this product highly. \n",
      "This is really great protein powder! I have tried many different kinds and I have to say this is in my top 3 favorites. The flavors are really tasty and the vanilla is awesome mixed in with oatmeal or any kind of baking. I really wasn't to impressed with the chocolate peanut butter flavor.....it was a little disappointing but the cookies and cream and vanilla are amazing. I also love to use this as a meal replacement for lunch. Keeps me full and energized. I definitely recommend it! \n",
      "This protein powder tastes great in Chocolate PB and Cookies and Cream. Mixes well with cold water and ice cold almond milk. It is very creamy and smooth when you mix it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I love the blend of Casein and Whey so I do not have to buy multiple powder. It seems EVLution is on point with their products.\n",
      "I love this protein powder over all others I've tried. Maybe it's the ice cream flavor. I mix a scoop of this in with 8 ounces of V8-Fusion light, banana-strawberry, Some ice and blend it in my NutriBullet. It's such a healthy treat. \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is awful, I had to dump it in trash can.\n",
      "This protein is one of the greatest proteins I have ever tasted. It also has the same protein blend of many of the leading companies, they offer a better price and deal. The best part is it's only 160 calories per scoop! \n",
      "\n",
      "I tend to use the cookies and cream with ground oatmeal in my shake as a meal replacement and it is truly the greatest thing ever. I have tried many different brands/flavors and this was the best one with it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Must try protein, you will not regret your purchase.\n",
      "Mixes perfectly. Tastes delicious. Cookies and cream is great!\n",
      "I love this product. I have been taking for about 2 weeks. It gives me great recovery and solid amount of protein with out the crappy taste. Stacked mixed well for me with some water and tasted amazing my favorite is by far chocolate but the others were amazing too. As someone really into the gym protein is a big factor in reaching goals I recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like it. It works muscles don't hurt bad and great taste mixes well with water or milk\n",
      "Excellent taste and performance \n",
      "You can buy many different comparable proteins these days...so I rate most of them by taste and EVL's Cookies and Cream tastes HORRIBLE. If you don't care much about taste, then try this. \n",
      "Love the slow and fast metabolizing proteins. Added BCAA's and Glutamine are a real plus. Good product and good value. Good strength gains with no issues. I take a scoop in the am, then 1-2 scoops pre/post training. I got a bad batch the 1st time I tried the product. The Vanilla Ice Cream smelled like rancid, sour, spoiled milk! BB.com has amazing customer service and immediately sent me another tub (I sent the 1st 1 back). I usually order vanilla in everything, but I would caution people about THIS vanilla. It is really strange. If you are very taste and smell sensitive, I would try a different flavor (or get a small sample 1st). I never order chocolate in anything, but I tried the 5 serving Chocolate Decadence in Stacked and it is VERY tasty. Actually a treat, rather than a chore, to drink. The Cookies and Cream is also good, but not as tasty as the Chocolate.\n",
      "I was looking for a blend protein when i tried this. It is really great overall.\n",
      "Mixes well\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate taste great. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vanilla taste really bad, one of those few times when i could even take a sip. Really really bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "i would recommend.\n",
      "It's a good protein for a good price.\n",
      "Not only does it taste good, it has a high end blend of protein and ingredients to help you recover.\n",
      " first of all, I'm glad they sell a variety pack so I could try it before I buy a big one. Other protein makers could learn from evolution nutrition. \n",
      " Each one mixed very well and the flavors were great!  But unfortunately, they all had a chemical aftertaste as well. If they can do something to get the chemical taste out of their proteins, I will definitely switch to theirs! \n",
      "Very tasty and helpful my body is growing at a fast speed lifting 5 times a week and gaining about 10 pounds a month  very helpful love this item!\n",
      "Actually taste like cookies and cream with a good protein blend\n",
      "I recommend this product 100%. very happy with the taste. its a complete protein.\n",
      "This is a great protein.  Good amount of protein per scoop with low calories.  Chocolate peanut butter is good, with the cookies and cream right there in taste.  I just tried a cookies n cream by muscle tech, and it is no where near the good flavor of evlution.  great product!\n",
      "EVL hit it big with Stacked Protein. It mixes easily without a shaker cup. All the flavors are just as amazing not one flavor has let me down and taste great with simply water. Let's not forget it does great as a meal replacement! If you're tired of your protein shakes and needing a switch up I recommend you give Stacked Protein a try definitely worth every penny.\n",
      "It's okay. It mixes very well but I'm not a fan of the flavors that I've tried other than chocolate peanut butter. \n",
      "Mixes great and is pretty tasty with milk or water. Also great value. I highly recommend.\n",
      "Yum!  Great tasting protein in all the flavours I tried, and mixes very well with water in just a shaker cup.  Adding a little less water makes for a thicker shake - still without any lumps at all.  Seriously, this is probably my fave brand of protein out of all of the ones I've tried.  I love the stack - getting those BCAAs in there is fantastic.  Try it - you can't go wrong with this one.\n",
      "I have tried other protein shake powders and while I do like them, they tended to be a bit chalky.  When I saw EVLUTION NUTRITION was coming out with protein powder I was a bit excited and a bit hesitant because it was new but considering I have tried both their BCAA and pre-workout products I gave it a try.  I got no chalky texture and the flavors I tried were great, even my wife enjoyed them.  My only thing was that the cookies and cream tasted a bit to sweet for me. I will continue to purchase this product.\n",
      "EVL products are the best! The protein flavors are amazing. Vanilla is my favorite but the chocolate decadence and cookies and cream and great also. There are no fillers in their powder and it is a great protein to help me recover and build muscle. Thanks EVL for the amazing products.\n",
      "I absolutely love this protein powder! The chocolate peanut butter is so far my absolute favorite. Can't wait to try the other flavors! \n",
      "The vanilla taste just like a milk shake so good! I will be getting more soon \n",
      "Dont like the taste. Kinda bland without anything else added. Really smooth mix though. Keep me feeling ...not full but content until i can get to my post workout meal.\n",
      "Great taste and mixes easily. Like the mix of protein sources. The promo from BB.com and EVL made this a great bargain and I will be trying some of their other supplements.\n",
      "Chocolate flavor taste great! I had no problems with mixing this protein at all. This is a great blend as it also includes 5g of BCAA and 5g of glutamine which are essential after a workout.\n",
      "Can't complain at all about this product! generally I take it straight up with water but for some added taste using almond milk is great. I usually take it before and after my workouts as well as one before bed. Would definitely recommend it to friends and will be continuing to buy this product! The EVL brand is great all around! \n",
      "Pretty good powder taste great mixes well will buy again\n",
      "Choc. Peanut Butter didn't taste anything like the name to my wife and I. The choc. decadence was pretty good, but it's hard for me to give high taste reviews after tasting BSN Syntha-6. This has glutamine and BCAA's but I honestly couldn't tell a difference compared to ones that didn't have it. Not a bad product, but not my first choice. Not sure what else I can say...I didn't notice any difference in my workout/recovery and the taste was just average.\n",
      "Great Protein. Chocolate Decadence is probably the best tasting Chocolate Protein I've had. Mixes great in my nutribullet or in a shaker with Water or Almond Milk. Had everything you need in a single serving.  EVL makes great products, and with BB.coms prices and promos you can't go wrong.\n",
      "Seems to mix sell and perfom good so far but the flavor is a bit lacking. \n",
      "I took advantage of a great deal and decided to give stacked protein a chance. I'm glad that I did. It mixes easy, no clumping. You get a nice pretty thick (depending on amount of water used) shake and it goes down smooth. All 3 flavors I tried taste great. If you're looking for a good blended protein to help you meet your daily needs or to chug after a workout then I suggest you try stacked protein!  \n",
      "This is a fantastic all around protein. With a great blend of both fast and slow digesting proteins this is a great option for any time of the day you need to get in a little extra protein or just simply don't have time for a real meal. The amino profile on this protein is also excellently put together. The flavors are delicious. There's no other word for it. The vanilla ice cream and chocolate decadence are the only ones I've tried because they're so good I can't seem to not keep getting them. If you haven't experienced the difference EVL products can make in your nutrition and training regime, then you're missing out big time\n",
      "One of the best proteins on the market.\n",
      "Mixes great with everything and taste is on point. Gets great results in short period of time. Highly recommend!!!!\n",
      "Product has good ingredients but made me sick to my stomach. I have tried other proteins and this never happened. \n",
      "I love EVL's line of protein. Granted its not as tasty as some of the others, but I really like the fact its not one of those \"in your face with heavy sucralose\" flavors. Too much sweet is just as bad as too muted. This one hits the mark flavor wise for me. Mixes awesome, and I don't have to take a handful of BCAA pills or some super-sweet BCAA post-drink concoction after a workout as this has them in it, +Glutamine which is spectacular.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this protein - very clean and has all the essential nutrients to build quality muscle or help maintain - whatever your goal is. What I like the most is that one scoop (25G) mixes easily in about 6 oz of water. I also mix in in my oats in the morning and makes some tasty protein pancakes. Also, it provides your quick hitting whey protein and then also has casein protein to help keep them fed throughout the day or at night. Great product and I highly recommend.\n",
      "Glad i got the variety pack free because all the flavors in it had a chemical taste from the packaging. I have had the vanilla in a different container and it was fine (at least an 8).\n",
      "Very complete and well rounded protein...loaded with Glutamine and BCAA's!  It tastes pretty darn good too!\n",
      "\n",
      "LOVE this protein. It is one of the better tasting ones I've tried and mixes really well. I also can tell that it helps speed my recovery after a intense workout. One of my favorite for sure.\n",
      "Best tasting protein. I been putting it in a blender with a banana and strawberries and man is it good! DEFF TRY! \n",
      "\n",
      "Stacked Protein is a great protein with a variety of fast intermediate and slow digesting proteins. Mutability is great and no added amino fillers. I use this product three times a day, with breakfast as well as before and after training. \n",
      "Love the product ingredients but the cookies n cream flavor isn't up to par with other proteins I've tried\n",
      "Not sure why everyone raves about evil products, and to be fair most companies can not duplicate a good chocolate peanut butter taste.  However, I find this product to be pretty chalky taste, mixes well, and a fair price.  Probably won't buy it again and will stick to Jym and Kage products as I normally do.   I just don't see how this product is above others, to me there is nothing that sets it apart from other brands. \n",
      "Update: I am changing my review score to 10/10... After my initial review, am EVL staff member contacted me as to my conserns. What a great experiance... I will always stick with a brand that stands behind their product, quality, and cares about their customers! Evolve with EVL...!\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial Review: I bought the EVL primarily because of the price point. As far as the flavor & mix ability, I am pleased. However, my one complaint is that the scoop is NOT the serving size! It is in fact smaller. Even if you have a heaping scoop full, it is still under weight. \n",
      "Taste just like a vanilla milk shake so amazing! \n",
      "It gets kinda frothy. Instead, I wish it was thicker.\n",
      "I bought this because it was on sale and I decided to give it a shot. The taste is great and it mixes very well with water in a glass or in a blender bottle. Good quality protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "probably the worst cookies n cream protein i have ever had.  barely tastes like the flavor.\n",
      "Protein Blends are what lead me to EVL. Research confirms that a blend outperforms just whey protein alone. In my opinion I believe EVL is heading in the right direction. I tried the the vanilla ice cream and it taste horrible.  I will try the other flavors, but the blend is the biggest positive for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This product is amazing. this is my first product review. I am a big fan of Evlution and when I found out they came out with a protein blend, I had to get my hands on it. I drink this at the end of my workout for the quick release of protein. But since I usually workout in the evening, the slow release is perfect. My favorite is the Cookies and Cream flavor. I've tried a few Cookies and Cream protein but this is by far the best tasting I've tried. I also love the Chocolate Peanut Butter one. I usually add a spoon of peanut butter to this because I really like peanut butter. The Chocolate is my least favorite of the three that I've tried. Definitely not chocolately enough for me. But I have a sweet tooth so it may be good to others. Overall, this product is perfect for my needs and I can definitely feel the difference. \n",
      "Hate to be repetitive but this stuff seriously tastes great! Both flavors(chocolate decadence and chocolate peanut butter cup) are great mixed in a shake with fruit postworkout, taste excellent in plain Greek yogurt and cottage cheese as a protein pudding, and amazing as a standalone shake with almond milk or water. I definitely recommend and will be purchasing again and hope the other flavors are just as delicious.\n",
      "Good product. Mixes easily tastes good. Very satisfied.\n",
      "Great all around protein powder. I take this towards the end of my day as my second serving protein shake. Choco PB hit the spot!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great protein, I've definitely gain some lean muscle, great taste, mixes well and love that it's low in carb and fat.  Which allows me to supplement with it more.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best tasting protein powder I have ever had (and I have had a lot of different kinds!) It blends well, no clumps at all, not gritty like some powders, and it is thick like a milk shake. Delicious!!!!\n",
      "I have completely made the switch over to EVL. They make top shelf products. I will not be going back to other brands. The company is awesome with its client base. Very fast and very helpful. Not to mention the results. It is all around great. I am seeing really good progress with this stacked with the BCAA's and leanmode\n",
      "This stuff is great. Mixes very easily leaving no clumps. It does seem to mix on the thicker side of things, making it more of a milkshake consistency but I love that. Hands down one of the best proteins I've tried. I can't wait to try more of the flavors. You can't go wrong with this protein.\n",
      "This is not the first product by EVL I have had the pleasure of using. I am a huge advocate for their products, especially EGN! However, their protein powders are just as wonderful of a product as their pre-workout. Much like all of their protein powders, the vanilla flavor tasted delicious. It tastes much better than similar protein powders. This protein powder mixes easily and tastes great. As for taste, I give it a 10/10. It reminds of of a milk shake, which is a nice great. If you are wondering, this protein powder also comes with the scoop, so you can accurately measure how large a serving is. One of the most important factors of this protein powder is that it does not leave me with protein related cramps or stomach discomfort. This is HUGE to those like myself who lift and know what it's like to have to suffer throughout the day in the name of gains because of bad protein powders.\n",
      "This was recommended to me by a bodybuilder who works at my local gym.His friend backed him up and also recommended it. I'm seeing excellent results with it, so far. I'm becoming much leaner, and building muscle more quickly than I have in the past. I think it taste great. I mix it with plain almond milk sometimes, but even when I just use water it still taste really good . I've had it with skim milk, too. That was also yummy. I've even mixed it with iced coffee, and it wasn't bad. I actually find the flavor to be better with just 6 ounces of water. 8 was too watery for me. I can't wait to try the other favors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I workout hard and always take a Whey Protein shake after my workout to replenish my muscles. I am always looking for a new product to try out so I ordered this  Protein. It has been 6 days and am happy with this powder, especially that it is low carb. My body is feeling replenished and nourished after I have tested my body by pushing it to its limits. I am glad to know I am also not losing my lean muscle but building it. The taste is also great and satisfying to drink. There were negative side effects to this protein, I will definitely be re-ordering \n",
      "i have 5 tubs of evlution nutrition 2lb stacked protein, 3 cookies and cream, 1  chocolate peanut butter, and 1 vanilla ice cream! I love the taste and it mixes well with both water and 2% reduced fat milk. I take 2-3 scoops a day and i love what its doing for me, evl nutrition is my go to brand and i highly recommend it, its money well spent. when i'm running low i will invest in the 4lb tubs for sure! \n",
      "Hello all,\n",
      "Have been a big fan of ELV since its preworkout so I decided to give the new Stacked Protein a try. Great that my favorite supplement company now makes my favorite preworkout and protein! The cookies and cream flavor tastes and mixes very well so far with both water and almond milk. Mixed it into my protein shake too and it was great. Another hit product for EVL\n",
      "I like the taste allot, seems to be working so far I got a trial just to try.\n",
      "It is a great protein powder great tasting and very minimal of bloating. I guess it's like any other protein when it comes to bloating. I would recommend this to my friends. Well I buy it again yes only if its on sale again.\n",
      "I've used various protein powders on the market, and Evlution Stacked Protein is one of the best I've tried! I really appreciate the multiple types of proteins included for absorption timing, and the additional bcaa's to complete the package. One of my favorite aspects about this protein is how thick it gets with just water and ice! Typically I need to add half of a banana and almond milk to get that same consistency. The flavor in my opinion is just right, which is tasty without being too sweet. The carbs might be slightly higher than I prefer when I'm back in contest prep, but overall the quality is worth it. \n",
      "I just tried this protein powder this month, and I must say I totally love the vanilla ice cream flavor - it is spot on.  I thoroughly enjoy all the protein blends that are now out on the market.  If you are looking for a new protein to try then I'd recommend this one.  It doesn't mix as well as some others if you don't shake it for a while, but the shaking is worth it!  I hope you give it a shot and please let me know what you think if you do! \n",
      "This was a decent middle of the road protein blend, but I noticed nothing special about it except a sulfur smell that seems unique to this product. \n",
      "My boyfriend uses all EVL products so I had tried chocolate decadence before. I was excited to order the chocolate peanut butter as a surprise for him. It mixes easily whether I use water or milk and does not have a gritty or chalky texture like some other proteins out there. It is a low fat, low calorie protein source and the delayed release seems to help me feel full hours after I consume it. I would give EVL stacked protein two thumbs up and recommend it to anyone looking to try a new protein. My boyfriend always talks about how awesome EVL products are and how the company gives out samples to try of all their products. I think that is awesome and will recommend EVL to others in the future. \n",
      "First off, I buy protein for its nutritional benefits and taste is not that big of a deal to me. This protein seems legit plus the 5g of BCAAs and 5g of Glutamine really assist with recovery. This is my night time protein and I take 1 1/2 scoops mixed with milk before bed. This protein has really helped me recover after a long Jiu Jitsu training session and it also helps me recover quick enough for a heavy lift the next day. The vanilla taste is different and more like butterscotch but it isn't bad. I will be buying this protein again especially with the bogo deal.\n",
      "The ingredients are pretty good for a moderately priced protein, although being a blend would leave me wanting isolate a little higher on the list. It mixes VERY well. However, this is by far one of the LEAST favorable tasting protein mixes I've tried. I can not believe how many people have been raving about the taste. Both flavors I tried had a chemical smell and a lingering after taste. The flavors were so far off the mark I will not buy them again.\n",
      "I absolutely love both of these flavors, more so the vanilla. Mainly because I love making pancakes and protein bars with it!! It mixes very well and still taste amazing even mixed with water. Also love how it has BCAAs to help with muscle growth, I can't wait to try the other flavors! All around great product! \n",
      "Great recovery, nutrition facts are amazing! i just did not like the xantham gum it makes the taste really thick but thats just a personal preference. overall, great protein i would recommend!\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently bought this protein from bodybuilding.com, Overall its a great protein stacked with stuff like 5g of Glutamine and BCAA's. The taste is great and it mixes extremely well. Honestly one of the best proteins you can buy for the price\n",
      "This stuff tastes really, really good. Not only that, but it helps. I take it every night right before going to bed and it works wonders. Well, as much as any other protein, but compared to other protein mixes, this one is by far my favorite. Definitely would recommend it.\n",
      "Great product, great company. I will constantly buy from them. The taste is spot on and the gains so far have been great!\n",
      "I bought this because it was on sale for a very reasonable price. I normally buy BSN Syntha 6 but decided to give this a shot since I've been happy with EVL's pre workout and GLU+ for a long awhile now. This did NOT disappoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "VERY mixable and it tastes very well. Sometimes I have it with water and other with almond milk. It has a chocolate ice cream taste to it. Better tasting than most of the other protein products out there. I normally take 2 scoops before the workout and then one afterwards with a banana and it doesn't leave me feeling bloated. It's only been a week but I'm enjoying this so far and will post an update once I finish the tub. \n",
      "Fell in love with this company due to other products I have used before. Now I'm not a big chocolate fan in general especially when it comes to protein powders but the Chocolate Peanut Butter is on point for me.  Not too sweet and doesn't have an awkward aftertaste.  Mixes well with water or your choice of milk I've used both whole and coconut. PS It's like a milkshake w/ coconut milk, adds just a hint of extra sweetness.\n",
      "Will be buying more when needed and looking forward to other flavors purchased.\n",
      "This protein is nice because it's broken down to more than just standard protein which breaks down and is synthesized at a faster pace. This protein helps with having slower synthesized protiens in it as well. This helps that all protein isn't broken down as quickly and is either stored or excreted! \n",
      "Chocolate Decadence is AWESOME!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Vanilla Ice Cream is HORRIBLE. It's not Maple that it tastes like, it's BUTTERSCOTCH....WTH????\n",
      "\n",
      "Please take this back and send me the Chocolate Decadence.\n",
      "Great Stuff, especially for the price. I have heard good things about Stacked Protein, boy the rumors were true. Flavor was great,  was interesting, but it has what looked like little bits of cookies. I thought that was so cool. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this is a great protein, I recommend it to everyone. I never knew I could get a cookies and cream flavored protein...I'm so glad I found Evlution Nutrition.\n",
      "I found this protein quite good. I bought the sample pack to try out some of the flavors and the protein itself. It mixes perfectly with about 10-20 seconds of shaking. I had 0 chunks of protein with very minimum effort. The taste was definitely better than normal. I bought MP new combat formula ( if it really is new) and this one blows that out of the water. Definitely worth the try of the sample pack if you don't want to commit to a 2lb or a 4lb tub.\n",
      "I have tried several brands of powder, and this is without question my favorite. The taste is better than almost all I have tried, it blends absolutely great in just a blender bottle (milk or water!). I have noticed a huge difference since taking this (2 scoops w/ approx. 14 ounces of milk). When taken in the morning right after waking up, I don't find myself wanting to snack all day. Sure, I do get hungry for lunch, but I have no real desire to snack before or after like I always have in the past. I no longer need to consume 3-4 shakes a day as I had with other brands. I am totally satisfied (hunger and muscle recovery) with one in the morning and one post workout.\n",
      "Hands down, best protein out there, and fair priced! \n",
      "Great protein. Does everything protein needs. fuels my muscles completely after workouts. Cookies and cream tastes great. Tastes a little different than other cookies and cream proteins but that's not a bad thing. Can't wait to try other flavors. Great protein at a great price.\n",
      "This protein tastes awesome! It has a good blend of protein sources for growth. You can't beat the price right now either. Evlution nutrition is one one best companies out there. They truly care about their customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered two 4lb tubs of this after being very impressed by the added Glutamine and BCAAs. Finally arrived, and I love it. I've had trouble in the past with bad-mixing protein powders, but this stuff mixes up nicely even just with a few shakes. The chocolate flavor is pretty **** good as far as protein powders go. Very impressed all-around, going to be ordering again. \n",
      "Overall this protein is good with little gas and bloating that you sometimes get from other multiple source protein powder's. On taste, The Vanilla Ice Cream is terrible. It should be called maple flavored because that is all you can smell or taste with this flavor. My son feels the same way about the flavor of this protein. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE FIX YOU VANILLA FLAVOR AND MAYBE I'LL PURCHASE AGAIN! \n",
      "I absolutely love this new Stacked Protein! It's macros are on point and the flavour profile is excellent! I highly recommend this product! Keep up the great work EVLUTION NUTRITION!\n",
      "I love this protein! It mixes better than most protein powders I've tried and the flavor (chocolate decadence) is delicious and tastes similar to a good quality hot chocolate mix, it's delicious. A lot of chocolate flavors with protein powders end up tasting fake or chalky and this one doesn't at all! Perfect consistency and taste! The build of it is also excellent, hence the 'stacked' name, no need to make several different mixes of glutamine and BCAAs, it's all in this protein! I definitely found my new favorite protein!!\n",
      "Got this a couple days ago along with a deal so I decided to try Evl protein. I've stuck with 1 brand pretty much but had to get this. It's a little bit thicker than my last protein but still shakes up pretty well and tastes good with water or milk. Will probably buy a 4lb tub after I'm finished with this 2lb! Definitely would tell my buddies about this. Their preworkout is great too. Green apple to be specific!\n",
      "I think I found my new favorite protein powder, and I have tried almost all of them!  \n",
      "Absolutely love this protein!  Nutrient profile is perfect for me.  Mixes easily and I was very surprised with the texture...it was so smooth!  Chocolate Decadence was a unique chocolate flavor and unlike every other chocolate protein I have tasted...I'm not exactly sure how to explain it, but it was \"creamy\"?  Looking forward to ordering more and trying other flavors.  Way to go Evlution!\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent product! Love the taste and very effective. \n",
      "First time using this product and so far works great \n",
      "\n",
      "Like others have said, becomes very clumpy in a few days even when stored in a cool and dry place. There is a packet of silica gel in there but it doesn't seem to alleviate the problem. Taste is very sour and requires a lot of water to dilute to a bearable taste. Otherwise mixes well and as effective as any other l-carnitine I have tried. Sadly to say, I won't be buying this again until there are better flavours and clumping issues are sorted. Will be buying RSP capsules in my next batch.\n",
      "I've tried both flavors of the Carnigen and absolutely love them both. I'm sitting at 187 and 9% BF right now so I'm loving my progress from all their products I'm taking currently. \n",
      "This product REALLY surprised me.... Not only did it work..... It worked even better and quicker than I had expected! The improvement in my physique has been dramatically noticeable!\n",
      "\n",
      "(Side Note: Personally, I'm not really sure what this \"clumpy\"ness and moisture stuff others are all talking about... My product is perfectly fine and still mixes well in water)\n",
      "\n",
      "I started off drinking just one scoop per day 30 mins before training to see what it tastes like and how my body would handle it. Then I moved to one scoop during the day and another scoop 30mins before my workout. Now I'm doing 2 scoops during the day and 2 scoops 30mins before my workouts.. and maaaaannnn ohhhhh mannnnn did Carnigen deliver!\n",
      "\n",
      "Works for me :) Give it a try!\n",
      "Taste was good, it worked ok but product will no stand humidity, moisture kills it, I live in a humid weather so I won't be able to use it again. \n",
      "Product has arrived perfect and taste was great. However, after only a few days the product became clumpy and full of moisture. It was definitely the product as I had ordered 2 containers through a promotional sale and the second container did the exact same thing. I wouldn't order it again.\n",
      "Hard to say if this product was good when I got it. It was in clumps. & not fresh. As though moisture had gotten into it. This is unusual for Evogen, I have purchased & used glycoject Evp & cell KEM many times & been extremely pleased.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend this to anybody that is looking to get a good sweat for their morning cardio or regular workout. I sweat so much using this, I know that this is just using whatever fat I have and burning it off. The taste is amazing. It's so good that I take the scoop straight to the dome and then chase it with water. I like that super sweet taste. I would recommend taking this with evogen's other product lipocide to get the best shred stack to help you maximize your fat loss. \n",
      "THis gives you great energy in the morning and during my workouts! only issue is that it gave me an upset stomach sometimes but if you drink plenty of water after drinking it, it helps with that alot.\n",
      "Wow, taste of this product is amazing!!! I take 4 scoops and drink it during my workout with bcaa's, helped me drop 2%bf. Excellent product! \n",
      "Amazing flavor\n",
      "Have only been using this for about a week and already have seen significantly faster results. Flavor is absolutely amazing too, I could drink a ton of it!\n",
      "\n",
      "awesome all round!! \n",
      "\n",
      "I love this product. I have previously only tried L-Carnitine in pill form. With this Carnigen I can mix it with my aminos to drink during my workout. I love mixing the cherry-limeaide flavor with my watermelon flavored aminos! I feel like I have more energy and I get a great pump!\n",
      "This is my 2nd batch of Carnigen, awesome for my cardio days (3 days a week 20 to 25 mins) I have incorporated it in my fasted cardio and HIIT training and yes it does act like a pre-workout just for cardio will i buy it again yes i use 2 full scoops very please\n",
      "Absolutely love this stuff. Just ordered my second batch. Along with my bpi muscle gaining stack!\n",
      "Taste great! This has been my go to for fasted cardio. great product\n",
      "Amazing product. Just got it for the first time last week and I'm loving it. It does exactly what it says and the flavor is well, interesting in a good way. The powder smells like some old school cotton candy bubblegum like bubbalicious that I don't think is available anymore unless you go to a candy specific store. When it gets mixed with water it tastes like a lemonade flavor. Highly recommend easy 10/10 for me\n",
      "I like this product a lot, the taste is good, kind of tastes like a gummy bear. I like the fact that I can use it as a pick me up and it also kills the need for sweets. I drink it almost like BCAA's. I drink one in the morning then two servings prior to workouts. So far its working really well for me. To me Evogen always has good products and I was happy to see that this was decently priced.\n",
      "Finally something that really works! I have been using this supplement as intra during weight training and before cardio for about 7 weeks. I actually have gained weight but shrunk waistline. I am 43 so I'd say that's awesome as I had hit a plateau prior to this and also as I had hurt my knees I haven't been able to run for months which normally what I do to shred fat.\n",
      "The flavor is amazing and so are the results! I have lost 22 pounds now over the last two months and this is a big part of my success!\n",
      "I haven't used it often enough to give a credible review on it's effectiveness since I only use it twice per week before my fasted cardio, but the taste is good. I got the Raspberry Lemonade flavor.\n",
      "Awesome product !!!!\n",
      "I am a big fan of L- carnitine :) Carnigen enhanced my cardio portion of the workout, makes me sweat like crazy and warm up for the rest of the training.  Also will be trying Lipocide by Evogen, will let you know how it works together!\n",
      "Probably the most complete Carnitine supp out there!\n",
      "It has 4 different Carnitine sources plus the bioperine to enchance the bioaviability. The price is also pretty solid for 90 doses. It really does its job getting that extra energy from fat burning. The taste is also great!\n",
      "Evogen Carnigen is a Must Have .. Ive been using this product for 2 mths and have seeen Great Changes with Lean Muscle Mass and That extra Boost to push harder through my Workouts .. Great Product !!\n",
      "This product was incredible. Over the span of four weeks, I lost about 4% body fat, and about 16 lbs. overall! It's taste is great, and it's not a hassle or a tedious supplement to take. I stacked it with Pyro Pro made by bodybuilding.com, and the effects were awesome. I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "Great taste and incredible results using thus far!\n",
      "Great taste. Mixes awesome in 3oz of water. No jitters. Sustained energy. Mental focus. Shreds fat. Love it. Will start stacking now for new season.\n",
      "Great pump and recovery supplement.\n",
      "I use it as intra and post workout.\n",
      "I can truly tell a difference in muscle size after starting to use this product. Recovery is exceptional. It also mixes fantastically like other aminos. Awesome product. An essential to my supp stack!\n",
      "Wanted to try this line out to see what the hype is all about. Dude, save your money and stop being  a supplement *****, with your fake *** gains. \n",
      "Great recovery products. \n",
      "Great recovery, fuller muscles (surprised me), more strength. It does what its supposed to do. \n",
      "I've had a little water retention in the abdomen area only, but nothing extreme (I always get that with creatine, to varying degrees). \n",
      "Tastes REALLY GOOD (raspberry lemonade) and its by far the best mixing post workout I've had.\n",
      "No stomach issues (and I have a sensitive one that fs me from time to time).\n",
      "\n",
      "Evogen products are great but their taste factor is really bad.  I am using the fruit punch cell kem and it's ok at best tasting.\n",
      "By far the best post recovery supplement out there. I always take it right after I workout and recovery time is a lot faster. It sucks when I run out cuz I would have to order more and those days I don't take it, I can tell the difference... and it's not a mental thing either. All flavors and tastes are amazing but my favorite is the tropical mango. You will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Cell KEM. one of the b est tasting supplements i have and and mixes so well! It helped me recover much faster and also helped me sustain a sick pump during my whole workout! highly reccomended to all! Dont forget it also contains BCAA;s\n",
      "Cell Kem is actually one of the products that got me into using Evogen Products. The flavor of the pineapple guava is by far the best tasting drink i have had. Ive mixed it with watermelon Glycojet for intra workout and it was crazy how good it tastes. I almost forgot i was on prep! it definitely helps me with recovery and whenever i run out, its an absolute must to restock. some other products i will let linger and no rush to restock, but this is not one of those.\n",
      "Best work out recovery hands down! Allows you to work out multiple days in a row without feeling too sore or beat down! Used this religiously and have seen incredible progress and recovery. I highly recommend this it should be a staple in your supplements. Take immediately after your lift, carry it in you gym bag. If you do post work out cardio take it before. Will never go without it! \n",
      "\n",
      "I had to share my experience because this is the best recovery product I ever used. I take it after training and mix it with my protein shake.  \n",
      "The taste is really good ( never took it alone though, only mixed with chocolate flavor protein) and the recovery is amazing. I used to be tired from training the day after but since I started taking this I feel really refreshed, rested and ready to go hard again the next day. \n",
      "My fatigue has disappeared and even mid-day I feel full of energy, It doesn't affect my sleep if fact it does nothing much to change your sleeping patterns. \n",
      "So I recommend this one, it really helped me a lot!\n",
      "Best postworkout I've ever used. Keeps me full during the day. Great taste. Immediately noticed that it kept my muscles full.\n",
      "tastes good- recovery is great- what more can I ask for? \n",
      "It's drinkable at best as far as flavor goes and I'd say two scoops is a must for everyone given the dosing per serving, which changes the price per serving significantly.  All in all a decent product but pricey and under dosed for those lol in for gains in muscle mass.\n",
      "I like the tropical mango better, even though they both taste good only with a slight \"medicine\" taste. So if you are sensitive to that you may not like it. I don't mind it as much, as it reminds me that I'm adding fuel to my bodies \"muscles\". \n",
      "As far as results, I am still very much a work in progress. I'm slowly toning up, getting stronger & gaining muscle mass. My workouts include a variety of strength training, muscle building & cardio moves. \n",
      "Cell KEM aids in my recovery, I am able to hit the gym hard the next day without the effects of DOMS. \n",
      "I have used this product for the first time for the past 30 days. I stacked it with Evogen EVP pre-workout supplement. This product is very good. My soreness and fatigue after lifting, even after increasing my weights, has been significantly reduced with this product. I take scoop immediately after workout, and on occasional days that I have worked extra splits, I take a scoop before sleep. I would suggest this product to anyone who pushes themselves in their workouts (lifting or cardio).\n",
      "Keeps me looking Full!\n",
      "I confidently use and highly recommend Cell K.E.M for your post workout! I use this consistently and love how it helps promote my gains and helps with recovery time. When I first started training for my competition, I did not know about Evogen's recovery solution and once I found out I knew I had to try it! The difference was major and helped me go harder from day to day as my recovery was much more progressive and kept me right on track! Highly recommend!\n",
      "Hands down the best post workout supplement. Yes, it's higher in price but you get what you pay for. You are definitely getting a lot of quality with this product!\n",
      "To start off with, I'm not sponsored by Evogen (yeah cause I'm skinny) and I purchased this with my own money not as a free tester.  Sadly Ive been weight lifting for about 8 years (and I'm still skinny, just less skinny) but probably only the last 3 years or so Ive actually been researching and working out intelligently.  My workout is a 2 day, 2x a day program which is giving me great results but also results in incredible soreness.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, this is a great post workout product.  Most days after a workout I'm very fatigued after my workouts (I've never had that post workout burst of energy everyone always talks about...).  I bought this and have been taking it for about a month now and the difference post workout is pretty significant.  My 1st and 2nd day DOMS are just minor irritants now and as long as I remember to take this immediately after working out I have energy (not caffeinated jittery energy) for the rest of the day.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As far as flavor goes, I got the mango flavor... it mixes well but the flavor is only OK, not great, but also not chalky throw-up bad\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm currently taking the following: Combat powder, Cellucor ZMA (night recovery), Evogen Glycoject (intraworkout), Cell K.E.M. (Post) and a GNC Men's Multi.\n",
      "Evogen makes all of my favorite products! Cell KEM provides superior recovery and muscle fullness. I don't \"lose my pump\" right after I finish my workout. With Cell KEM I keep my muscle fullness throughout the day. Not to mention, it tastes great!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Best post workout supplement\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste great. I've used it for almost 30 days now. I can't see any real noticeable difference other than constancy in muscle hardness. But this stuff is ok.\n",
      "Again it's the best, love it...\n",
      "Truly one of my favorite products!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best recovery product I've ever used! I am in love with the mango! Being a powerlifter I need as much help as I can to recover so I can kill it my next training session. This has definitely allowed me to do that!\n",
      "Hands down the best recovery product on the market! Gets me through every workout!\n",
      " ve this product was second guessing at first took me a while but i finally made the switch an let me say its well worth it my second day on it, usually im sore bad the next day but with this my muscles feel relaxed an pumped great product will never switch off of this.\n",
      "Love this after my workouts!  Keeps my pump going, tastes great and I'm hardly sore!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Main thing i noticed was less overall soreness in a trained muscle group,  it goes down easy mixed in with my creatine and glycofuse. Overall ive ordered my second tub and will continue to use thumbs up. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CELL KEM works wonders, it is the only product that has helped me keep my pump and size after my workout. Very thankful that I was introduced to this by my coach Jonathan Irizarry. The new tropical mango flavor is very addicting... I even freeze it to make it the perfect popsicle after a heated workout..!!\n",
      "Best recovery agent on the market.  The taste and quality of Cell K.E.M. is simply unmatched.\n",
      "Excellent recovery and stamina \n",
      "Does exactly what it say's and\n",
      " like anything do your research and you'll truly \n",
      "Know what you get what you pay for...\n",
      "Great product!\n",
      "This is my favorite pre and post workout drink. It tastes great and has helped me build muscle.\n",
      "Havent noticed to much from this. i due notice i am more fuller for longer! havent noticed size increase or lose so i would say its good for maintaining\n",
      "Over rated and way over price.\n",
      "Cell KEM is awesome,  I love taking it post workout, taste is awesome and the Evogen products are all top notch.  This is in my 'go to' stack for post workout and helps keep me feeling full and pumped. \n",
      "THE BEST POST WORKOUT IN THE WORLD\n",
      "I use the Evogen products strictly and regularly.  Cell KEM in the morning, after a workout, and before bed while also utiliizing the Glucoject before and after workouts and the EVP before a workout.  In addition to the recovery time acceleration, a fullness and high energy during a workout, and the motivation to give it my all in the gym is noticed with these products.  I have never had a line of products give me such fantastic results so quickly before.  Although somewhat pricey, buying the Glucoject, EVP, and Cell Kem stack is definitely worth it and I highly recommend it to anybody who takes their hard workouts seriously.  \n",
      "This **** smells GREAT. But it doesn't taste anywhere near as good. But that's a minor detail that isn't really important. What's important is that I've cycled this and it hasn't done anything more than your run-of-the-mill BSN AminoX. So, because of that, not worth the $50. Save your money.\n",
      "This product is sweet! tastes and smells awesome. helps with my workout recovery(ALL OVER)! Makes my muscles feel full and stronger like they were before and i'm feeling stronger. Muscles are defined also. EVOGEN seems to be a solid brand. Cost seems to be a bit high but oh well.\n",
      "Great product that works.\n",
      "This is hands down the best recovery product out there. It has the highest quality BCAAs and Glutamine out there. Its not loaded with fillers or any extra junk like alot of other recovery products have. Just has everything u need. Taking this product literally cuts my recovery time in half. Its a little pricey but u get what u pay for. If u r gonna put something in ur body, it should be the highest quality possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste great, awesome recovery when mixed with some Creature .\n",
      "I've been taking cell K.E.M. upon waking up, and immediately after my workouts 20 minutes before I drink my protein shake. I noticed that it helps a lot with recovery, even more than whey. The taste is great and it shakes up no problem. It is a little pricey for only 400 grams, but it is worth the money. When I take this after my workout, I want to go straight back to the gym! Great product and will buy again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of all Pre and Post workout Powders I have been amazed by how great Evogen's quality is on all there lines. Thank You Evogen!\n",
      "Well this is a very good product from my personal opinion i take it right after my last set and my recovery is great i don't know if it's because I'm also taking glutamine and animo sports 4500 fist thing in the morning but so far so good. Taste wise is drinkable it has an after taste but other than that very good product\n",
      "Have only been using this supplement for a few weeks now for post work out recovery. So far I've found it works very well, gives a good post work out pump and just a general all over solid feeling. Also help post workout soreness, I don't have ANY after using this product! Taste is a little strange, not bad, but not altogether amazing tho... Will def. continue to use if it keeps giving me this effect. Will update this review if I get any negative effects.\n",
      "I have been using this along with Evogen EVP and I am pleased with the pump, muscle hardness, and strength with this product. The effect lasts all day after workouts and even on off days. I know others are saying that the list of ingredients is not that sophisticated, but who cares. I am not writing a thesis in chemistry, I am working out and this stuff works. Period. I highly recommend it for post workouts.\n",
      "Hany has hit another homerun with Cell KEM. I tried the original EVO and now use EVP and the two products together are incredible. If you use something else put it down and order this immediately because it is designed for the fitness community and those that want to achieve the ultimate physique.\n",
      "I have been using Cell KEM for a few weeks now and love this new product. Training for figure contests puts a lot of stress on my body so I take one scoop after my workout for recovery. I look and feel great plus the fruit punch flavor is really good!\n",
      "Another great product!! I love it!\n",
      "I was really excited to be able to try out this brand especially with a lot of the positive reviews. I unfortunately did not have the same experience as many of the others did. The taste was by far the worst tasting supplement I have ever had. I tried it first with the recommended amount of water than with less then with more. Same soap-tasting experience. I also was not overly excited with the performance of the supplement, therefore this was the first supplement I have needed to ever return. I hope others have better success with the product.\n",
      "After using and sampling a variety of pre workouts and supplements, I can honestly say Evogen is my favorite company. EVP Plus is superior to other pre workouts because of the mental focus it gives. While doing excercises in front of a mirror, I am so zoned in on myself everyone around me appears blurry. I am completely focused on my breathing and mind muscle connnection when taking it. For me, that is key. It definitely doesn't give you the crazy stimulant energy from products like Dyno or Mr.Hyde but what it will provide you with is the focus and pump to break through platueaus. I've been taking evogen supplements for 2 weeks and I don't think I will ever buy any other kind. If you are looking for a clean, high quality product that really builds mind muscle connection and helps you break through to the next phase, EVP plus all the way!\n",
      "works awesome especially mentally.  I love taking before golf rounds.  The peach mango flavor is DISGUSTING in my opinion\n",
      "\n",
      "MY go-to for preworkout. Mental focus is incredible, Muscle pump, energy and connection has never been better. What I don't like about other preworkouts is they are full of proprietary blends and stimulants. Not EVPplus. Pure stuff that just out performs anything else. Looking for badass pumps, focus, muscle size and performance, you will not be disappointed. Evogen Nutritions EVPplus delivers!!\n",
      "I recommend this preworkout to anybody who needs a little kick from the caffeine but who also still wants to get a good night sleep if you had to get a late night workout in. That happened to me. I'm talking finishing a workout at 11pm at night and still being able to sleep right after. I know if I was on other preworkouts, I wouldn't be able to go to sleep for a while... trust me, it's happened to me and I was so ******. Highly recommend to everyone.\n",
      "Evp Plus is my favorite pre work out on the  market. It gives me the best pump especially when i stack it with glycoject and lets me focus better than ever. I highly reccomend to someone who needs a new pre workout!\n",
      "this product gives me great prework out with out the crash\n",
      "I have an issue with pre workouts making me gag. I use this with BSN Syntha-6 banana flavor and it mixes and tastes perfect. I've gotten my best lifts using these two together. \n",
      "i was very excited to try EVP Plus. I really liked the first month, but my second bottle was on back order, so I had a bottle of White Flood as a back up for cases like this. When I got into my 2nd bottle, i wasn't as crazy for it as I did when I tried it the first time. So far Pre Jym is still #1 for me.\n",
      "Excellent product!\n",
      "love love love this product. gives me great energy and pump. I also take cell kem and glycoject and recently started taking the new isoject. i highly recommend all evogen products. top quality. \n",
      "I have always been a fan of pre-workouts. I love trying the newest and most popular to see how well it really works or if it's just another bust. Evogen's EVP Plus is by far my favorite and most effective pre workout! I usually stack it with other Evogen products such as Carnigen (carnitine) and Glycoject (carb matrix) to obtain maximum pumps, vascularity, and fullness, not to mention it's the best tasting on the market. I'll continue to use this because it consistently works I haven't built a tolerance to it like most other companies. \n",
      "This was the most expensive pre workout I have bought and it has been a let down. I will not be purchasing this again. \n",
      "The energy I receive from this product is enough to sustain me for an hour of heavy lifting AND 20 minutes of HIIT. The pump is ridiculous, and the taste is awesome...for me, peach mango wins because the taste is nice and smooth...almost like drinking a Nantucket Nectars. I also really like the raspberry lemonade, and it mixes well with the raspberry lemonade Carnigen. I am a HUGE fan of Evogen products, they really work! \n",
      "Thinking I was going to up my game and buy one of the most expensive pre workouts on the market with great ratings, what a let down. I didn't see any increase in energy levels and to top it off the taste sucks. If it worked, I would praise this product even if the flavor sucked but its bad all around. Will never ever buy this product again, over rated wanna be pre workout!!!!\n",
      "I really wanted this product to work, I hoped it would function well like the decent Geranium products we used to see a couple of years ago. I got this because of a recommendation, so presumably it worked for some, just not me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mixed the scoop as directed and drank the mix, went to the gym and started my workout and ...... nothing! Didn't get any of the desired effects of a preworkout, this product to me was basically an over sweetened sports drink rather than a powerhouse preworkout compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't recommend this product to anybody, it's really expensive too.\n",
      "one of the best pre workout that i have ever used amazing energy, pump and taste \n",
      "Another top-notch Evogen product. Best pre-workout on the market, by far. When you need that extra \"boost\" of energy, EVP Plus gives you just what you need, as well as providing you with stellar focus, improved performance, and insane muscle pumps. \n",
      "\n",
      "This pre workout from Evogen has been super awesome!!! The pump I get during my workouts are pure along with great focus and stamina. Before I used EVP PLUS I was using C4 and EVP really have me a better boost on my strength, and best of all, I don't get that itchy feeling like C4 gave me! EVP PLUS IS PURE GREATNESS! I highly recommend this over any other PWO! The taste grew on me a bit but still not a problem at all (I've only tried the mango flavor). Definitely worth the price!!! \n",
      "I love using the EVP Plus as my pre-workout everytime I go to the gym and/or do any type of cardio! This product gives me the perfect boost of energy and allows me to get that maximum pump for the best results in every workout! The flavor is amazing on both flavors offered and honestly stand strongly by the Evogen brand. Their supplements have helped me keep to and exceed my goals of living a healthy focused lifestyle and overall goals of competing in bikini division for NPC! If I am ever asked what products I use, I never hesitate for a second to highly promote and recommend Evogen! \n",
      "This is a great product! I take this during my evening workout around 5 and it has never interfered with my sleep. Love this pre workout. By far the best stuff out there. A quality product!\n",
      "I have been taking the EVP Plus for a few weeks now.  All in all I find it to be pretty good!  Taste on the other hand is mediocre, but that's just personal.  I've been cutting for 10 weeks now and it definitely gives me the energy I need to power thru my training.  I'm still lifting heavy and have even made a jump on a couple lifts.  One thing I noticed that's different from other pres is that I don't notice when it takes effect.  A weird observation, but just something that caught my attention.  In a nutshell, I would purchase this product again.  \n",
      "I have to say this is the best pre-work out I've tried. I've tried other such as C4, Pre JYM, Arnold, Epiq and they don't give me the focus, energy, or pump like EVP plus does. The Peach-mango flavor is awesome as well and mixes really well too.  I highly recommend EVP plus!\n",
      "Excellent pre workout. I never get a tingle or a flush feeling (which isn't necessarily good or bad, sometimes I really like to get the tingles or the flush feeling that lets you know your blood is really flowing and its go time) but I have been very satisfied with my performance when I use the EVP plus.   This is my second time buying it and over the course of the first tub I set personal bests in deadlift, squat, and bench press repeatedly over about a 6 week period. Strong finish, never felt completely exhausted after my workouts and never felt any type of crash. Not too much caffeine to keep me from sleeping either, and I'm pretty sensitive to caffeine late in the day. On top of all that the peach mango is hands down the best tasting pre workout I've ever had. No acidic after taste or anything. Definitely would recommend.  \n",
      "Taste is ok. Get great pumps but causes skin to break out.\n",
      "Great taste and mixes easily.  Makes for great workouts full of energy and focus, and the cool part is you're not looking like a freak shaking the whole time with the pre-workout jitters. :)  I would definitely use this product again. \n",
      "I initially tried EVP plus from samples at the 2014 LA Fitexpo. I got amazing pumps and great workouts from those samples. Like anyone else, I wanted to replicate the effects so I bought 2 tubs at bb.com soon after. I am not certain if the samples and the actual product's ingredient make-up changed, but I definitely did not get the same pumps. I understand it is very subjective, but I have 1 whole tub remaining that I probably will not waste my workouts on.\n",
      "Great focus, and pump. Just keeps you going through the whole workout. Leaves you feeling like you can do more. Usually would take it 15 min before like the bottle says.\n",
      "Tastes great, Great pump and not over stimmed like most pre-workouts\n",
      "I have been trying EVP Plus for a few weeks, here are my thoughts: The taste is great, but it doesn't mix easily with water. It clumps and doesn't dissolve evenly. Given the pleasant taste though, I can live with this. Lots of other reviewers mention \"killer pumps\". What? This hasn't been the case for me or my girl. Not saying it won't do this for you, just don't expect it. In terms of motivation and focus, the first couple of times I tried it, it was in the 8.5 range. Since then it has been a solid 7. Lots of other reviewers mention \"killer pumps\". What? This hasn't been the case for me or my girl. In the end, is it worth the premium price? \n",
      "No, not even close. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good WPI. Overpriced. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love all their products, and will be for a long time now. \n",
      "Mixes well, Made me very bloated. Chocolate Peanut butter tastes nothing like what it says it tastes like dirt.\n",
      "Great protein , this a very fine powder and the smell is legit. I have tried other protein brands  and this one by far is the best that has worked for me.  why? well it tastes good and it mixes very well , it does foam up but let it settle for 1 or 2 minutes and it's ready to drink.  Currently I am on weight loss plan and I find it easy to fit Isoject in my diet. I take this after my weight training routine and it is very easy on the stomach , no bloating no gas.  As far as price , its not bad considering this is an Isolate , plus evogen and BB is Kind enough to offer discounts , so cant beat that.   Works for me , Looking forward in trying other products by evogen.  \n",
      "I've tried many proteins and isoject is by far the cleanest whey protein you can get. Also, the flavors are amazing. If you like Reeces pieces, the chocolate peanut butter taste exactly the same. If you like eating Cinnabon, the cinnamon roll flavor tastes just like you ate something from there. All the flavors are so good, even my wife approves of this protein. All you need is water but to make it even taste more amazing, use vanilla almond milk. It taste so good you're gonna think that you're cheating on your diet. I recommend this protein to everybody who wants quality over quantity and who loves great tasting flavors. \n",
      "Protein's quality is really good. Taste was horrible!, i had to mix it with other stuff just to make it taste good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sampled each flavor at the exclusive max muscle in store launch and each protein flavor taste the way we all wish these companies would flavor their supplements. Is it expensive for the amount? Well if you don't mind buying the cheap protein spiked kind like optimum nutrition, dymatize, cellucore, allmax, isopure, ect then yea it's expensive. But talking to hanny himself, this stuff is the purest. The protein amount on the label is how much you're getting!!  Keep buying crap if you'd like. only down side is that its flavored with sucralose , wish they would use stevia.\n",
      "By far my absolute favorite protein powder. Where to start?? It mixes incredibly well, with no clumps whatsoever. I started off by purchasing Vanilla Bean, and usually I just suck it up and deal with the mild, dull flavors of protein powders; however, this protein lives up to their promise of a fantastic taste. I have used this protein in just a regular shaker bottle, as well as in a blender with other ingredients for a shake. Both methods are awesome, as well as delicious. As far as performance goes, I feel I have recently been able to recover quicker and can feel my performance rising in the gym. New dedicated customer right here! I would recommend this to any and everyone! So happy I've found the protein powder for me.\n",
      "I've been on IsoJect  twice per day for the past 3 weeks and I can't think of buying another protein.  Since beginning IsoJect protein I have noticed increased energy levels, muscle growth and quicker recovery ability.  As a NPC Bikini competitor it is so important I can recover and maintain healthy during each workout and IsoJect keeps me pumping.  In addition to IsoJect making me feel incredible, it's purity and taste is phenomenal!  The Chocolate Peanut Butter is the creamiest and most delicious protein I have tried.  The possibilities are endless with this protein because it bakes well, blends to milkshake quality and mixes without clumps.  I want results and this product gives me all the results I desire; all I can say is amazing!\n",
      "Pure deliciousness! I love this flavor and probably one of my new favorite protein brands! Does not make me bloat or anything either! My boyfriend even finds it tasty. \n",
      "Hands down the BEST protein powder I've ever used.  Amazing taste and mixes well. The best on the market!\n",
      "This protein powder is out of this world. No other protein compares to it. Not even close!! Best protein I've ever tasted. Vanilla bean tastes so good, and with 0 grams of sugar and only 1 gram of carb. This is by far the purest whey isolate out there. And the best. I saw a change in my body so quick that I had to order extra tubs of this! Never experienced anything like this from any other protein powder! Best one out there and is really worth your money.! I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting to gain muscle, or even stay lean. Very very great product with amazing ingredients and by far the purest. evogen! You guys did a great job! Will keep buying this protein!!\n",
      "The flavor of this protein is off the charts! Hands down the best, thickest, most flavorful WPI on the market. Love the fact that there is no soy, but Evogen needs to work on a larger size...Bring on the 4lb tub!\n",
      "Amazing stuff!  Tastes great, mixes smooth, extremely drinkable.  Extreme Nutrition really got this one right.  Loaded with protein and quality ingredients, no garbage or fillers.  Absolutely satisfied with the purchase and will absolutely, most definitely be buying this again, and again, and again.  \n",
      "The frosted churro flavor tastes good, and it's different than any other flavor of whey protein that I've tried. It's a good price, too.\n",
      "Not so much a Frosted Churro flavor. More of a creamy Cinnamon. Overall it mixes will and taste great. I would use when not-cutting. But overall a great product\n",
      "This is my official go-to protein! It's delicious. Doesn't have the typical artificial-sweetener taste that a lot of proteins have. It tastes awesome in water. It blends well with foods (I use it in oatmeal and baked goods). BEST OF ALL, it doesn't reek to the high heavens if you leave it in your shaker for a while. Would highly recommend the Cake Batter flavor. The Frosted Churro isn't so tasty. Haven't tried the Chocolate Milkshake.\n",
      "This product is amazing!!! Best thing I've used hands down! Love it.\n",
      "Huge fan of Finaflex Products to start.  I am 35, work full time, and work out part time... LoL \n",
      "Thought I would give a test boost a try. I am about 3 weeks in and love it. Nothing weird or funny happening to me and seems to have all the right ingredients in it when I was doing my own research. I take it in mornings on work days and before work out on work out days. I would definitely use again in the future.  I.G. @Travis.Ellis714\n",
      "The first day I tried this, I felt the difference between it and NOExplode I had been using. I had more energy, lifted more and longer, and even left the gym with energy to spare. 1 month later I still feel it is a great product and gives you a nice boost. I will say use 8oz of water for a better taste and stronger punch, as more water seems to water down the effects as well.\n",
      "I use animal stakers and thought I would try this. The taste could have been better. I was not impressed with the boost it gave you. However all it does give is heartburn. So bad tasting, heartburn giving, no pre boost for workout sums it up. \n",
      "I gave this pre workout a try because of the great reviews everyone had given it. I was honestly pretty disappointed by the lack of potency. I wouldn't buy this again. \n",
      "My mom liked it, it would be too small for me.\n",
      "I bought this as a christmas present( over 6 pack and iso) based on youtube reviews. It worked amazingly for the first month or so, and then the inside completely started tearing a part. over all, it was over priced for the poor quality. I'm going to stick with 6 pack or iso for my next purchase. \n",
      "I wanted to love it, but unfortunately it's an overpriced lunch box. Poor quality and value. Wish I would have picked a 6 pack bag. \n",

      "I got this BCAA for my friend who is very picky about flavor, especially when it comes to supplements. The BCAAs I use, she never liked, but she LOVES this one! I tried it and it's really good, a very nice refreshing flavor. I would prefer if there were five or more grams of BCAAs per serving, but at such a good price I really can't complain! Please restock soon, I'll be needing to reorder! :D\n",
      "good taste  \n",
      "I love this stuff! The Strawberry Margarita flavor is one of my favorite flavors, I usually take this post-workouts and the only thing better than the taste to me is the refreshing feeling it gives me.\n",
      "I love this stuff! Taste great and helps me keep going through out my workout. Doesn't make me feel as fatigued as I normally would have.  Have been using this product since May-June of last year and this is the first time I have ever reviewed. I just ordered more as well!  \n",
      "Fantastic product. This was actually my first time including BCAAs into my diet. And I could definitely feel the difference in my work out. Flavor is great not to strong or sweet and easy to drink.\n",
      "I love using BCAA which is why I gave the product a 9/10. The only thing I didn't like was the flavor. The strawberry margarita flavor is a little too sour for my taste. \n",
      "I have tried different brands and so far this one is the best tasting one, no calories and no really after taste. I will keep buying and definitely recommend\n",
      "\n",
      "It tastes like a party in your mouth.  When I run out of it I will buy more.  \n",
      "FitMiss is one of my favorite product lines out there in the fitness industry. The BCAAs taste good and blend very well. They definitely help with muscle recovery and soreness. \n",
      "I absolutely love this product in Strawberry Margarita flavor.  It tastes delicious, without the usual overly sweet taste that many BCAA powders have.  I also have the same energy through my workouts and lessened DOMS from using this. \n",
      "I do like the product , I do feel like most workouts it does what it is suppose to. \n",
      "Tasted fine and mixed well.\n",
      "Just got this product and I absolutely love it!  Doesn't make me feel jittery and I can really feel it working during my workouts.  Will definitely be buying it again.  Just wish it came in a bigger bottle. But overall great product and great taste! \n",
      "LOVE this stuff... definitely helps with my recovery and the taste is delish.  <3\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE this product and Strawberry Margarita taste is sooooooooooo delicious! Seriously guys, the best thing I've ever tried!! Kept me going during my evening workouts after a long day at work. Definitely will be purchasing this again! :) \n",
      "I drank this while working out and the BCAAs gave me energy all the way through. My muscles didn't feel as fatigued as they usually do without this product. And the flavor is pretty good, I thought that maybe Strawberry Margarita would taste a little more fruity, but it still is sweet...definitely not too bitter. Too scared to try the blue raspberry.. I might put a staple in this product for the future, but I still want to test other aminos. \n",
      "I love the BCAAS. The strawberry margarita flavor is DELICIOUS. Will definitely be repurchasing!\n",
      "Absolutely delicious! No aftertastes either.\n",
      "My wife loves the flavor. But after looking at the label and comparing it to my \"regular\" MP BCAAs, realized that the same effects could be had from just using half a serving of the regular BCAAs. Exact same taste as well. Extra points for MP finding a way to use marketing to double the profits on essentially the same product.\n",
      "Love the strawberry margarita! By far, my favorite BCAA flavor I've tried.. \n",
      "This is fab!  The taste is good and it really helps me for pre-workout or during a hard leg day! I highly recommend FitMiss products - all of them I have been ordering have been tasty and delish. \n",
      "i purchased this product based on reviews... and after trying it, i returned it.\n",
      "the sole reason i returned it was due to overall taste.... for me it was MUCH too sweet!  it was like drinking sugar cubes that eventually gave me headaches.\n",
      "I have tried two different types of BCAA drinks I like this one the best it is pretty sweet but I know it works I can feel it this is definitely one thing that I need to have after my workout if you buy it you won't regret it :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly can't say anything bad about this product or I'd be lying to you. \n",
      "I absolutely love it! It tastes exactly like you'd expect it to, I have the Blue Raspberry flavour and am extremely impressed with the taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "I pair this product with the FitMiss Pre-Workout and I go full Beast Mode every time. I've pushed through 60-90 minute workouts without coming out feeling like I was dying or feeling drained and sore. \n",
      "\n",
      "I drink the BCAA's during my workout and I find I don't need to drink it all the time and the 8oz of water mixed with it will last until I'm done my workout, it quenches your thirst and helps you tank through your workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend it girl I know because it works like a charm. \n",
      "I love this product! It is great as a after work out drink. The only thing I wish I could change is how much they send you. I went through my first container so quickly. I feel like I am spending more money for what I am actually getting. \n",
      "This tastes soo good! It's super easy to mix, not clumpy at all. I didn't notice much difference if I took it before workouts, but if I drink it during my workouts, I have so much more energy and stamina. I will definitely be ordering again. :)\n",
      "Almost addictive it is so tasty! Definitely feel I have more stamina when at the gym if I take it 30 mins. prior to going. Feel like since taking this product I feel a difference in the definition of my muscles. Would have gave it a 10/10 except I love it too much that I have never tried any other BCAAs to compare it to. \n",
      "Tastes amazing and it helped my stamina rebuild after working out.\n",
      "I started on this supplement 10 days ago and so far I have already lost almost 4lbs total! After taking for 6 days, I started taking 3 pills at night vs. the recommended 2 pills.  I felt like my body was getting used to the supplement, so I upped the amount I was taking.    I can say this supplement does not give the \"run to the bathroom\" effect (thankfully)... if anything it makes you regular! So far I love the results I am getting! \n",
      "This product definitely does what it claims, its a detox product that i really love and will always keep handy!\n",
      "I love love love this product! Makes me feel so much better and lighter in my midsection! But beware when you got to go you got to go! Lol\n",
      "Purchased for my wife.  She liked the product for the first couple weeks but then seemed to have adjusted and not as effective.\n",
      "Hi I have been on this product for 2 days now and still nothing. Wondering how long you take it before you get results.? I like the convenience of it. I will keep you posted on how it does. \n",
      "This is the first product I've found that works for this purpose...I've tried millions of fiber products and nothing. So glad cleanse is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ive been taking this over a week now and not really noticing any changes to my stomach area.... dont plan to repurchase again.\n",
      "I was hesitant about purchasing this product. First, I am AN EXTREME SKEPTIC! I am skeptical about everything! Second, I am a researcher... I research everything before I buy it just to ensure its not a scam or just to get additional information about the product. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am lucky if I am able to \"go\" twice a week without this product. WITH this product, I can go every single day! Which is awesome... My stomach has shrunk by a few inches just because I am no longer holding that much poo in my intestines. I no longer have that \"bloated\" look to my stomach.. i am very happy =]\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using it for three weeks and it is amazing. After I eat, about 20-30 minutes later I need to go in order to get rid of the old stuff in my system (from last night or whatever) but its not an \"emergency\" kind of go! Its just a typical, I need to go whenever I get a chance kinda go. \n",
      "This product did not work for me. I took two as directed at night with plenty of water throughout the day and it made me feel bloated and awful.\n",
      "I purchased in hopes of cleansing my body. Day one no effects, Day 2 I was running to the bathroom literally. After that, at one point I went 4-5 days without a bm. I don't think it works. Positives, I wasn't bloated after taking. Just not sure if it is worth the $, or if it even works. I am continuing to take the rest of the bottle, so it won't be money completely wasted. \n",
      "This product did nothing for me ! Wont be buying again\n",
      "I always had an \"issue\" having daily bm's but this product absolutely did the trick. Initially, it took about two days to work, but when it started working..it worked.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice product!! Does just what it says, \"Cleanse\"!!! Will def be buying more of this.\n",
      "I definitely noticed a change right away the number on the scale has been going down! Pair this with clean eating and excersise and you will see results. \n",
      "Havent noticed any change\n",
      "I have a really sensitive stomach so I thought this product would go right through me. I read other reviews and people were saying that the first couple of days they had to use the bathroom more then usual. I have been using it for the past 3 days and it has done the complete opposite. I'll continue with the bottle as I don't want to waste it, but will probably not buy again.\n",
      "I have been using this product for 2 months and love the results with whole product line and regular exercise program\n",
      "Awesome I use to consume excessive amounts of Mag and teas and pills and use enemas every day NOTHING has worked like this product would definitely recommend AWESOME so negative side effects all i say is PLEASE DON'T EVER DISCONTINUE and hope they have another coupon code when I'm do for some more \n",
      "I think it's great - reduced my bloating big time with no real side effects after the first couple days. The first couple of days I was headed to the washroom more frequently than I expected but after that things levelled off. I think if you can stick it out for at least a full week you might see this product is really great and worth being part of your stack.\n",
      "It didn't work for me\n",
      "Its helped my digestive tract enormously.  The ingredients especially the papaya and enzymes help me with the bloating and staying regular.  This is a must before bed!!\n",
      "I started taking these 2 weeks ago and have had great results. They have kept me regular and taken the bloat away from my stomach.\n",
      "Ok so i just started taking this product a week ago, and on the 1st night i only took one capsule because i wasn't sure how i was gonna react from it. In the morning i noticed a strong odor coming from my urine but didn't worry me. Night 2 i took 2 pills and the next day i was going #2 a lot more frequently. Night 3 i took 2 more capsules and the next day i was having diarrhea all day and it got worse by the night, so i ended up taking another 2 capsules and from then on i've just been going #2 a lot more. No side effects, just a lot of going to the bathroom. I do think this product is great, really been cleaning out my system,and i see a change in my bloating.. it really helps flatten me out :) totally would recommend it!!\n",
      "This is a great cleanse! Keeps me regular and cleans out the system without the scary affects of a laxative. I take two before bed every night as the directions suggest, and I am very satisfied. Great investment!\n",
      "It says 2 pills before bedtime... I only use one and it's perfect. No cramps and feel so much better. :)\n",
      "This stupid bottle of protein came half full.  I don't know if this was a mistake or a joke, but this is a complete rip-off.  I will never buy this product again and if body building is the one who overlooked this then I won't order from you either....Jennifer Leger\n",
      "I have been buying the Vanilla Chai for YEARS! Its my favorite and I absolutely love it. It is a great flavor and doesnt taste chalky at all. That being said, my most recent order taste different. I am not sure if the recipe changed, or if I got a different flavor in the wrong packaging? I am less thrilled with it this time, which is unfortunate because I purchased 2, 2lb containers at a time.\n",
      "This was the first protein powder I had tried so I didn't have anything to compare it to. I liked the lower calories and I thought it blended well. I just mixed it with cold water, about 20 oz. I would buy it again if it had more protein per serving. \n",
      "I just received this and tired it today.  I got to say I was a little disappointed based on the reviews I was seeing.  I take my protein with ice and water.  The taste left much to be desired as did the grainy texture.  I was pleased with the calorie content at 90 calories it is better than others.  The protein count was slightly lower than I would like as well.  I do not think I will purchase this product again and will just go for a higher calorie and protein count for better taste. \n",
      "Love this protein. I take it every morning for my bfast! Its a quick grab and go meal for me. I love the Vanilla Chai and mix it with ice cubes, almond milk and whatever fruit I have on hand. Tastes great and love that its low in carbs.\n",
      "This is the first protein powder I've ever bought and I love it! Not only is making a shake with it so easy but it also tastes great. I haven't been using it for long therefore haven't seen major results yet but I would definitely still recommend this product. The Vanilla Chai flavor is hard to beat!\n",
      "Absolutely LOVE this protein powder. I have never tasted anything like it. If you like the Vanilla Chai Frappes at McDonalds you will love this. Tastes exactly the same. Mixes really well and keeps you full for  what seems like forever. Love having it for breakfast or after my workouts/ \n",
      "I absolutely love this proteib/ meal replacement. I have never enjoyed drinking a protein shake until I tried fitmiss vanilla chia. I love it and will continue to buy when I need it.\n",
      "Nice product, I like the flavor, fast shipping, I recieved next day. I recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could protein possibly taste better? Jeez! I never get tired of the vanilla chai and I get fun with it and add a little extra spice or matcha powder and ice to enjoy CLEAN chai and green tea frappes in the summer. This protein never upsets my digestion the way others have, even just before a brutal workout. Did I mention that it tastes ridiculously good???\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE the vanilla chai. Chocolate delight isn't bad either. I mix it with unsweetened almond milk in a blender bottle and go. Easy, tastes great, no bad after taste, and price is right.\n",
      "This protein has been a lifesaver so far, with the low calories, great taste, blend-ability, I love it.\n",
      "It has made it easy for me to WANT to have a scoop after a WO and it is so finely milled and smooth that I just throw it in a shaker cup with a bit of water and there are absolutely none of those protein powder bombs we all hate in the mix.  This isn't the highest protein/ lowest carb option out there by any means, but it certainly isn't a bad choice and I'd rather enjoy it than choke it down everyday. The Vanilla Chai is by far the best flavor, but Chocolate Delight and Cookies and Cream are both smooth and creamy and all still really good with plain old water.\n",
      "Highly Recommend.\n",
      "I'm a meathead. I think I have tried almost every protein out there at least once either through this site or at conventions. I love this flavor. It mixes with everything. Strawberries, blue berries, mangos, oatmeal, almond butter. It's even good enough to have by itself. Just add ice & mmm tastes like a snack. I prefer this over Optimum nutrition, Prosups, Animal, Universal, Eps labs, Cellucor, VPX, and so many others. The price isn't bad at all when they have the buy one save 50% off. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. :)\n",
      "I use the Vanilla Chai and I love it!  I use it with Vanilla Almond Milk and ice to thicken it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "This shake taste great and anyone that has tasted mine has thought the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor is disgusting. Ive tasted many protein powders and this is by far the worst. \n",
      "Does not mix well either....very grainy!! \n",
      "I would not recommend at all \n",
      "\n",
      "I love to drink this with 2% milk, hated it with water. Mixes great and the taste is good. Curves my hunger for hours when I use it as my first meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using the Banana Cream Protein for about a month now and love it ! Along with diet and exercise I have lost about 14 pounds. The flavor is so good and it always leaves me feeling so full ! When i'm not at work I like to make it into a protein smoothie ! I use unsweetened coconut almond milk, bananas, strawberries, ice and the protein powder and blend it all together in my Ninja! It is thick and creamy and keeps me full all morning. I can't wait to try the other flavors.\n",
      "The flavors are delicious, especially Cookies N' Cream. I gave this product an 8 because I wish it contained more protein per serving. I find myself using 1.5 scoops, just for the extra bit of protein! Also, this product does not keep me full for a long period of time, as expected. But, overall I love this protein powder, and I will likely buy it again!\n",
      "Love both Chocolate Delight and Cookies and Cream.  I have a strong sweet tooth so both of these keep me on track while helping me get enough protein\n",
      "Usually I try to stay away from anything marketed towards women only because sometimes companies make it a little lighter for females or make it somewhat foo foo. But I read a review on another website discussing multiple brands and benefits and decided to try this. Although it does not have as much protein as I would like, it does have pluses that intrigued me. It has appetite suppressants, it's below 100 calories per serving, and even though I do not like products marketed for women I must admit it does poses certain vitamins that women do need more than men. More plus's, it tastes really good, no chalky/gritty taste, but it does have that normal protein powder after taste. I add this to shakes, yogurt (protein fluff), cookies, and of course it is great by itself with some almond milk. I don't drink it with water (just never have) Those who say they hate it I feel have not tried a wide variety of protein powders to know what that is. Lastly, I find it extremely affordable ESPECIALLY through bodybuilding.com, I find that to be most important to me. I'm ordering banana cream next and eager to try. Hope this helps.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE FitMiss Delight Cookies N' Cream! I have tried various protein powders and this is by far the best. I typically mix it with almond milk and use it as a meal replacement. It keeps me full for hours, mixes very well and has great taste! Highly recommended!\n",
      "I was sooo excited when reading the reviews for this protein brand that I decided to give it a try and ordered the Cookies N' Cream flavor...Oh boy am I disappointed...Waoooo this is extremely sweet I felted like I was drinking pure sugar, and the quality of the protein it's not that good. I had purchased cookies N' cream before but from another brand, but wanted to keep searching for other ones and decided for fitmiss. Maybe I'll give Vanilla a try but not sure yet. I'm tired of searching for the best powder protein and wasting my money here and there...but I guess I have to just keep searching in the meantime...\n",
      "Flavor is pretty important to me because it it tastes bad I'm not going to drink it. Well I kept looking for good protein powders with great flavors and found this one. And because Cookies N' Cream had the best reviews I decided on it. IT'S SO GOOD! I'm really pick when it comes to a good tasting powder but this is delicious. Although it doesn't really taste like cookies and cream to me. It tastes more like butter pecan ice cream so it feels like every time I drinking I'm eating ice cream. It's really good! Definitely helps with the cravings, I love it.\n",
      "Horrible taste! I couldn't camouflage the taste with anything. Had to give it away at the gym I worked at. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While I haven't tried many protein powders I enjoy this one, I prefer to mix it with a handful of frozen berries and milk/water. Only negative is that it can tend to clump up creating little powder bombs that aren't the tastiest when you get to them. So use a blender. Overall though I'd buy it again!\n",
      "For one of my first protein shakes, it really isn't bad. The taste is kind of artificial but I know not to except too much from a protein/supplement shake. I give it a low score because it really doesn't fill me up, like at all. It says it is okay to replace snacks or full meals but it really just feels like I'm drinking really healthy chocolate milk and I'm hungry right after. I try not to eat because I know it's supposed to fill me up. It does make me recover faster from my workouts so that's fine, but as a meal replacer I would look elsewhere.\n",
      "I love this product, so far! I've been using it for ten days and have lost 5.4 pounds. I've been doing 2-3 protein shakes a day, drinking lots of water, staying under 1200 calories, and eating really lean foods. I am 5'4, and started off at 155 pounds. Today I'm at 149.6 and feeling great. Cant wait to see what happens when i start hitting the gym hard again, and using this product. \n",
      "\n",
      "The vanilla chai is probably my favorite. Tastes like something that came from Starbucks. I usually do one in the morning with just one scoop, a cup of unsweetened almond milk and the rest is water. Fills me up for a few hours and tastes yummy. \n",
      "If I want to treat myself or its more for lunch/dinner, I blend one scoop of vanilla chai, with a cup of strawberries & bananas, and a cup of unsweetened almond milk. I absolutely love it, and feels like i am  cheating on my diet. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also bought the cookies and cream as well. i really like it because it tastes like dessert to me. It gets me my chocolate fix.My boyfriend tried it and said its tastes like chalk but hes obsessed with the vanilla chai one. Different strokes for different folks, but i love this brand. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, this is the best tasting protein powder I've ever had. It keeps me full for a long time (but I blend it with almond milk, 2 small bananas and 2 tbsp of peanut butter, for me it's a lunch meal replacement). You cannot go wrong with Fitmiss Delight in Banana creme!!!!!\n",
      "FitMiss cookies and cream flavor is very sweet, but very good.  I like to drink it while I'm working out.  I think it's a nice filler between meals and would very much recommend it to other women for weightlifting.  \n",
      "The chocolate flavor wasn't that great, it was okay and not bad. I guess I was just hoping for a more chocolatey milkshake flavor. \n",
      "This protein taste really good and keeps me full great as snack or meal\n",
      " tastes kinda gross, but its a thick protein. Keeps me full, and does what protein should.\n",
      "I'm not very experienced in the protein shake world, but I needed something. I'm currently on a weight loss journey. Trying to lose 45 pounds total and have lost 17/18 pounds so far. When I began weight training, my muscles took far too long to recover and I did some research on what protein powder I should get. I blend this powder with a cup of almond milk and a cup of ice per scoop (only 150 calories and 17g of protein!). Makes a hearty amount and I think it's delicious! My recovery time was shortened by several days! I think this protein is PERFECT for those who are trying to lose weight, need protein but want to keep calories low. With 16g of protein for only 90cal per scoop, it's definitely a great deal! \n",
      "I tried this in the banana flavor and loved it. I could put it in pancakes or drink it with juice and it all tasted pretty decent and worked well. I was happy with the product, so I bought cookies and cream as well. I wish I could return the cookies and cream flavor. It tastes terrible! \n",
      "I've been using Fitmiss for about 3 months.  It really helps with recovery and hunger.  \n",
      "Flavor taste like Protein shake/ chocolate milk. If you like chocolate milk this is the choice. Actually more like if you ever had a chocolate carnation shake, wanted to try Banana Creme but it was out of stock. \n",
      "This has to be one of my favorite protein powders. It mixes well, tastes great, and cooks extremely well. I love how it has some greens in it as well. This is such a great all around protein powder. I am extremely impressed with it. \n",
      "FitMiss Delight is a very good protein powder for women. For the most part, the ingredients are desirable although the vegetables included are not significant enough to make much of a difference. I have tried several protein powders before concluding that this was the product for me. This is my first time writing a review for any product purchased on BodyBuilding.com but I thought this product was worthy of a positive review. You can get it for a good price. Walgreen's even sells the 1lb size for $19.99. Chocolate of course is the best of the two flavors I've tried. I didn't love Oreo Cookies and Cream so I used it in my green smoothies and was able to finish the 2lbs that I had in stock. \n",
      "I have the Vanilla Chai, I think it tastes good but it only keeps me full for about an hour or so and I am not quiet sure it has helped me to lose any weight. \n",
      "I've tried various \"reputable\" health and wellness lines and their protein shakes and this has the best taste and texture! It also can be a good \"Meal on-the-go\" or a snack. Enjoy! \n",
      "\n",
      "The best tasting protein powder out there - by far!! The cookies n cream is the best, followed by strawberry & vanilla chai - I have not tasted the others.  \n",
      "I have followed their diet and used all the supplements (except for BCAA AND slim) I dropped a pant size in a week & still shrinking. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before deciding on this line of supplements & and I am not in the least disappointed.\n",
      "The only painful thing is the Fitmiss website - you are supposed to be able to log on for the full diet and exercise program - recipes etc, but the site is down. I managed to get a copy of the eating plan by emailing them, it's a nicely laid out program, highly recommend it.\n",
      "I'll let you know where I get to by the end of August :-)\n",
      "I love this protein. It's really low calorie and tastes great! I would like it to have more protein, but 16g for 90 calories is more than enough. If I want to get more protein and use it as a meal replacement I can always use two scoops, but one scoop has been more than enough to keep me full for hours. I use cashew or almond milk with it and love the taste and consistency. I highly recommend! \n",
      "Wife loves the low calories in this protein\n",
      "Tastes amazing seriously with water or almond milk so good I had a different more expensive brand before and switched to this brand this brand tastes so much better love it but it won't regret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outstanding protein product.  I mix the Cookies and Cream with both vanilla or chocolate soy milk for breakfast.  Tastes delicious and doesn't have a whole lot of calories.  Definitely keeps me full and satisfied until lunch.  Great for an in between meal or snack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will definitely be buying again.\n",
      "This is a very light and delish protein powder that does not have an after taste and mixes very well in the shaker.  It is fab for pre workout or post // and if you are in a rush and need a quick breakfast shake...very filling too.  Love the banana cream flavor and can highly recommend it.\n",
      "Love the banana cream flavor! Taste just like pudding. Not super filling but not bad either.\n",
      "Excellent taste, a good amount of protein, and filling.\n",
      "I love, love, love this protein powder! I was a little iffy about it when I opened the container to see that the powder wasn't soft and fluffy like the Combat protein powder I had just finished but any and all doubt went away when I threw it in with my morning smoothie. It has a perfect banana flavour and it's low in calories. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's great with nut milk or in a smoothie, I haven't tried it with water yet but I have no doubt that it will taste just as great as it does with anything else I mix it with. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm looking forward to trying the other flavours. \n",
      "Today was my first day having this, and trying any protein drink. I love it! \n",
      "I love Fitmiss Delight! I use the chocolate, it has helped me lose 15 lbs to date and will continue to use it. BUT you need to up your stock., you are always out of stock.  I need to order right now and I can't because you are out, this does not make me happy \n",
      "My morning shake has never been so delicious and satisfying.  1 scoop of the Banana Cream powder, 8 oz unsweetened vanilla almond milk, 1 package plain instant oatmeal, 1 tbs peanut butter, and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon.... splash with some water and add a few pieces of ice and you've got the perfect morning drink that will keep you full for at least 3-4 hours.\n",
      "This powder is helping me hit my macros on a low-carb & low cal diet.  My only compliant is that it's very thin... I do wish it would thicken up to more of a \"milkshake\" consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoy this powder. The taste is great and the texture is wonderful. It's not gritty or heavy. It is a very thin shake though so if your planning on using this as a meal replacement I would add a few thickening ingredients to it. I love it for right after a work out. It quenches my thirst and helps with my recovery.\n",
      "Best tasting protein out there!  Mixes great and tastes even better. Highly recommend.\n",
      "I purchased this with high expectations because I love mp products. I had never tried any kind of banana cream protein, and the vanilla chia seemed different then the usual ON vanilla milkshake flavor i usually take, so i decided to give them a try. The banana cream was HORRIBLE. It had such an artificial taste that i gagged trying to get it down. I tried mixing it in with my oatmeal and ended up having to throw the whole bowl away. The vanilla chai wasn't horrible and was one of the better tasting flavors I have tried but I am going to stay away from the fit miss line from now on. \n",
      "I love this! It keeps me fuller longer and has a great taste. Its great for before the gym, and has helped me lose fat and gain muscle. I absolutely love the FitMiss products. \n",
      "this was absolutely amazing, i got it for my gf just to try it out and she loved it. very easily mixed with the shaker and the taste was delicious she told me. not to mention very little calories so she felt full without eating a crazy amount of calories\n",
      "I've used this product for the last three days and it has been amazing at curbing my appetite, making me fill full, and I seem to have more energy already compared to the two previous products that I've tried form other health food stores! I am already convinced and hook on the flavor (banana cream) and product! \n",
      "This is not Delightful at all.  It's Vanilla something, but not Vanilla Chai.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please excuse the poor rating, it was just that this is the first time I've tried this product and I kept having a bad reaction whenever I take it.  It's like a nervous reaction, so I'm guessing it might be a reaction to the B12.\n",
      "\n",
      "With my bad reaction to it, the odd taste, and only 16g of protein per scoop, you can see why I won't be buying this in the future.\n",
      "This is the first time that i buy the Fitmiss brand, I dont have a big experience in protein powders, only tasted before Designer Whey and Optimum Nutrition. Im in a weight loss journey and so far Delight is the best tasting protein powder that ive had, as well i just love the macros on this one and really keeps you full for a long time. The only reason that i dont rate it as a 10 is because of the artificial flavoring. I use this everyday with 1 cup of almond milk, 1 tbs almond butter, 1 scoop delight and either 1/4 cup of ice or 1/2 cup of water, since it is very sweet. also great for cooking. \n",
      "Ran out of my old stuff & decided to give this a try. Lower protein than the old one but LOVE it & contains a lot of other great stuff. Tastes amazing even with water and great in-between meals to keep me going.\n",
      "I love this Protein!I had purchase it before but the smaller to give it a try and its honestly really delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought FitMiss DeLight Vanilla Chai on the recommendation of a friend and was completely underwhelmed by it. There is a significant chemical aftertaste to this protein, making it unpalatable without the addition of other ingredients. I also don't understand the reasoning behind calling the flavor vanilla chai, as there is absolutely no chai flavor to this protein. \n",
      "For those that can tolerate the taste, the nutrition profile is fine. I will not be recommending or repurchasing FitMiss DeLight. I'll also think twice before taking any more of that friend's recommendations again. Lol!\n",
      "I love this product. It tastes delicious, and it is very filling. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein is really good and the banana cream is tasty! If u buy a shaker it blends really good! I haven't tried it with water but is awesome with fat free milk! I drink one after my workout in the mornings and it really keeps you full!\n",
      "Best protein I have used! I was looking for something to use as a snack and post workout that was lower in calories, so I tried this. It is fantastic!!! I have recommended it to everyone at my box! Great in fruit smoothies or for cooking. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered Vanilla Chai. I love it. It tastes great, and fills me up. When I use it as a meal replacement i use skim milk, if i need a snack or post workout i use water! \n",
      "\n",
      "Either way I am highly pleased with this product! \n",
      "Love the flavour! Does a great job and it also mixes well. \n",
      "Mixed great and vanilla tasted great even in just water.  Only drawback is this brand is so much more expensive than the other protein powders available.  \n",
      "The flavor is very good but the protein powder itself doesn't really fit my goals. I don't eat meat (only seafood) so protein powders need to have a higher amount of protein to meet my goals. Overall, I really liked this powder thought. it mixes very well and tastes great. \n",
      "It's excellent, tastes exactly what a yummy vanilla chai should taste like but with out all the bad stuff. I highly recommend it. \n",
      "I bought this because of all of the nutrients and use it as a meal replacement, usually in the morning alone or mixed as a smoothie with banana.  It is very filling and does its job well but the taste is horrible.  It has a very funky after taste.  I tried to use it up mixing it into cookie dough or brownies but the taste is so strong.  The banana/peanut butter smoothie makes it tolerable but usually still makes me gag, lol.   Sorry to give such a bad review to an otherwise good product.  I'm too turned off by the chocolate to even take a chance on the vanilla chai.  Too bad..I really like the idea of the product.\n",
      "Love the taste of it! Even better if you mix in some fat free yogurt and soy or skim milk! \n",
      "Absolutely delicious and worked like a charm!\n",
      "Flavor is okay. Not the best taste, but I love that the calories are low, because as a female, we do not need a load of calories in a protein drink. Tastes great when blended with a frozen banana and some cinnamon and a Tbsp. of natural PB! Loaded with good for you ingredients, but does contain sugar. \n",
      "I have been a big fan of Shakeology but couldn't afford the cost, so I went out to look for another shake.  I was truly surprised at the overall nutrients of this shake and the cost was something to really smile at.  The taste is not to sweet and it doesn't have an after taste like some others I have tried.  The calories were lower then what I was used to, so I was worried that I would feel hungry within a few hours but surprisingly I was not.  I am very satisfied with this product, so much that I ordered another flavor (strawberry). \n",
      "I love love love this product. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a meal replacement, it worked great!  I use 8oz of water to mix, no ice, and 1 scoop and it kept me feeling satisfied (not full) throughout my work day.    I will update/re-review after I have used for 30 days (only used for 1 week so far). \n",
      "\n",
      "As for flavor, I feel like it could use more of it.  The vanilla chai isn't bad, but it's not great either.   If you have ever had a Slim Fast shake, it's like that, but a bit milder on the flavor.  If mixed with milk it would probably be awesome, but I haven't tried that yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "YUM! This protein powder is delicious! Mixed it with almond milk, 1/2 banana, and ice cubes.....so good! I also baked with it from some of the FitMiss recipes located on their website.....the Peanut Butter Squares are amazing! Definitely worth trying! Looking forward to trying the other flavors too! :)\n",
      "This is an awesome protien, very neat to include all the fruits in it, an interesting concept. I bought it for my wife and she loved it so I tried it. Very smooth nice strawberry flavor. Only thing is its fairly expensive\n",
      "Wife uses and loves it\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a very good protein shake. It mixed easily. I had the vanilla chai with water and it was good. Haven't tried it with milk but I'm thinking it will be too creamy for me. Overall great product\n",
      "I have been using this product for 2 months and love the results with whole product line and regular exercise program\n",
      "It is the worst tasting protein I have had. I will never ever buy this again it was expensive but usually that means it's good not the case at all. I do love body building web site.it did fill me up\n",
      "Now I've read mixed reviews about this product so I said to my self why not?  Well the status right now is that I can't wait to finish this. It did a good job even lost 3 pounds within the first week of proper use and exercise. The flavor was good at first especially with fat free lactose milk sooo good! But when it comes to using water its just not the same. I have to ice it to the max in order to enjoy it. Other then that I probably won't use it again due to the price. But it does the job of curving your hunger and having good flavor.\n",
      "This product is very good. This was my first time using protein and i was unsure of the taste at first but then i mixed it with chocolate soy milk and that made it taste so much better! Overall good product!\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "Finally found a supplement that I can drink and not make face of digust,really happy that its low calorie and has 16 g of protein in a serving!\n",
      "I love this stuff! The Vanilla Chai tastes soo good! Not to mention it mixes really good! I didn't have any lumps in my drink and it tastes good with water or anything you mix it with! Definitely ordering this again and trying the other flavors!\n",
      "I love this stuff! So delicious and I definitely want to make it a staple in my pantry. Already finished the one I had and cannot wait to finish my other protein powders to get back on this one.\n",
      "Product had a slight after taste but really isn't bad. I mix mine with water and I am totally amazed that I am not hungry for hours! This is a GREAT weightloss product!! \n",
      "Let me say  that I have tried Isogenix, 310 shakes, and many other protein shakes before I stumbled upon this taste of heaven. FitMiss Delight Vanilla Chai is by far the best tasting protein shake I have had! The Vanilla Chai tastes like cake batter! It tastes great with just water or almond milk. I also like to add plain greek yogurt, frozen fruit, and cayenne for an added boost.  It also keeps me feeling full for 3 to 4 hours! I just ordered the strawberries n cream and I can't wait to try it!. Love this shake!\n",
      "I have been using this for around a week now, and this helps me not feel the urge to snack and fill full..\n",
      "But i will have to wait for a bit longer to see if the toning and reduce body fat side works\n",
      "I had no side effects whatsoever, great product definitely noticed results \n",
      "Tone worked very well with Burn, but you have an enormous migraine all day long. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have only been taking these for about a month now and I haven't seen much of a difference. I mainly gave this product a 6 in rating because I found CLA's for MUCH cheaper. I don't know what I was thinking when I paid $19 for 60 capsules of 1000 mgs when I can get 540 capsules of 800 mgs for $40... I should have done my research!\n",
      "So far this product is great. I have a totally different type of energy. Its steady does not make you shake or have the jitters. I feel full without feeling bloated. Took it this morning with breakfast 7am. Its almost dinner time (4pm) and Im not super hungry.  Lower rating because it hasnt been that long since I started. I will update my review as I get farther along in my program. \n",
      "I absolutely love this product. The definition that it has helped me to achieve in not only my legs, triceps, and biceps, but also in my traps- is mind blowing!! Definitely sticking with this product!\n",
      "This product did absolutely nothing. I changed nothing in my diet so that I could attribute any weight loss only to this product. I had no change whatsoever in my weight. 8.9/10 overall rating for this product is a joke. If you look closely, almost all high ratings are from suspiciously empty, fake-looking accounts. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Sadly, too late for me. \n",
      "I noticed absolutely nothing when I took this product. Very disappointed.\n",
      "I used this with Burn. I am almost through the first bottle and have had a noticeable difference in body fat, especially in my mid-section. I Love this product and definitely recommend it!!\n",
      "I too it just like it says and workout 4 days a week and walked out days at park ... And  I never lost a single pounds . I wish I had never order this stuff I even took it with the cleanse and it still don't help me . BIG WASTE Of MY MOMEY\n",
      "Product did the exact opposite. It only curbed my cravings for a portion of the day to where I was hungry later in the day and I ended up gaining a few lbs. It did nothing for energy levels or workouts. Why bother taking anything at all?\n",
      "I was shocked to see how much I had overpaid for CLA. I purchased this in a package and was not impressed. I will not purchase again due to price but it compared to any other CLA on the shelf\n",
      "\n",
      "I have almost completed one bottle of this, and have actually gained weight! I work out 4-5 days a week and eat well! I feel super bloated and heavier. No, I would not recommend this product!!!\n",
      "Loved FitMiss Tone! I gave it an 8 because it is a high maintenance product. It has to be taken 3 times daily and I usually only end up remembering to take it twice. Also, considering the only ingredient is CLA it's quite expensive. I can buy the Muscle Pharm CLA Core for $21.99 with 90 servings (which I did purchase and will be trying soon) versus Tone for $34.99 with only 60 servings. It's the exact same product, you're just paying more for FitMiss. Overall, I did see results, but I will probably not be purchasing this product again just because I have found the same product cheaper. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using his product for a couple of weeks and  I can definitely see a big difference, it also helps to curb any afternoon cravings.\n",
      "Will totally recommend this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "This product does not \"Tone\" by any means. It made me gain weight because of the gelatin ingredient that it has in it. I have tried the \"Cleanse\" and it does work & clean your body of toxins, so two thumbs up for that. But the \"Tone\" is a BIG NO GO for me. \n",
      "Another favorite of mine and a must have! Love that it has CLA in it.\n",
      "Love the whole Fit Miss line...I like that you can take it with meals...not a half hr before (cuz i would never remember to take it). Great product with great results!\n",
      "This product is CLA in a smaller bottle at a higher cost.\n",
      "Regardless the product works great and you see good results.\n",
      "This product works great!!!!! The products took under 24hrs to start working. The is one safety precaution.... MAKE SURE YOU ARE ALWAYS NEAR A RESTROOM. \n",
      "I've been using TONE, BURN, BALANCE & CLEANSE together and have seen results and feel great! I'm going to try the shake next ... Can't wait to get it! This product (Tone) doesn't leave you jittery at all... I just take one capsule with each meal. \n",
      "I have been using this product for 2 months and love the results with whole product line and regular exercise program \n",
      "I have only taken this product once, (completed whole bottle). I have used both BURN and TONE and prefer burn. I saw more results. Tone is a high maintenance tablet that needs to be taken 3 times a day! If you want to see results try BURN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did not see a difference after 1 month.\n",
      "Helped me sleep better, but made my muscles feel twitchy. Only used it twice. \n",
      "I give this product a 5/10 because I didn't see a difference in my sleep or feel that I woke up more \"refreshed\". But, I did get a little extra zinc, magnesium, copper, and chromium in my daily intake...I'll just stick with my nightly routine of drinking chamomile lavender tea! Every \"body\" is different! ;)  \n",
      "I am absolutely in love with the this product. I get a great nights sleep and then I wake up ready for my morning work out, which is great since I start at 4am. I need that extra push . I will be sticking with this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried every sleep aid known to man. This helps me stay asleep and I wake up refreshed and ready to start my day. I'm looking forward to trying other products in this line. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted this product to work for but it does not. It does give a slightly relaxed feeling but it does not put me in a deep good sleep. I actually become very restless in the middle of the night. I won't purchase it again.\n",
      "Love this product! Helps me sleep without my mind racing at night. I feel refreshed in the am. I highly recommend this!!\n",
      "I have been using this product for about two weeks now and it has been amazing. Each morning I feel fully rested and energized for the day. I start to feel the supplements 40-60 minutes after taking them and the affects are very strong. The only warning I would give is make sure you are ready to go to bed after you take them because your body will \"crash\". The bottle recommends that you take them on an empty stomach but occasionally I will indulge in a snack or two after taking them. Also, make sure that if you do take the supplements, give yourself at least 6 hours minimum of sleep or else you will not feel rested at all. I normally go to bed around 10 pm and wake up around 7 or 8 am. Overall, this is a great product that has helped get rid of the excess water weight and bloating I normally had in the morning. \n",
      "Love this product! Helps me fall asleep which is usually hard for me to so when I'm trying to lose weight. However I've noticed I am sweating more at night since being on this product however it does not make you groggy. Actually makes you wake up refreshed and ready to start your day with a workout\n",
      "I was skeptical of this until I read all of the ingredients. There is the 5-HTP that is recommended for deeper better sleep and then there are the other standard vitamins that help when you are training/on a cut : Chromium Picolinate, Zinc, Magnesium. Then there is some B6.  So basically it is multople supplements (that I would normally take) all in one. \n",
      "\n",
      "After taking this for a couple weeks I can say that it definitely helps me sleep deeper which makes me feel better when I am recovering from a heavy workout. \n",
      "First I tasted it plain--it was terrible!  Then I added some Nuts n More PB spread--still terrible!  Then I even added syrup and it was just moderately terrible.  Hands down the worst thing I've purchased on BB.com.  I won't up just throwing most of the 2 bags I got away.  I'm not sure why I even made myself try the 2nd flavor....just shear tight wade ness because I paid for it already I suppose :)  STAY AWAY!!  \n",
      "\n",
      "I often add cellucor cinnamon swirl protein to a standard pancake or baking mix to amp the protein along with some egg whites.  Much better and cheaper!\n",
      "It was good, tasted as good as most regular pancake mixes.  I added fresh blueberries and used very little REAL maple syrup.  I will buy it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is very good when it is topped with sliced frozen fruit and Greek yogurt rather than syrup. One should be careful to choose a Greek yogurt that is made by a legitimate company, stay away from shady corporations like Yoplat (made by Pepsi-Cols), Dannon, Activa, anything advertised on television because these brands have added sugar and other things that might not be listed in the ingredients. Look up the brand you are considering and check that it is by a family- owned company and that they use milk from cows not treated with hormones.  \n",
      "It is a little tricky to get it cooked just right; it is difficult to get the middle cooked so that it is not wet, but this does not harm the flavor. \n",
      "All flavors are very good when prepared this way. \n",
      "It also provides a good macro-nutrient profile and the added whey is not harmed by the cooking, but I still take cold-processed whey right after working out. \n",
      "It tastes awfully! Nothing like a pancake, no banana or hazelnut flavor, carrot spice isn't better. Will not reorder. \n",
      "Delicious. Helps me hit my macros. Taste good. What more could a girl ask for. \n",
      "Don't lick the batter because you will wrongly prejudge your pancake. If you like carrot cake, then you will enjoy this. But it must have cream cheese icing. You can combine 1 TBSP of lite cream cheese with 1-2 TBSP Walden Farms Pancake Syrup. I added extra nutmeg and cinnamon to make it more exciting. I like that it's really easy to prepare (just add water). The only hard part of this recipe is flipping the pancake. Would I buy it again? Yes. \n",
      "Love Theese pancakes!!! Easy to make, delicious and protein packed. Also had the Apple cinnamon and banana hazelnut, All yummy!\n",
      "Excellent product!!  Very tasty!\n",
      "My kids even loved it!\n",
      "Decided to try this product a few months ago via local natural foods store. It tastes absolutely delicious. It mixes incredibly easy per directions, doesn't clump, and cooks perfectly. I've only tried the cinnamon apple flavor; try some apple jam on it to really get the full taste. I recently ordered some via BBDC once I realized they had this, and I will definitely be ordering more in the future.\n",
      "They're just amazing. They are so easy to make and taste is good! I might also add a scoop of flavored protein powder to add more protein per serving but these are overall awesome!\n",
      "This was great and tasted amazing.\n",

      "DIdn't see much at all. Plus i would stay away from this company they list \"flour\" as an ingredient in all of their products. I would be very cautious with that with all the tampering going on in the supplement company these days. Why would flour be a necessary ingredient? an unhealthy one too\n",

      "Does what its supposed to! Took it 20 minutes before my workout, and started feeling the sweats come in, and had red ears haha. As I've used this I've dropped 7lbs with proper diet and training while maintaing and gaining more strenght as well. Great product.\n",
      "I really liked this thermo! It is a great way to get your day going. There is only one downfall that i did notice, as well as my friend taking it as well. When you first take it you really feel super hot and then get very red. But after awhile that effect starts to dwindle. So overall I think it is a great product besides looking like Rudolph the red nose reindeer.   \n",
      "This stuff is amazing to have. After mixing and drinking it I feel very energized and focused. Probably the biggest thing about it that works for me if how it suppressed my appetite. I am a 230lb big eater and this stuff made me not even feel that hungry. I recommend this to anyone who needs to lose fat. \n",
      "REAL REVIEW:\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I bought this supplement awhile back and I paired it with Shred JYM. The reason being was that the veggie capsules contained no caffeine while JYM did, so I didn't want an overload on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the product, I have not lost any great deal of weight nor do I feel as if it affected me in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could take this product 30-45 mins before a meal and feel fine which was nice compared to some supplements. I didn't have a feel of extra energy or a boost of anything. While the product wasn't bad, I can not say if it was good either as my personal experience shows no results, negative or positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not recommend this product solely on the fact that I had no reaction to the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this knowing full well that it's thermogenic properties were not going to be strong. I really bought it for the concentrated Hoodia Godonii. It's a great appetite suppressant and is working exactly as expected. I had to double the dose. Two capsules was just too subtle for me, but that is pretty typical with me and supps.\n",
      "Highly recommend it. Start with two capsules, if you don't feel anything after a couple of days, ramp up to four first thing in the morning and it should keep you satiated until lunch. Sip on some protein and have a salad with four more of these and it'll freak you out how quickly you get full and no longer need to eat. Great if you're cutting. Terrible if you're bulking, kills your desire to eat.\n",
      "I've been taking this product for over a month. I haven't seen a drop in weight but I have noticed a significant reduction in inches around my stomach and the ability to keep reducing at a slow rate and maintain. the non thermal is wonderful to not have to worry about sweating throughout the day or heavier during workouts. I recommend this product for those looking to shed a few. \n",
      "This doesn't work for ****.   It's a full on placebo, I didn't even lose 1oz and increased my cardio and lifting regimen.   There's no quick pill or substitute that will make you lose weight.  It's 100% diet and exercise.  \n",
      "Flavor is great.  I mix with my ump (Beverly international) protein.  \n",
      "I THINK THIS IS AN ALRIGHT PRODUCT BUT WAS A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED TO OPEN THE CANISTER AND FOUND IT COMPLETELYSOLID. THERE WAS NO PACKET IN IT TO KEEP THE MOISTURE AWAY. I DID GET IT ALL BROCKEN UP. IT HAS A GOOD FLAVOR, GIVES PRETTY GOOD ENERGY. NOT THE BEST NOT THE WORST. TO ME IT JUST IS A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD PWO.\n",
      "took this on light stomach went to gym half hour later did workout was nearly finished felt little pump and little more energy next day took 2 scoops got noting out of it.next day took 1 scoop noting again.today i got up took it first thing as i would be on empty stomach and noting.took 2 scoops on empty noting waste of money.\n",
      "Gave this a 2nd try, while it gave me great energy and good pumps, it still produced gas. Can't stand that. Also, the taste is still not good. If it weren't for the gassy effect, I'd tolerate the taste and keep using it.\n",
      "Great pwo, good sustained energy throughout the entire workout. No coach and very good pump. 2 scoops is good for intense workouts but the only downfall is the higher than average prices for only a possible 15 servings. If this was cheaper it would definitely be my go to pwo. Taste 9/10 and very easy to drink and best taste I have had in a pwo. Mixed easily as we'll.\n",
      "Taste good however i felt absolutely nothing, no energy, no pump... this product is over rated, i will never purchase it again\n",
      "This is by far the best pre-workout I have tried so far. I am a fire fighter in the Air force and I needed something that gives me the extra energy and an awesome pump during my workouts. Since all we do is mainly work out when where not putting out fires or sitting around waiting for something interesting to happen. I would definitely recommend Volatile to anyone who is looking to step it from a pre-workout that is not working for them and who wants to feel and see the results from the very first exercise you do when you hit the gym.    \n",
      "Great focus and energy. has not made me jittery like some other products. Not the best tasting and doesn't mix as well as others but gets the job done! I switch between this and c4 at the moment and they are very similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tops pretty much everything ive ever been on. (1MR original, C4, jack3d and micro, MP assult) Focus is unbelievable. Taste very sweet and easy to drink. no weird after taste. Pump is intense. no problems lifting heavy, great power until i hit my last rep, then its like hitting a wall. Muscles much more sore than they have been in the past. I HIGHLY recommend this to ANYONE. Glad i took the chance and ordered something ive never heard of haha well worth it\n",
      "I am in my 40's, and when I have issues sleeping this really helps, and it is a deep sleep! I do not mind the taste, but does clump a little. \n",
      "Have used this for years and it helps me sleep and I always feel stronger in the morning\n",
      "Cycled hgh with a testosterone booster over a 1 month time frame, put on about 10-15lbs of muscle, i look more toned, recovered time reduced by almost a full day and my muscles feel more solid than before. Awesome product \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm taking this product because I have FIBROMYALGIA and want to boost my HGH levels naturally. I've only been on it for a week, but what I've noticed so far is that it really helps with my sleep. The directions say to take 30 minutes before bedtime on an empty stomach. I follow the directions and it does really make me extremely tired. Also, my skin seems to be softer and more elastic. I have also noticed what seems to be faster healing of cuts and sores. I am also experiencing improvement with my memory of details and a lifting of the 'fibro fog' that plagues us fibro victims. I'm hoping all these things will get even better. I will leave another review after another week or so of using this product. No bad side effects so far. - So far I'm pleasantly surprised by this product!\n",
      "Taste of this product is average to good.  But mixability is poor at best.  Even with excess liquid the product separates and clumps in a blender bottle with blender ball I wouldn't even attempt mixing with a spoon.  I would rate it an 7 but since I have to chew it it gets a 4.  I would not purchase again.\n",
      "I have tried so many brands. This is by far , the most powerful, pre- workout supp, of them all. I will be using this as my choice of pre- workout from now on. It's Awesome! \n",
      "Never taken a supplement like this before and I do enjoy it helps to push longer and run for longer amounts of time. \n",
      "It definitely puts me to sleep, but when I wake up I am groggy for the rest of the day.  I have tried 1, 2, 3 and 4 pill dosages.  I am pretty disappointed, I had high hopes.  Would not buy again.  \n",
      "I've had trouble going to sleep for a while now, where'd i'd just lie awake in bed, wanting to sleep, but I can't. After seeing all the reviews for this product, I enthusiastically placed and order, and couldn't wait to try it out. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the first night, I took it as instructed, 4 pills with no calcium an hour before I wanted to sleep. Felt absolutely NOTHING. Sleep felt no different than ever before. Thought to myself, hey maybe my body needs to get used to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the second night, I took it 90 minutes before I wanted to sleep. Still felt ABSOLUTELY nothing. Didn't make me drowsy, didn't make my sleep better, didn't do ANYTHING.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third night, same thing. I'm not consuming calcium, i'm not consuming caffeine, or anything. \n",
      "Very effective second sleep aide to bullet proof.\n",
      "Very good product!\n",
      "I tried Shut-eye since I did not wanna start taking sleeping pills since at 1 time I was dependent on them :(. The first night I took Shut-Eye, I was out like a lamp and woke up feeling refreshed and didn't feel the usual morning grog I do. A personal effect that it had on me was that usually when I wake up, my mid and lower back are usually achey and sore, but waking up after taking Shut-Eye, I had no aches or soreness :). I use it mainly during the week days cycling on and off since I need the most rest during the week. I havent stopped taking Shut-Eye since my first bottle and thats been over a year ago!!\n",
      "Shuteye does what the name of the product says it does. Man, I take this and 30-45 minutes later I’m out. It works better for me on an empty stomach so if you drink casein protein before bed you may want to take about 1 &frac12; to 2 hours before taking this or immediately before you hit the pillow 30 minutes after taking this stuff. I thought Animal PM was good, but this blows that s*** out the water son. I’m a guy that usually wakes up at least once to use the bathroom during the night. Not with this product. Sleep plays an important role in strength gains and since I’ve been sleeping better, I’m stronger than ever. I’m a fan.\n",
      " After taking only one pill, I cannot remain awake. I'm out for the night and wakeup considerably refreshed. Though I'm only taking a partial dosage, I have seen an uptick in strength and endurance during morning workouts. It's been a good product for me and I'll buy it again and recommend it.\n",
      "Nothing negative to say except a little pricy. Does exactly what the label says. I would recommend this to anyone. Especially if you can't peel yourself out of bed early to workout and workout later in the day/evening with PWO's that are loaded with caffeine and other stims and need something safe to help you sleep this is your stuff right here. I use to wake up alot in the middle of the night especially with PTSD nightmares and this even helps with that. Nightmares turned into some funny *** dreams and I only wake up one or two times a night now. Two thumbs up!\n",
      "Took this with erase pro and saw MAJOR results. You pay for what you get and if you want the real deal this is it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I been using this product  for two weeks and I seen result within the first week the result were amazing both in the gym and bedroom. Would give this a 10 but the only down fall is I think there should be a bigger serving size or more capsules \n",
      "Does nothing! A total waste of money\n",
      "this product realy help me maintaining my stamina during my endurance workouts....\n",
      "Great Product\n",
      "Been using GFuel for about a week or two now and I'm really enjoying what I'm using it for. I work a 9-5 job and do my workouts after work. I mix some up right before I get in the car and drink it on my way to work. Keeps me going through lunch then around 2 I will mix up another serving and drink it to keep me going through 5 and the drive home. There isn't much caffeine in it so it's really perfect for my use. If you already consume high amounts of caffeine you probably won't feel much energy from the product but if you are like me and aren't a caffeine addict it's the perfect amount to give a little boost. I alternate between lifting days and running days. Th, Sa, M are lifting days for me and F, Su, Tu are days when I run 3 miles or so. When I get home from work I use a pre-workout for lifting days to get a little bit more intensity and then I use GFuel for the running days. I can take a serving between 5:30-6:30 and I can still get to sleep at 10 easily. I wouldn't recommend GFuel as a preworkout for high intensity training or lifting but for normal energy usage throughout the day and before lighter workouts it does the job well. I would definitely recommend as an alternative to coffee. As far as taste the Pink Lemonade is great. Was really concerned about it tasting too sweet or tart but it really isn't either. I'm not a huge fan of lemonade usually because of the tart aspect to it but GFuel nailed the flavor on the Pink Lemonade. The Lemon Lime is also pretty good and would recommend it as another flavor option but if you are only buying one tub do yourself a favor and get the Pink Lemonade.\n",
      "Its a realy good energy drink. Works better than coffee or Red Bull.\n",
      "But I think its not a pre-workout drink. If you mix it with Beta-Alanine and other engrediens,  then you can use it before Workout. \n",
      "Its just e replacement for sugar energydrinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried this G Fuel stuff because a lot of people on Instagram take it/advertise for it, so I said ***** it why not. The mistake I made was thinking this stuff was a pre-workout, it is NOT. Gamma Labs makes a pre-workout mix, but bodybuilding.com doesn't offer it yet. Anyways, G Fuel is a good alternative to energy drinks or coffee. It certainly wakes you up, but you don't get jittery, you also don't get that tingly rush through your veins like you do with a pre-workout. I tried the Blue Ice flavor since everyone bends over backwards to tell you how great the flavor is. I personally didn't think the flavor was all that, I felt like it tasted like cheap candy, but it certainly isn't nasty. It's very easy to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got this because I was looking for something to use as an energy drink during the day, not only pre workout.  This stuff is great.  It gives me plenty of energy, yet I do not get amped and get the shakes.  I am able to focus better and do not crash.  The taste is good and it mixes very easily.  I use a shaker usually, but the few times I had to stir it in a glass, everything mixed up with no candies in the bottom.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Fruit punch is my favorite.  I also like the lemon lime.  I got a sample of each flavor and all of them were good, those 2 were just my favorite. \n",
      "By far I feel G-Fuel is one of the best energy products on the market now today. I gave me smooth clean energy, no crash and effectiveness lasted for hours with no jitters either. Mixes very well with no residue or \"floaters\" Highly reccomend this product for either being in need of getting rid of that 2 o'clock feeling or as a pre-workout drink. I used for both and results were great. All flavors tasted great with no bitterness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Best fat burner in the market. It's all natural, doesn't feel like you took anything, curbs your appetite, and easy to swallow capsules.\n",
      "Great multivitamin!!! Organic with no fake ingredients. I feel great when using this vitamin. Works well with other supplements. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great product, recommended!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great ALL natural protein powder, this one also has enzymes and pro-biotics to help with digestion. This is a must have for me! \n",
      "Yeah, we know. Tastes like hell. They all do if they're any good. Having been a semi-pro goalkeeper I've literally eaten a lot of grass. Yup pretty much the same taste. Here's the trick, about 6 oz. of orange juice. I like Tropicana 50 since it's half the sugar and only 50 calories. You want enough OJ to thin in out, but no more than you can swallow in one swig. Since your taste buds can only process something after you've swallowed you only have to endure the nastiness once and the tartness of the OJ cuts that pretty well.\n",
      "Great product, I would have given it a 10 but it does not taste great. I do at it to my protein drink however and it does not taste bad to me no matter what flavor I add it too. I love that it gives me many nutrients that I may be missing otherwise :)\n",
      "This is a catch 22 product, it is amazingly nutritious but has a  less then desirable taste lol\n",
      "When I ordered this product, I was afraid that I would not be able to stomach the taste. I will say that the taste is strong. However, I just added a scoop of this to my protein smoothie and it turned it green, but the taste was mild when mixed with fruit, milk, and all of the other things that I add to my smoothie. I liked it! It really is a good product!\n",
      "Outstanding green food supplement.  I have been taking Maximum Greens, Light Force Greens, and Myo Greens for a couple of years and this by far the best green food supplement I have ever taken.  \n",
      "This is an outstanding greens product, arguably the best out there. The profile is great and the antioxidant power of this product is off the charts. The taste is pretty nasty but if I put some water in my mouth and put a heaping teaspoon (not TOO heaping) on top of the water I find that I can swallow it with only a small minority of it ever touching my tongue so it's not like it's all that hard to get down. All greens products taste horrible anyway so if you want anything like this there's really no getting around it regardless of what brand you choose as far as i know.\n",
      "Garden of Life makes the highest quality supplements I've found. The taste is very &quot;green&quot; so I highly recommend mixing it with something. My preference is to add some with my protein powder before shaking it up. That being said, I've found that this stuff is great for the immune system. It also aids in faster recuperation after workouts. I keep it on hand at all times and highly recommend it, no matter what form you choose to buy it in.\n",
      "It has a very strong taste which at times can be hard to drink but the benefits make it worth while. This greens has no fillers with excellent ingredients. The king of all greens.\n",
      "I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! I love the fact that they are vegetarian caplets (personally I dislike Capsules!), natural, and that IT WORKS! This product has made me regular and every trip is a smooth sailing. It has helped me with digestion as well, I'm lactose intolerant and red meat seems to really bloat me. I take it 30mins to an hour before I eat. I highly recommend it to those that are always constipated or have a hard time doing the DO! Note: it doesn't work like a laxative so don't really expect to live around a restroom for the first few times you take it... I know some say it gave them diarrhea the first time they took it. I didn't get that effect AT ALL!\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the ingredients in this protein, but the texture is really gritty.  If I can get pass the texture, I do like the coffee flavor.  I can't say I see a difference since using this product as I'm in the early stages of my journey (3rd week into Jamie Eason's LiveFitTrainer).\n",
      "I like this protein because it maintained my body weight, but it made me look leaner. It's protein but also weight management product because of the green coffee extract in it. I am not trying to loose or gain weight so it's perfect for me. If I were to take the whey protein I would gain pounds,  but this one has no whey, it's rice protein and other goodies. I like unflavored one, the coffee one tastes bad so wouldn't recommend. If you are vegetarian this is the protein to go for.\n",
      "Love this product. Taste great. Great meal replacement. Great for a lean protein weight loss if that is what you are going for. \n",
      "Not a very taste full mix at all \n",
      "I LOVE this stuff. I was worried it would taste bad based on some of the reviews, but I think it tastes amazing (and actually keeps me full!). Before going vegan, I tried numerous whey/casein protein powders, which included some pretty nasty tasting ones, so I was shocked by how great this tasted in comparison. Here's the thing: if your definition of \"tastes terrible\" includes things that taste bitter/chemically, then this stuff doesn't taste terrible. The people who think this tastes terrible are the people who aren't used to or don't like \"healthy\" or \"green\" tasting things. If you can handle a shake with a couple handfuls of spinach or kale blended in, you can handle this stuff. Try it with some frozen bananas, yum. \n",
      "Awesome, I feel great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go plants!\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the flavour it tastes like raw cocoa when mixed with water and it is definitely a complete meal. I mix half of scoop with 12 oz water but you can add unsweetened almond milk and other fruits to thicken and sweeten the content, but I love it. It reminds me of dark chocolate. \n",
      "Great meal replacement, I have it for breakfast and after a workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though this is my first meal replacement supplement, I'm happy with it. I have a very busy lifestyle, so never have enough time to eat properly. I'm also a hard gainer so I can't get enough. 2 hours after breakfast, 2 hours before training, this stuff keeps me fed between meals. But it also supplements all of the healthy nutrients my body needs (and then some) in a big way. It tastes like rat's *** at first, but you get used to it. In fact, it starts tasting kinda good after the first few servings. They recommend 2 scoops, but it doesn't mix very well. It turns into a disgusting jelly-like goo if you don't add enough water, or if you shake it too much, or if you let it sit after shaking/before chugging. So I use one scoop with 12 oz of water minimum, and chug it IMMEDIATELY. You can feel your body and mind absorb it right away. Good stuff, but takes some adjustments. \n",
      "As an overall meal replacement, it kept me feeling full and energized between meals (I'd usually have it after my afternoon workout). Flavor wise, it's atrocious. I wound up mixing this product with another vegan protein supplement (non-meal replacement) that had much more flavor and was intended as a once-daily supplement, and now it's delicious! I also use unsweetened Almond Milk as a base -- and it's almost addicting. However, by itself mixed with almond milk ... yuck!\n",
      "\n",
      " -some ginger\n",
      " The first time I took it, I did the full serving (2 scoops) and used water. I took a sip and it tasted like grass. While I was trying to get that sip down, I had noticed my shake had gotten really thick. I tried for another sip but just couldn't. I ended up throwing it away. I found those tips on other websites that sell this product and those tips work! It has worked for me. :)\n",
      "Nice fit. Very comfortable. For me this it's not baggy. It's fits just like a nice pair of jeans would fit a normal person, but this is for big guys. \n",
      "I really had to search  around to find the exact size to buy, but finally found some help on the gasp website. \n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent multi vitamin.\n",
      "A good vitamin with everything I want. I like that there is beta alanine in the vitamin as it is better to take smaller doses more frequently throughout the day to reap the benefits. \n",
      "+Best dosage of each ingredient (if 3 pills twice daily)\n",
      "+Best form of minerals (Albion certified, Amino Acid Chelates)\n",
      "+Low price (25$ for a month)\n",
      "+Beta-Alanine Carnosyn (3200mg)\n",
      "+L-Carnitine Carnipure (2000mg)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a huge fan of this stuff, ill try the pill form next time. No matter how much food I ate before taking this it messed with my stomach big time. The orange flavor is ok and the vitamin profile seems legit, but the stomach issues will keep me from buying the powder form again. \n",
      "I believe this to be an above average multi vitamin. Gaspari Nutrition is becoming one of my favorite brands. Everything I have tried from them seems to be top quality. I like the fact that the minerals are chelated. I first received a free sample but then ordered more. These have been added to my must have supplements. I only take two a day  which seems to be enough for me.  \n",
      "So far i do like this product, i constantly switch between,orange triad & Animal Pak, I take one when i wake up in the morning, one with my lunch, and one just before dinner...  It's a solid multi. \n",
      "Great product! The s****ested serving size is 3 pills, however I only take 2 pills per day (1 at breakfast & 1 at lunch). I don't really need all of the extra nutrients. \n",
      "Your urine might be a little discolored but I make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day to minimize this. \n",
      "Also, the capsule size is huge yet it goes down smoothly due to its shape. \n",
      "I highly recommend this product. \n",
      "spending more is saving me huuuuge from buying and taking so mnay other supps and micronutrients....Love this product, nuff said!  jsut get it!\n",
      "My FAVORITE multivitamin to take.  I've been taking it for over 3yrs now & can always tell a difference in my energy when I take it & if I don't take it.\n",
      "I have taken this product for a bit and never had time to review. I like the product and feel that I have a little more \"pep\" in the gym and it gives me that little extra go for the rest of my day.\n",
      "I've been all about anavite for a couple years now and I'm surprised as to why there is not more hype. Anavite has everything you need when it comes to vitamins and minerals but its the beta alanine that seperates it from others. Its recommended (by jim stoppani) to have beta alanine throughout the day including rest days. And to my knowledge anavite is the only multivitamin that has beta alanine in it.\n",
      "Great product! I've tried a lot of different multis, and this one meets or beats them all when it comes to quality. Gaspari always delivers the best products at a great price. I sometimes try different brands when I find \"deals,\" but I keep coming back to Gaspari.\n",
      "One of my favorite multi vitamins, have a hard time finding stuff that works but have had great success with Gaspari products. Highly recommend this product for a complete multi \n",
      "this multi is hands down the best ive ever used .. it has been a valuable tool in my supplementation & w.o a doubt has increased my over all performance/endurance/recovery .. ive used this product non stop the past 3 years & will continue to use it as long as its around .. \n",
      "best multi vitiam every one needs\n",
      "I really like this multi. Gaspari NEVER fails! Yes pills are giant but, your getting a BANG for your buck. These 6 pills a day cover a lot of ground. I feel amazing! Buy it! Take it! Love it!\n",
      "I am going to go against the grain and rate this one low. for one, i dont think the product is able to make up its mind - as it tries to be a pre-workout, multi and fat burner at the same time. Secondly, i like my multi to be 'normal', not give me a tingling sensation! Thirdly (not the biggest_, this has a short expiry. Lastly, geez those tablet sizes - it literally hurts to swallow them!!\n",

      "gave me that extra push, took 3 before working-out, I felt like a beast.\n",
      "\n",
      " Love Gaspari, but i hate this product is a waste of money\n",
      "Will anavite make you slim down?\n",
      "Just picked up my 2nd bottle and noticed the pills look different. My first bottle's pill were orange color and now they look like a multi-vitamin pill. I also noticed the ingredients differ from the website here. Not sure if it is because I am located in another Country with different regulations/jurisdiction. Any how, I will post another feedback after I finish this bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This multi + had me not even notice that I forgot my morning coffee...which never happens! In other words, this multivitamin supplement makes you feel ready to go. I know I'm going to want to stay on it, but that would get pricey...which is why I gave it a 9 instead of 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "not bad alittle underdosed but ok\n",
      "I love this Supplement! I Have been taking it for over a month now and it has really made a difference! Within about 2 weeks I noticed it really speeded up my recovery process from the LCLT and even just the high doses of vitamins, and my strength got greater and greater with the beta alanine! I am even terrible at Swallowing Pills, so I just chew each pill one or two times and swallow it down with water, and it doesnt even taste bad! I highly recommend it!\n",
      "I think that Anavite is a very good product because it has a lot of vitamins and other very important things inside. At last but not least inside of Anavite there is L-Carnitine L-Tartrate that is very important for a bodybuilder.\n",
      "Almost finished with this product and I have got to say, It's one of my favorite! I'm getting ready to pipeline for Pararescue and this has by far taken my training to the next level. Highly recommended!\n",
      " over all its much better than any other multivitamins in the market i have used yet.\n",
      "Favorite Multi to date. Have triad animal pak, orange triad, allmax nutritions multi and others.... annavite stands out in terms of results \n",
      "I love this multi. The added L carnitine and beta Analine makes it the best on the market in my opinion. I actually feel alot healthier on these and haven't been sick in months. No more opti men for me.\n",
      "Great product, like a multi-vitamin on steroids!  The carnitine really seems to make difference, and splitting the beta-alanine into 2 servings as directed is smart - avoids the prickly sensation.\n",
      "Great product! i only take 2 in the morning and 2 post W/O, not the recommended 6=3+3 per day. I LOVE the Beta alanine buzz I get from it, so if your not into that than maybe its not for you. This is a staple to my supplement regiment. Will always be.\n",
      "I have used anavite for a couple years now and like it very much. I have a blood disorder and have to be on blood thinners. I have found that taking the anavite helps keep the blood stable..It also helps my energy level.\n",
      "Great stuff.Smells funny and Makes your face tingly the first few times when taking it.Feeling Great though!\n",
      "this is definitely my favorite multivitamin! i have tried others such as opti-men and NOW adam but this is by far more effective!\n",
      "I am just an average dude looking for a complete multivitamin that also helps boost energy and endurance. This seems to do the trick. It is not a ridiculous amount of pills (only 3 per dose) and they are not gigantic. The bottle says to take it twice daily, but really, once daily is enough. You can get a 2 months' supply from one bottle.\n",
      "very good may dull down the effects of your pre work out but besides that impressed with on going energy throught out the day\n",
      "This has been a good multiple. Even on my pre contest diet I have had good energy during work outs. On my second bottle. It would be a 10 if it wasnt so expensive.\n",
      "This stuff smells and tastes absolutely horrible! I gag every time I have to swallow these things. I also haven't had any noticeable difference since switching over to these vitamins.\n",
      "Love this product, works great special if your carbs are low gave me a boost to get though my workout when I had been dieting for 8 weeks.\n",
      "I could really feel a difference once i switched from my old multi.\n",
      "This is my favorite multivitamin. It has the added support of beta-alanine and Carnipure to aid in recovery! Easy to swallow. I highly recommend this multi-vit to everyone and anyone regardless of your experience level.\n",
      "I am in my 4th bottle of Anivite; i have tried all of the most popular and recomended multis and this one stands out the most; great over all healty feeling all day and great recovery when taking that second serving on work out days! i did notice a difference in muscle gain and performance!\n",
      "This is a great Multi~ It has clinical (not whimpy) doses of Beta Alanine and Carnitine. Really, the vitamin/mineral complex is worth the money as it is and with these other two, it is a great deal and most of all, It works! If you are needing a boost in your recovery time, get this as you will not be disappointed. As you will see mentioned all over the net, you really can't go wrong with any Gaspari Supplement. This is coming from someone who is NOT a rep so no bias here.\n",
      "best multi-vitamin available. 3 tabs twice daily, making sure my body is getting fed the proper amounts throughout the day. has your daily values of L-Carnitine, and Beta-Alanine at the clinically proven doses. helps me absorb nutrients and keep a natural feel good energy level throughout the day. its a staple and staying in my stack for good\n",
      "Solid profile. More than just a multi. Reasonable price. Easier to take than the Pak. Boom.\n",
      "\n",
      "ONE OF THE BEST MULTI'S I EVER TRIED OUT I CAN FEEL THE PRICKLING IN MY SKIN BECAUSE OF BETA AND CARNITINE AWESOME PRODUCT MY ENDURANCE IN THE GYM IS GREAT\n",
      "Being 52 years old, I've had frequent experiences of my body struggling with the workload of lifting weights. Taking this product has minimized that struggle, and it seems to aid with my progress of getting fit and muscular.\n",
      "All I can say is, Rich, once again you've outdone yourself! Finally, a multivitamin that I can actually feel working. In 3 short weeks I've noticed the muscular endurance in my legs while running and walking long distances increase dramatically! The energy jolt from this multivitamin is very noticable as well. A well deserved 10 out of 10!\n",
      "Love this multi. It has your standard dosages of crucial vitamins and minerals but sets itself apart with the addition of the beta alanine and patented Carnipure. Great overall multi!\n",
      "A fine and highly bio available vitamin/mineral source. The Beta Alanine will improve stamina and lactic acid resistance while the Carnipure will reduce muscle damage and oxidation due to intense workouts. The cap technology sure works minimizing BA's tingling sensations.\n",
      "Amazing Multi Vit with the Argine it gave me a pump that lasted through the day!\n",
      "Another excellent product from Gaspari! I experienced great pumps during my workouts after using this product and you can feel it working almost immediately.\n",
      "Really like this.  Easy to take doesn't taste like crap unflavoured powder or powder with artificial crap in it.  The vit b6 and the ratio make it my favourite BCAA\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed that my recovery time was actually better and even though it is a big pill to swallow, I only had to take one but it was plenty enough for me twice a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: These BCAA's actually worked for me, I mainly noticed a quick recovery time, very little soreness the day after a tough workout after taking these!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: Pills are big\n",
      "Product does what it says and is relatively inexpensive compared to others. High Leucine content is a plus and the extra B vitamins don't hurt, I usually take them throughout the day when needed. Highly recommend. \n",
      "I alternate between power BCAA and this product because I'm trying to minimize all the artificial sweeteners in most power BCAA.  Love the 4:1:1 ratio!\n",
      "As in all Gaspari products i find they work .I use these for portability easier then powders breaking and spilling  etc Nice addition to my supplement arsenal i have noticed an increase in muscle look and size since adding to supplement program\n",
      "Although the pills are a tad large to swallow seeing as you take 6 they cover your bcaa requirements. Definatley recommend them.\n",
      "Great product , easy to swole\n",
      "Excellent product!\n",
      "excellent supplement helps with recovery, I use also glutamine on side and combo is awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Easy on the stomach.  I have used many other brands that have caused intestinal problems but this product does not. I stack this with Primaforce Cissus and cut my recovery time in half.\n",
      "These are great. You can take them anytime and get your BCAA's. High dose and the b vitamins are really a plus for energy. I take these with every meal by breaking the reccomended dose in half. I use a BCAA powder as well but sometimes you don't feel like a shake. Portable!!! Great stack with the Anavite by Gaspari.\n",
      "All brands are good but this is great!!\n",
      "Love all products of Gaspari Nutrition \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a firm believer in glutamine for recovery. I take 10g a day and it really cuts down on soreness. This product is great - each scoop is 5g and since it is flavorless you can mix it with anything. \n",
      "I began using Glutamine about 3 weeks ago.  It can be mixed with other supps. as it truly is tasteless.  It is weird how tasteless it really is.\n",
      "I mix it with Gaspari Glycofuse at the end of my workout and have noticed recovery time and soreness is only 24 hours, rather than 48 or more.  They are incredible together.    Never had this kind of performance from any other recovery supplement, and I have tried a few. \n",
      "Have started seeing growth again, as well,  after being \"stuck\" for a while.  I love it.\n",
      "I would recommend this to any serious lifter.  \n",
      "I don't review product much but the PB Cookie tasted horrible...never getting it again. I will accept 1% more or less of the carb/fat ratio to enjoy the taste. I found myself adding 1/2 to 1 scoop of a different protein powder to make it taste better.\n",
      "This used to be a great protein, in fact my favorite. Now unfortunately is horrible. They made some sort of change to the formula and it now taste horrible. \n",
      "Excellent Protein supplement and taste off the hook, it taste so good it feels like you are cheating\n",
      "This is one of the very best shakes I've ever tried! It has a very creamy consistency, even when just mixed with water, and it tastes sweet, but not overly so. I have mixed it with milk a few times when I have needed more calories post-workout and then it's really a treat. Excellent product, great smooth consistency, mixes up fast, really excellent!\n",
      "Good pre-workout, great post workout. Great taste, easiest mixing I've tried. I buy 4 lb. containers for a decent value.\n",
      "A testament to the old days of Myofusion before the prebiotic stuff. Tastes pretty awesome. Contains Whey AND Casein. Very good product. One of my favorites.\n",
      "I've tried Beverly UMP, Combat Powder, Protogen, Syntha 6, and PES Select to name a few.  Myofusion Advanced Cookies & Cream flavor is by far my favorite.  Myofusion Advanced also has great macros including high quality protein, low carb, and add MCTs.\n",
      "The chocolate is amazing. You love the taste of chocolate this is quite tasty. My wife is picky about her chocolate and this is the only one she will use. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have also tried the vanilla and it is quite good as well. I would say not my favorite vanilla but pretty close It's on the sweet side for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the really gem is the benefit i have seen since using it. This is a great high quality protein. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Taste, Disolves easy and feels good to stomach and body. Good to create some great shakes. \n",
      "this mixes great in my morning smoothie - 1 scoop, 1 cup of water, 1/2 oz avocado, 1 oz cottage cheese, 5 grams peanut butter powder and 1 oz berries. it doesn't get as fluffy as when i use quest powder, but it gets much thicker than other powders i've tried. \n",
      "The vanilla ice cream is very yummy!  I like to blend it with a few ice cubes, banana, and a tablespoon of peanut butter powder to make the perfect protein smoothie. \n",
      "Great flavor and keeps me full. \n",
      "Great taste! Great results! Of the 20 or so proteins if used, this is my favorite! \n",
      "I have been a fan of MyoFusion for several years.  Thank goodness they finally got rid of that probiotic garbage and replaced it with this.  MyoFusion Advanced is excellent.  I really like that it has whey and casein which makes it a nice any-time-of-day protein  Mixes well and goes down smooth.  Seems like the real deal and my recovery time is markedly better.  I would give it max stars except that it's pretty expensive.  The peanut butter cookie flavor has lots of great reviews but I personally didn't care much for it.  Tastes like old school vanilla from the mid 90s in my opinion.  Not horrible but I will get the chocolate flavor next.  I will be purchasing this again.\n",
      "\n",
      "***UPDATE*** Gaspari Nutrition has come under fire for amino acid spiking.  I will not buy any more of their products.\n",
      "10/10, no doubts. This is the best peanut butter flavored protein I have EVER tried. It taste like one of those soft rich pb cookies that a grandmother would bake for you (im serious!) \n",
      "\n",
      "I like this in greek yogurt, but it is also great for baked goods and protein cheesecakes. I would buy this again! I can't imagine how amazing the other flavors are from this brand, still have yet to try. \n",
      "I've been using the MyoFusion since 2011 while I was Deployed.   I really like that the updated product has a time released formula.  The Vanilla tastes excellent and a versatile flavor for fruit shakes, etc. A protein shake before bed is great for sleep and muscle recovery.  Add some coffee (re-chill), or (1/4cup) of coffee ice-cream! and it's a frig'n Dessert!  I'm more a plyometric/body-weight exercises, and Runner/Mtn Biker, vs mass muscle builder. I'm a minimalist supplement user, so I tend to carefully balance my food and take less (-25%) supplement than standard recommendations. I use the International Egg Whites in almost everything; this is the 'bomb' to add to a protein shake.  I also have used Gold Standard 100% Whey, but I found I prefer to add an extended release Glutamine MHP Glutamine-SR, Unflavored separate for my nighttime shake and not use glutamine during the day.  I even have my Dad (78), who is very active, having a Protein Shake before bed and he's noticed a marked difference in his sleep how he feels, so I gave him the rest of my Gold Standard.  He like the GS vanilla flavor over the Myo; to each his own.  Bottom line:  BB.com has the products we need. THANKs BB.com\n",
      "Flavor is good and taste like a peanut butter cookie but I think it could be better. Still like it lot though.\n",
      "It works well with the Protein blend. I like to take it at night or in the morning. Really I would compare it to Syntha 6 which i also love. Really i dont think you can go wrong with this stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is by far one of the best tasting Protein drinks I have ever had.  I have used many different types but I love how you can mix different fruits with it and they all taste great!\n",
      "\n",
      "Will use this going forward for sure and may even try the other flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixes well and easily. I mixed with water and creatine (micronized). Perfecto! No lumps and really, it mixes thick kind of like a shake or as if you've mixed it with milk which I love! Tastes fantastic and I don't see myself getting tired of the flavor.\n",
      "This protein definetly filled my expectations, it may not be like eating an actual solid peanut butter cookie but it's **** close, very tasty and better for me than actual cookies 😀\n",
      "So far, this has been my favorite protein. It has a great creamy taste. Probably the best taste I have found, though I have only tried Chocolate.  It also uses high quality fillers. Coconut oil CLA and MCT as the fat source. It has a blend of Whey Proteins, so all pretty fast digesting, it makes a great post workout shake. This here is my favorite for taste and quality ingredients, for a whey protein.\n",
      "By far, the best tasting protein on the market.\n",
      "Gaspari did it again!  Excellent flavor..!!!\n",
      "I have used almost every Myofusion that has been released & this Myofusion Advanced is by far the best one yet from it having less sodium, less calories, 1G sugar per serving & no label fluff what so ever and the the taste is Amazing there is not any other brand with a better taste then this protein I highly recommend you won't be dissapointed!! \n",
      "I have been using Myofusion for many years.  The newest formula definitely has great taste.  I am anxious to get some Peanut Butter Cookie Dough too!  Myofusion tastes great, mixes great, and is a staple in my supplement regimen.  \n",
      "I highly recommend against wild berry punch as it makes the lips red.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking for an intra-workout that has patents, no caffeine, and creatine.  This has all 3 and more.  It also has more than 1 creatine.  I can still sleep at night.  I get massive cramping with massive weight if I don't take this.\n",
      "I absolutely love gaspari size on. And it is a product I must have every month. So far I ran this product 2 months in a row, a long with animal M-stak and animal stak and the first month I put on 15 pounds and the second month I put on 12+ pounds and i know size on has a lot to do with it. I gained probably at least 3-6 pound from size on both months. This is a Great amino, whey, creatine blend for INTRA workout meaning during you lift. There is absolutely no othr product in its class  ( other intra supplements) that even compare to size on. It is the best in its class absolutely. And I like how it has 7g of protein and 40 g of carbs with 200 calories. This product helps with endurance while you lift, increased strength and size I would recommend this to anyone. This is another great product by gaspari. And honestly, all gasparis products are top of the line. This is good stacked with other gaspari products which I would also recommend. If I could give this more than 10 stars I would. That's how much I love it.\n",
      "SizeOn helps give me the extra energy and protein during my workout to finish strong. It helps keep my strength up and grind out those last few reps. \n",
      "I also use Gaspari Superpump Max. These two together make sure I leave it all in the gym. \n",
      "I have used Gaspari Size-On for many years when I am putting on muscle.  I enjoy that it is a intra-workout supplement.  It takes the place of a post-workout shake so I don't have to worry about drinking a post-workout shake and then a post workout protein shake.  I can just drink the whey protein after I'm done working out without having to try and properly time two shakes post workout.  The flavor is good, and it has enough carbs and electrolytes to keep you going for longer workouts that are sometimes necessary.\n",
      "The best I've tried. Love this stacked with super pump max. Haven't tried the berry flavor but all other flavored are pretty good. Other than a little expensive, the tub will last only a month, I have only great things to say. I've tried other products that aren't as expensive especially when paired with super pump and always come back to this one. It's a great stand alone product also.\n",
      "Great product!!! After comparing the results from taking SizeOn to the results of people taking other creatines i can honestly say the main difference  is the results from sizeon last even if you stop taking it for a while. With the others as soon as a person would stop taking it, they slowly dropped  back down to their original size. So if you want gains that last...try sizeon. I've used it off and on since 2006 and i continue to return to it every time. Only downfall is they never have the lemon flavor anymore!\n",
      "This stuff works great. People around me noticed immediate results. When I was in boot camp I lost a-lot of weight because they don't let you lift! But as soon as I got out of boot I hit the gym hard. I was taking super dump 250 and size on and people were accusing me of being on roids. Great ****. Any thing from Gaspari is good.\n",
      "I am all about choosing the right supplements to enhance my workouts and my progress.  I am finishing my second container of Orange Size On and have the following feedback for those interested.  I am trying to lose body fat and the process was extremely slow to me.  I started really looking at the calories, carbs, and sugar content of my supplements and weighing the overall benefit.  Size On is high in calories, high in carbs that may or may not help intraworkout, and high in sugar.  I have decided to just use a BCAA recovery type drink combined with my preworkout drink and a scoop of creatine instead, eliminating almost all the carbs, calories and sugar.  Size On does taste good, mixes well,  and probably has helped me stay hydrated and fueled up, but in the long run for me (over 40), I thought it was at too high an expense with the other ingredients.  Just be sure to check the label and make sure you are aware of the consequences of the ingredients and how it could affect you.  There is no magic pill - hard work and sticking with it is the core and your supps can enhance that along with your diet if properly combined.  Keep pushing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely like that intra-workout creatine. The orange tastes very good and mixes well. Will definitely continue to take this creatine while I try to gain some mass.\n",
      "Awesome taste. Since i began working out again my muscles have been much fuller and I've had much more strength during my workouts. Its a great addition if you're trying to gain muscle mass. \n",
      "Great product. Maybe the best supplement i have ever used. I take 1 serving immediately after my gym, with great results on size and on recovery. The taste is good and mixes easily. Highly Recommended !!!!\n",
      "This stuff works great, used it for two week and I have increased my lifting weight and reps . Flavor is great , mixes real good \n",
      "Oh SIZE-ON. This has helped me put on some size subtely during programs. I only use it when I go HARD for over an hour at the gym. It demands your shaker bottle to be absolutely filled with water, and the flavour is VERY strong, but I personally find DELICIOUS! Shake it before every sip, and you'll notice a great recovery the next day of your workout while you're doing the same thing.\n",
      "This is the best creatine I've ever taken. My friend (who's been bodybuilding for 10+ years) suggested this to me and I'm very pleased with this product. I've started seeing results within my first two weeks of taking this. The Grape Cooler flavor tastes almost like grape vitamins. I hated the taste at first but it grew on me but reason I gave a 7 is because of it taking a while to get used to flavor. The Wild Berry Punch on the other hand is AMAZING. It tastes like I'm drinking Fruit Punch Gatorade. If you're looking for some creatine, I will always suggest this. Hope this helps everyone. & don't forget drink it while working out and bring an extra thing of water to drink also. I drink this stuff between each set of every workout. \n",
      "The best intra workout product I have ever taken and it tastes great. It does exactly what it says in my experience as long as you are putting in the work. Combine that with an on point nutritional plan and you will put on size in a short period of time. I will continue to use this product, thanks Gaspari!\n",
      "Best taste and ingredients to grow and fuel during workouts. Literally crave the flavour when i work out without it.\n",
      "I love the flavor of this. Mixes easily, not gritty or clumpy. Been using this now for about two weeks, and I like the results. I'm able to lift longer and lift heavier. It keeps feeling satiated during workouts, so I feel like I'm bonking out halfway through. Overall great product. Will continue to use it. \n",
      "Great product. Keeps me hydrated and energized. Keeps me looking full.\n",
      "Tastes pretty good (like candy). Provides the amount of creatine needed for the whole day, no need for pre and post workout creatine. Really helps with recovery.\n",
      "This is my GO TO! I have tried many, many, many supplements over the years, but I can honestly say that Size On gives me the biggest results. I take Jack3d or Mass Machine 's MM200 for pre workout, and I drink Size On during my workout. \n",
      "Gaspari has hit a home run with this stuff!   Tastes great too\n",
      "I use this during my workouts it's a very good product to keep you going thru tough workouts highl recommend \n",
      "\n",
      "Easily my favorite supplement i have ever taken. Before i tore my shoulder, i went from 165 - 190 in about 3 months with proper diet of course. But size on really gives you that explosiveness in the gym. Cant wait to purchase it again. 10/10 easily.\n",
      "I am taking this to grow and gain and OMG it works!!!! LOVE this stuff!\n",
      "I love this product, its one of those  products you sip during your entire workout and you can feel the difference with the 1st time using it. I have used it off and on and it has helped me gain 30 lbs of muscle in a year  (that is with  only working during the school year, i took 3-4 month breaks from the gym during the summer just because i only had access to my school gym) i have been working out since i was a freshman in high school and i got super strong but didnt put on any size  (graduated at about 155 lbs) and when i got to college my roomate introduced me to this product starting in august and i weight 180lbs before the school year ended.... i refuse to let my supply of this ever run out, it works amazing and tastes delicious\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the grape seeds getting stuck to my blender bottle for the grape flavor it works amazing! I do like the fact that their are grape seeds in the product which means they are using mostly natural flavoring for the product.\n",
      "tasted absolutely terrible. I took one scoop during my workout and i couldn't even get through it, made me feel like crap and tasted disgusting. Just get regular creatine monohydrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to start off. It is a ***** to mix. and the sugary formula may be hard to get used to. BUT! I liked this product. I found that the insultropin sugar formula was necessary for that insulin spike which handed it over to the creatine which made my muscles feel full and ready to attack(which they did). The hydroslate protein and BCAA formula helped and electrolytes aided in recovery. I do think the amount of sugar used SLOWED up my workout, Which is a big nono. But i felt like the product, SIZE ON.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stuck at the same weight and strength, with little to no noticable muscle gains? I highly recommend using Size On as an intra-workout supplement. Just when your pre-work out drink gives out, Size On supplies your muscles just what they need to keep your energy up and therefor, your work outs more productive. I have noticed breaking through my size plateau by adding on 5 pounds of jacked muscle in just a few weeks after regularly using this product. Simple carbs supplied just at the right time = extra energy and a better body building experience.\n",
      "Excellent Product!!! I am on my 2nd tub of this stuff and its working great, really helps fight fatigue during your workout, strength gains went up quickly, and I have also put on some solid weight while using it...Definitely recommended for someone who is looking to Bulk Up\n",
      "all of my lifts have increased since taking Sizeon. I continue to go up a little each time, but it doesn't feel heavy.\n",
      "I've always wanted to try this product but never wanted to shell out the money, now I don't train without it. As someone who spends 2 hours plus per gym session I was always dragging towards the end. However with this delicious intra workout I can deliver the same intensity on the last rep of the last set as on the first sets if the day. I highly recommend this awesome product!\n",
      "I bought Size On in the sample size to get my order over the $150 mark. I was pleasantly suprised. The only way I can explain it is, it doesn't &quot;get me jacked&quot; or anything like that, but it definitely gives me the extra push when going thru a set. I definitely have more strength and stamina when working out while taking Size On. I basically stumbled across the product, but plan to add it to my program. It did work for this 47 year old.\n",
      "This stuff is great. Strange as it might sound, I used this to preserve muscle mass while losing fat. I wasn't so much looking for a change on the scale as change in the way I felt while performing body weight exercises and doing moderate-distance running (training for Marine Corps OCS). It did everything I wanted I suppose because of the creatine for recovery and BCAAs for muscle preservation. The little bit of protein is nice too. At the end of the 4 weeks of use I had boosted all weights and improved my run times. Hard to argue with that. I'll continue to use occasionally for a boost whenever I need it. Point off for price.\n",
      "I take my time in the gym and my workouts tend to take up to 2.5 hours or so before I get in the showers. Because of that I'm always worried about my body cutting out protein to nourish itself. I started taking size-on because I wanted a creatine and I also wanted something to drink during my workout to keep my body fueled. This fits the bill perfectly. I mix a full scoop with approximately 24-30 ounces of water, shake it in the car on my way to the gym, and it's completely dissolved when I get there. I can work longer and harder with no pain or soreness during or after my workouts now. I've also noticed fast gains in my bench press, curls, squats, and pushdowns since I started taking this. I stack this with MusclePharm Assault and BSN Syntha-6 protein. Just make sure you drink a lot of water. Also, this stuff seems to make me sweat profusely throughout the day, so make sure you get used to cold showers. This stuff tastes just like Grape Juice with no powdery residue or chalkiness.\n",
      "I have another shake after each workout. I stack this with creatine. Highly recommended!\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't mix well, and because it doesn't mix well that impacts the taste because you are tasting the particles that haven't dissolved. Wow, awesome gains right away, within 3 days for sure. Even though it tastes crappy, and doesn't mix well, I'll still buy it again. Trick to the mix, put the serving into a shaker cup, add 3 large ice cubes, add water, shake it up a bit, put it in the fridge for 30 minutes before your workout. It will taste better, and it will have had more time to dissolve. I would have rated it a 10, but the product is not user friendly for the reasons mentioned above. Enjoy.\n",
      "This was a great product i invested my money into. Noticed the chance in recovery. It is jammed packed with Aminos to help towards recovery/performance. Noticed the change in vascularity, and stronger faster reps i would put up!\n",
      "This supplement has become a staple in my workout routine. I've used it for over a year now and haven't switched. Initially gained a few solid pounds and boosted through plateaus in the first few weeks. Now I notice if I dont take it. I become tired much faster without the carbs and feel as if the muscles didn't receive the aminos they require. The taste is a huge improvement over the old sizeon but not quite as good as superpump max\n",
      "This product is the best post workout I've tried. My vascularity and endurance made me get the results I wanted. Not only that, It also taste really good. I recommend this product for people who want to get the results they want.\n",
      "Increases strength and endurance in the gym - Great to sip on periodically through your workout.\n",
      "This is my 2nd time purchasing Size-On, my first purchased within the past 2 months from a GNC store was Wild Berry Punch (or similar flavor name) and the taste was very palatable. I've just received this which is in a bigger container but also a bigger scoop so it's actually less servings than my other container. Also, my other didn't say it was pre-contest or max performance. Anyway, this flavor taste what I would imagine horse-**** to taste like. It could definitely benefit from a stronger lemon flavor kick. I will probably add a little lemon juice to it or lemon extract when I mix to make it a little more desirable. Otherwise, this is a great product in my opinion. I feel stronger in the gym from taking this and am able to push myself, it gives me pump as well.\n",
      "This stuff is amazing!!! I used to use the original SizeOn and thought that that was good stuff but ****. My main goal was to get mass and hold weight. I could weigh 5lbs more or less on a daily basis. The old formula was griddy and didn't dissolve all the way. It made me look and feel strong but I could never hold a steady weight. Once SizeOn Maximum Performance came out I had to try it. I instantly loved the new added ingrediants and taste. The new formula dissolves after a few shakes in the bottle, and my weight and mass went up and stayed like I wanted. Also compared to the original, I feel stronger while using the Maximum Performance and my muscles feel harder under my tight skin. Soreness is almost none while working out and after workout. This is definitely my favorite workout supplement and I recommend it to anyone wanting to look &quot;beefyer&quot; as I have been told since using this awesome product!\n",
      "\n",
      "I stack this with Superpump MAX, and I have no major complaints. It's done everything I've hoped it would. After nearly three weeks of stacking the two products I feel I've gained some muscle, also I've gotten stronger. Grape cooler tastes like those chewable flintstone's vitamins I ate as a kid.\n",
      "vitamins &amp;amp; minerals, antioxidants, amino acids, Peak ATP, OUTLAST carbohydrate blend, Creapure, Whey Hydrolysate, Creatine MagnaPower, and LOLA! just a few beneficial ingredients out of the best intra-workout supplement ever. build size, recover faster and add in some indurance to lengthen or pull you through some of your hardest workouts. great stacked with Anavite, PlasmaJet, SuperPump MAX and Myofusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using SizeOn for several workouts now, and I am extremely pleased with the results. I will be honest and say that I am heavily stacking, and so how much credit I can give to SizeOn individually is as much in question as any of the other supplements I am taking. All I can say is this flavor is delicious fruity goodness, pretty sweet, but a little more water does the trick. I feel like a machine during my workouts, pumping out extra reps and sets like never before. If nothing else, SizeOn is a great product for a Gaspari Stack! Raaaaarr!!! :D\n",
      "Just started my 1st week with this product.....I bought the Grape Cooler and it taste horrible.....but i'm mostly about results...i can deal with something that doesn't taste that great if it yields me results. Haven't really noticed much yet but again its only been a few days....I hope there is a better tasting flavor than Grape.\n",
      "The taste isnt all that great. It taste like orange juice and cheese crackers. I have notice large strength gains while using this, nothing more at this time.\n",
      "I really like Gaspari products. SizeOn is the real deal. I see and feel size in my muscles. The berry punch flavor is a little to sweet to drink during a work-out. Next time I am going to try a different flavor\n",
      "I have nothing really to say but, WOW this supplement really lives up to the hype..... nothing but positive feed back from me.....\n",
      "Works great during the workouts keeps my energy levels high, not near as fatigued, taste is great.\n",
      " I feel the quality, taste, and value for my fitness dollar is well spent here and at Bodybuilding.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "After my experience with other Gaspari products my trust towards the company has grown. I find most supplement companies extremely sketchy and with false claims and little evidence to back up their products. Gaspari has not let me down yet and especially not with Size-On Max Performance. In 2 months of using SOMP I was able to stack on 6 pounds of muscle compared to 1-2 pounds I was putting on per month earlier. This product mixes well and taste great during and after my workouts. Throw in 1/2 a scoop of Gaspari Super pump 250 into the intra-workout mix and you've got one hell of a muscle gaining pump.\n",
      "Been stacking this superpump250 and got amazing results! Although the results werent instant, i did gain an amazing amount of lean muscle and size over a period of time with consistent use of size-on. Wild berry punch tastes amazing, almost like hawaiian punch! Make sure to drink alot of water when taking this in order to maximize your results.\n",
      "This beats Cell Tech hands down. Better pump, more lean muscle acquisition and waaaaay better taste. I drink it with a scoop of SP250 and have killller workouts. I have people that know me stop and tell me that roids are bad for me.\n",
      "This was my first product with creatine in it. It has really helped out during my workouts by giving me energy and making my recovery time less. I did have some strength gains but nothing out of the ordinary. I gained 7 pounds from it in a month which is amazing but 3 of those pounds were water, but 4 pound muscle gain in a month is great. It definetly did what the name said and put size on.\n",
      "terrible terrible taste. Original size on actually had a lemon flavor. not this stuff..tastes like 2 year old orange juice. would not recommend this at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Been on this for a couple of days.... do not get fatigued at all working out, can push out some extra reps, and seems like it is great stuff so far. For those who care, it taste pretty good,kind of like an improved version of the old wild berry punch.\n",
      "I would say this product is amazing. The only thing is that when you mix it with a lot of water, it makes all of the water taste bad. Best thing to do is mix it with as little water as possiible and just down it. It is by far the best of the best... Road maps for arms and a massive pump.\n",
      "His is a great product. And has been added to my everyday workout regimen. I love it and couldn't see not using this product. Amazing benefits and makes me feel great. Stacks well with any GAT product. Especially creatine monohydrate and Nitraflex. I have extreme gains from this stack!! You should buy it and possibly the entire stack!\n",
      "The best value for money. Great pump.\n",
      "Great Product. Great serving value vs Dollar value.  Getting awesome pumps. My forearm veins are devasting. People ask how I get big veins. It must be the GAT......\n",
      "75 grams of agmatine for 24 bucks? it doesn't get much better than this. I make my own pre's and this is my favorite pump ingredient. If you're looking for an agmatine product and comparing them, nothing else can really compete with this, scoop it up before they run out!\n",
      "Actually first bottle I ordered this for try after use it i like this product then I ordered again. I saw big difference in my body. It's better than liquid.\n",
      "Great product! Can't praise it enough. \n",
      "I'll keep it simple. This ***** AMAZING!!!🎗\n",
      "I've been buying BCAA for many years now, and ever since I've I have tried this product it's the only one I buy!  I have buying GAT BCAAs for a year straight now! Great product. \n",
      "Works well. Is very effective to travel with, as it contains the BCAA's we need without the need to lug a huge jar of protein around. However, the servings go QUICK!\n",
      "Needed a BCAA that provided the minimal but the most important BCAAs. So far, I'm happy with it and have seen gains of 20 lbs since I started back in August of 2012.\n",
      "just finished with my first bottle. i can say this does curve appetite a bit. taking this product with a proper diet will help alot. at the end of the bottle i was down 4.2 lbs. \n",
      "It feels like my appetite is curbed a bit but after 2 weeks, I'm not seeing drastic results.\n",
      "Let me start off by saying, can't use any stimulant product. I get jittery, or very anxious with even too much caffeine, let alone anything like a thermogenic. This product is AMAZING! I started off with 1 pill on the first day to try it out. I'm now up to 2 pills once or twice a day and have 0 effects of jittery, or feeling like my heart is racing, or my head is pounding or any of the adverse side effects I've experienced taking other things. I have used this as a pre workout first thing in the morning, as well as a supplement right before my lunch. I can't say I've seen amazing results yet as I've only been taking this (not consistently either) for about 2 weeks. Once I get more on the roll of taking it on the regular I can post about results but finally FINALLY there is something out there peeps that does NOT make you feel like crap! This is great! Hats off to the people at this company b/c they know what they're doing! \n",
      "Excellent product helps for the added push come show time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a new GAT´s consumer, and I'm grateful to know it.\n",
      "This was recommended to me by my personal trainer and it is definitely one of my favorite fat burners, with no jitters or bad side effects. I don't normally do reviews but this product is worth it! So far I have lost 5% body fat and 7 lbs. in 2-3 weeks and still counting. 3 capsules in the morning right when you wake up with some carnitine and you're set to go. Great product!\n",
      "This does just what it says it does...a very smooth stimulant and thremo. I myself am sensitive to large amounts of caffeine and I found Jet Fuel Pryo to be easy on the stomach and nerves. I can totally feel a boost in energy and metabolism. Half way through my first bottle and I plan on making this a staple in my regimen...Love this GAT product!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have found that I do not need the full subscribed daily dose. I weigh 190lbs and 3 tablets are enough to give me the extra boost I need mid morning. \n",
      "wow, good product felt a bit to much energy due to taking two pills. taking one and feeling outstanding.... will work to 3 pills. \n",
      "Took this one to try and compare after a bottle of Hydroxycut Next-Gen. I would say this works well in terms of test boost and fat burn, but with the maximum dosage (as I am taking 3 tablets x 2 daily) my stomach gets upset after the morning dosage, and my mood gets really bad. I will be doing 2 tablets x 2 daily to see if this would ease down the side effects.\n",
      "Great product to take in the morning and getting the day going strong. Do not drink with coffee or any other caffine definatly not a good mix. Other than that all in all he pills have worked great\n",
      "\n",
      "This product did help kill my appetite but beyond that I didn't see much from it other than lots of head calls and a pretty good shot of energy in the \n",
      "I gave Jetfuel T300 a try, and was very impressed. I add muscle wait drop fat. I did not fatigue out with this product or need a nap after working out. I will continue to use this product.\n",
      "The product gives you the right amount of energy without being jittery. I would definitely order this supplement again.\n",
      "Great burner, doesn't drain your water out like other products. After your first dose you can feel some energy as well. Only one week taking this product and already seen that its working.\n",
      "worked very well and will purchase again\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good tasting and man does it help with those gains noticing gains a week  after tkaing helps with the soreness as well and doesn't make you bloat after taking\n",
      "Amazing taste.\n",
      "I just started lifting again after a 6 year absence from college football and this stuff does the trick. so far i have not found a GAT product that i do not like and i will continue to use this one and it also has a great flavor to it. I have went through 3 of these already and will continue to use it.\n",
      "Excellent product.  Mixes well and taste great.  I mix it with my Gat Nitraflex Pina Colada and Jet Mass tropical ice together before my sessions.  Nice pumps, focus, and intensity.\n",
      "This is a staple in my diet. I love it! Ive been using it for three or four years now, and still get great results from it. Not to mention the flavor. I could sip this stuff from a coconut with an umbrella on the beach\n",
      "I came back for more :) tried this for something to sip during my workouts and love it! I used to get cramps certain days during my workouts and after but not since I started this product. Tastes great and really works :)\n",
      "Taste great no complaints \n",
      "Amazing product and the taste is 10/10!\n",
      "Mixes well, great taste ...\n",
      "Helped in recovery seems to be helping in size and strength. I have only been using for three weeks but I can see and feel a difference.\n",
      "This product is one of my new favorites. It reminds me of an orange creamsicle.  I have one once a day usually sometime after my workout. My stomach can't handle a full shake and JetMass shake so I split them up. I have felt a significant increase my strength after a six week regiment of JetMass. I would highly recommend!!!! Suh Dude\n",
      "So I've recently stopped trying lose weight and I am now focusing on putting on as much muscle as possible in the next few months before trying to cut again. I asked around my gym and this is the product that I ended up purchasing and wow! After the first use, I noticed fuller and harder muscles more so than I have ever after waking up (I workout at night and I am in bed within an hour). Not to mention, the Black Cherry flavor is absolutely amazing! I will definitely continue to purchase purchase this product. \n",
      "One of the best Creatine in the market with a great taste and phenomenal results. \n",
      "I have tried two flavors; tropical ice and black cherry. black cherry is better because it hide the chemical taste and smell more thoroughly. the ice is not bad though. I have been using this product with a stack ( nitraflex, jetmass, testrol, and supertien) for about 4 weeks now and I bought it a second time because it works for me. I switched from a similar stack to this one and gained 6lbs of muscle very quickly .I use the jetmass as an intra-workout an it helps me maintain a peak physical endurance and pump in the gym for a long as my session requires.. I have read a lot negative reviews (mostly about GAT using blends) which made me a little skeptical. But I now trust this product with confidence because it works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome product see lots of gains with it and the taste of the black cherry is amazing! Highly recommend \n",
      "Amazing stuff!  Does exactly what it claims and fast. I'd give it a higher rating than 10 if I could, both in its flavor and effectiveness.  \n",
      "Everything GAT makes, tastes amazing. I don't know how German Creatine is better than anything else though. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the goofy marketing, it is a solid product. After workouts it is great. Even during the day I would be tempted to drink it. It tastes just like an orange dreamsicle. So good. Solid supplementation too. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, just like the Jetfuse NOX, there are better products out there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is outta control and mix-ability is great. \n",
      "\n",
      "great flavor and no gritty taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "Love the flavors both are delicious.  I love to mix 6oz of orange juice with 12 oz water and two scoops of orange creme its delicious perfect for post workout. As far recovery goes this products is awesome helps increase size an power. This product works like it claims.\n",
      "I love jet mass and GAT products in general. I always come back and do a cycle of jet mass.\n",
      "I love this product, I take after workouts and before bed. Had noticeable gains while using this product, I used with jet nox pre workout as well. \n",
      "I love the flavor of JetMass.  I tried it as a sample and bought some.  It tastes great and makes you want to drink it.  I have had good results.  I am up about 8-10 pounds and doing more reps.  I don't lift heavy but the reps are higher for sure.  \n",
      "So this was my favorite product I tried in 2014.  I am a fairly new comer to Creatine and this stuff had made me feel like the hulk in the gym.  Strength gains all around with improved recovery and maintaining lifts even during a mini cut.  Also, they need to show you exactly how much you get in this tub, its huge!! lasted me nearly 2 months on the first one! Very Very good value here!  Also the Orange Cream flavor is out of this world might be the best tasting supplement I have ever had.  Tropical ice is also very good but seriously the Orange is just unbeatable.\n",
      "Originally got this as a trial packet , right away got hooked on it ...currently on my second tub , great quality product , mixes and taste great .\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, the Orange Creme flavor is fantastic!  Mix-ability is awesome too!  I take this both during and after my workouts.  I've noticed an increase in my recovery and less soreness after a workout.  I've also noticed some size and strength increases.  I'm on my 6th week of this and highly recommend it.  Other reviews on here helped me decide to try it, and I'm glad I did!  Great product! \n",
      "great taste and awesome product. GAT quality...\n",
      "This is a good standalone creatine supplement. If you are looking for something that gives you more than just a creatine mono that you add to your protein mix (which I do anyway) this is a really good option. I use this as a preworkout, stacked with nitraflex or some other preworkout stim. First the combinations of different creatine chains and compounds are hard to find readily available at this price elsewhere. Like I said if you are look for the step up from the cheap stand alone creatine supplement, this is it.  I have mixed this with the nitraflex fruit punch and drink it together before working out, luckily its not too heavy on the stomach and the flavors actually taste really good together. Just drink more water if you do it that way. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this to intermediate lifters who are branching into the supplement world. Daily creatine and protein go a long way when sustaining daily lifting workouts and keeping muscle gains.\n",
      "I really enjoyed drinking this every day after the gym. I def put on muscle as people at work have noticed my arms, shoulders and chest getting bigger. I have gained about 5 lbs but look thinner than before so it's a big plus to my workout routine! Tastes so good too! Dissolves so easily and is a small serving so it's easy to bring anywhere. I will def. Be using this product again after my 2nd container is gone. Thx jet mass!!\n",
      "Tried from sample, purchased. Like the flavor, will continue to use. I'm still on my first container, Mixes well, tastes great. Not sure how effective since I am still using it. I do like it enough that I would repurchase.\n",
      "great product overall\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the Best Tasting Supplements out there. Great creatine. I always notice the gains. \n",
      "I give it a 7.5, If it wasn't a prop blend I may rate it higher.... \n",
      "Awesome stuff that actually works.  Both flavors are awesome as well.\n",
      "JETMASS has moved my training to the next level. After only a couple weeks of using JETMASS my muscles became fuller and my strength reached an all time high. JETMASS has an amazing taste and unllike other creatine supplements it mixes extremely well leaving no gritty residue. This is a product that I recommend to all my friends. Great product GAT. \n",
      "Decent creatine, it does the job\n",
      "This product tastes great and really works. I have been taking it after my workouts and can tell the difference since I have been taking it. I recommend this product.\n",
      "JETMASS really works, does everything the label claims.  Significant improvements in strength and recovery in as little as two weeks.  The Orange cream tastes like an orange ice cream Popsicle, the best tasting supplement that I have ever tasted, by far.\n",
      "It worked great for me.\n",
      "Have used products that contained citrulline malate in the past and have read up on its benefits.  This however did not seem to do anything for me, nothing noticeable at least, I will give it the benefit of the doubt that I was ingesting something that helped my body and give 6 of 10.  The taste if taken with just water is a almost salty or acidic which is not an issue, it kinda ruined the taste of my protein shakes if i mixed it in there, and did not notice taste with my pre as pretty much inhale pre instead of tasting it.  Product also seemed to have less servings than advertised.\n",
      "first time trying this. Honestly it's alright, not going to pack on pounds! But I did notice a big difference in my endurance. I Mix it with my aminos in the morning upon awakening a weird taste but it gets the job done for a good price!\n",
      "Not a hug boost but I do feel some . Good for the price . Mix with the pre work out taste is a little soury but not awful\n",
      "This is a great tasting pre workout even if you shoot it raw \n",
      "The pump I get from it is pretty good but I don't get that stinging feeling or jitters, dosent have a major crash and is pretty good all around, one thing is that it takes a good 35 min to kick in and takes an hour to peak so I would take it a good 20 min before your warm up\n",
      "Awesome DGA. Easy to use and had nice vascularity and pump when taken prior to high carb meals. Highly recommended for someone for wants to shuttle down more nutrients to his muscles and lose fat!\n",
      "With this product I have noticed that the energy in my body is much improved.\n",
      "Ok product but expected much more powerful stimulant pre! I tried better stimulant pre-workouts like alphamine which much better focus and energy!!!\n",
      "Strongest pre workout I've had to date, which is saying a lot because I've tried almost everything. This is for the \"STIM junkies\" only, I was suprised by this product. The energy is intense, very intense, and so is the focus. Tastes incredible to be so potent, HIGHLY recommend to anyone who is looking for something to kick them in the a$$\n",
      "Great Product\n",
      "I have built up a tolerance but this pre goes beyond any I've ever had. (Besides OG Jack3d) \n",
      "I have nothing but positives to say about this product. I've tried all the flavors except the Red Wine. I really enjoy Blue Colada. It really tastes like coconuts and that's cool. But yeah, it's worth it in my honest opinion.\n",
      "I wanted to find a natural BCAA with no sucralose in it so I tried Gnarly Berry Lemonade. The flavor is very good just not really sweet. I would definitely recommend it.\n",
      "Very comfortable waist trimmer with excellent quality.I am happy with the product and I do recommend those who are looking to tone their abs and as well as back support for any activity.\n",
      "Pleased with product.  Much better than other waist trimmers that I have used.  I have recommended this product to a couple of friends and they are happy with the referral.  \n",
      "Although this product helped my core visibly sweat  much more, I do not use it anymore because the velcro mechanism used to keep the waist trimmer in place securely and tight has worn out and doesn't stick anymore unless I wear my shorts over it a little. \n",
      "\n",
      "Things to consider\n",
      "- As results are concerned, I believe it makes your stomach look slimmer to a certain extent, but that's because of the extra sweat it causes in the area of where you wear it. (I still believe diet, cardio/ab work-outs are the best results; this gives an extra bonus to those methods)\n",
      "- If you care about how you look in the gym, this is a bit bulky, but at times no one would notice I was wearing it; but it depends on the clothing you wear. \n",
      "This by far is my favorite waist trimmer.Makes my fat cry twice as much than a regular waist trimmer does and I love it!  :)\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor is absolutely terrible, would not recommend to anyone. It was supposed to be orange pineapple but it was more like orange peels and the skin of a pineapple. Super bitter. I was only able to take a sip or two before I decided not to take it anymore. disgusting taste.\n",
      "Pump is about like any other PWO like NO xplode or C4 but **** that taste bro,  I don't know if I got a bad batch or what but it tasted super bitter and almost soapy.  Never again.\n",
      "The first few times Ive taken it, I loved it. After about 2 weeks (taking it 3 times a week) I noticed I was struggling to swallow it. The Orange pineapple is awful. Wild punch is slightly more tolerable. I can't drink a whole serving anymore, it's too sweet tasting.\n",
      "Performance wise it's pretty good, although I wouldn't say great.\n",
      "The Orange pineapple flavor is NEW!!!! I did love the old Orange Onslaught flavor that was much like orange tang, but this new orange pineapple is very tasty!! And Boy OH  BOY does it pack a punch!!!! 400 mg of caffeine per servings with a variation of 3 different sources. I am also a fan of the Huperzine ingredient, I really feel it improves my focus and cognitive performance overall!!!!!!\n",
      " I am typically not a huge fruit punch flavor fan, but since i ran out of Orange Pineapple flavor then i have been using the Wild Punch 50 Cal flavor and its grown on me, if you are a Fruit punch fan then FO Shizzle give this a go.....cuz it sure packs a Punch!!! hah\n",

      "This product, while cool named, doesn't give me the push in my workout as much as id like it too. Unfortunately, It does however, keep you up at night even if you went to the gym at 5. for those days- 2 scoops- is way to much. Not for the gym time but for after. \n",
      "\n",
      "I literally had to pair this with something else to get the same effect as some others ive taken. Too much Caffeine, and not enough everything else. \n",

      "My suggestion, is to buy the small packs and try it before you buy the large tub. \n",
      "\n",
      "It should also be cheaper for what you get. but at least $5. and to be honest. Smelling salts have a bigger effect. Just sayin and they can be had for $7\n",
      "\n",
      "it might work for some, but not as well as id like for me. Compare before you buy\n",
      "I try a lot of different pre workouts I would rank this one as a little above average. It's not bad and not great, gives a decent pump but does not last through the entire workout which is typically a little over an hour. \n",
      "Works great. Made me pumped up! Pushed out more reps. Not a huge fan of the flavor but it's a lot better than fruit punch. More flavor choices would be better\n",
      "Had been taking PRE-KAGED for over 6 months, but couldn't handle the serving size/volume it had to be taken in, but I wanted a clean pre-workout with a good profile, at least with the essentials that PRE-KAGED had. I have been using Grenade products for over a year now, so I decided to try the new .50 Caliber, because of it's revamped ingredient list. I was positively surprised/impressed by the strength/pump/focus it gave me, was easy to digest/absorb and felt no irritations whatsoever in my GI tract. Busted quite a few PRs with this. A must try PWO\n",

      "These are alright. Decent flavor. A little tough to chew. I don't think these should be in the elite protein bar conversation.... They were alright, but for the money, there are a lot better options.\n",
      "The only bar I loved . Amazing quality and taste \n",
      "This wasn't the worst protein bar I've had, but it wasn't good by any means. When I unwrapped the bar it looked good (coated in chocolate), then I bit halfway into the bar and thought, \"so far so good\" (top part of bar contains the chocolate cream, which tastes good), then got to the protein section underneath and that's where the taste ends (literally tastes like nothing, just a bland white bar of protein). Now, the carmel chaos flavor was actually decent to eat, it didnt have the bland protein taste as did the chocolate cream.\n",
      "These are really good. similar nutrition profile as another major brand on this site. These bars taste great, so do the Crunch bars. However, These are better because I can eat them in the car without the chocolate crumbling and getting all over my clothes and car seat.\n",
      "I love that this bar has 23 grams of protein. It is a little bit chalky and do I think it tastes just like a Snickers? Heck no, but it isn't dry, the caramel adds a nice texture with the chocolate crunch and it is low on sugar. It's a great bar for when you are on the go.\n",
      "\n",
      "These aren't bad. I think if you're comparing taste only to Quest or Combat Crunch bars these fall a bit short though. To me the Caramel Chaos has a little bit of a cardboard/chaulky taste but overall it's not bad. It's just going to be about finding the right bar for your needs/nutrition desires (if you can even call it that from a protein bar..) I'd order them again if they were on sale but because these are more of a treat for me I'd probably stick to something that I actually enjoy the taste of. \n",
      "This has become my favorite protein bar. I have never taken much issue with the taste of protein bars, but more so the texture. Other protein bars I had tried often felt like I was biting into a rock. On top of that, the bite often ended up in crumbs getting all over the place. That does not happen with these bars. The taste is fine and they are easy to bite into. My only recommendation would be to not store them in a garage that gets hot in the summer because they will indeed melt. Long story short, Grenade has become my go-to protein bar.\n",
      "These bars are by far the best I have ever had!! Tastes like a candy bar and not like a protein bar and the protein is high and just ingredients are rite on I am deffinetly going to order these bars again and again as a matter of fact I already ordered another box!!\n",
      "Carmel tastes like a candy bar. Isn't  hard or overly chewy like other bars and the macros are spot on. \n",
      "Love that the protein outweighs the carbs. Chocolate cream tatse very similar to a Twix bar, which really helps me with my sweet tooth while dieting.\n",
      "Nutrition facts are amazing! Taste is really nice! \n",
      "Maybe not the best tasting protein bar(can be 2nd after combat crunch bars) but definitely I will order that one again too.\n",
      "\n",
      "My last purchase I made on the site was a mix of different brands and flavours of protien bars. The chocolate cream was by far the best bar I have had. It resembles more of a chocolate bar than a protien bar. If flavour is a concern to you, I would highly recommend this bar. It has a creamy layer, crunchy layer and then your nougat type layer all covered in chocolate. \n",
      "Great choice when you're craving a chocolate candy bar! But better for you lol It reminded me of a snickers. Definitely recommend to kill a craving.\n",
      "Fantastic protein bars that taste and texture are borderline with chocolate bars, but with none of the guilt. Great amount of protein and add variety to meal plans. Can't recommend Caramel Chaos and White Chocolate Cookie enough.\n",
      "These bars taste exactly how I want a protein bar to taste. I love the texture of them the most, as they are not hard and too chewy. I preferred the chocolate cream over caramel chaos, but they both satisfied my cravings. I love the amount of protein per bar, and I can easily slip these into my macros. If they ever went on sale, I would purchase a box right away!\n",
      "What an incredible bar!  You have to try it in the microwave- just nuke it for about 20-25 seconds.  Pure, delicious low-carb / high protein heaven.  Hard to eat just one.\n",
      "I like these protein bars. I think they are ok. Flavor is good and makes for a nice snack.\n",
      " After jumping on the keto train, these are my go to snack.  Great taste and  minimal carbs.  Love them \n",
      "tried both flavors, will definately order again. Great taste and texture.\n",
      "I was sent a free sample of chocolate cream and Carmel chaos when I bought my grenade protein powder and quest bars. I must say, these grenade protein bars are AWESOME! I didn't think i would find a bar I would enjoy as much as the cookie dough quest bars, but these just might have beat it. Next time I'm purchasing bars I'm going with the carb killas for sure.\n",
      "these bars taste just like a chocolate bar unlike so many of the low carb protein bars, and with just 1.4g of sugar. absolutely love these :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Bars have a good flavor but are a bit chalky. Good protein source when on the go.\n",
      "Tastes great! I got two for free when I ordered grenades ration packs. I would definitely take two more free ones, eat them, and probably enjoy them just as much.\n",
      "This is my first time writing a review on here, but this bar is so good it deserves a review! I find MusclePharm's Combat and Quest bars to be too chewy, but the Carb Killa bar is just the right amount of chewiness with REALLY GOOD FLAVOR. I got the chocolate cream and it really tastes like a chocolate candy bar. For those who are on a low-carb diet, this is a good bar. I usually eat this as a mid-day snack or in the morning when I'm on the go, and it really helps keep me full. I would say this bar ranks up with my other favorite bar, Robert Irvine's FIT Crunch bars (for when I need to load up on carbs). I look forward to buying some of the other flavors of Carb Killa. \n",
      "One of my new favorites. I swear I'm eating a candy bar when I grab one of these and that's pretty much exactly what I look for in flavor. Great soft texture as well. \n",
      "I actually threw it away after a couple of bites because of the taste. \n",
      "At 60g and 210 calories, these bars satisfy my craving for a snack. They aren't full on meal replacement bars, but they are large enough to satisfy any sweet tooth and not crash your macros. An interesting thing that I noted with these bars is where they get the carbohydrates from. Many low sugar bars replace the sugar with either fiber ( IMO's or Corn Fiber ) ie. Quest bars, Victory Bars, Combat Crunch; or with sugar alcohols ( Malitol, Sorbitol, Xylitol ) ie. Fit Crunch, and my favorite Think Thin bars. My issue with those types of bars is because they use so much fiber or sugar alcohol, your gut sometimes may pay the price. However, the Carb Killa bars don't overload on either of these carbohydrates, they split the difference; 7 grams of fiber and 11 grams of sugar alcohol which plays a lot nicer in my stomach at least. The texture of these bars is very enjoyable. In my experience, Quest bars tend to be soft and chewy; and Combat Crunch bars, hard and crunchy. The Carb Killa tends to fall in between the texture of those bars. It has a crunchy chocolate shell that isn't hard with a soft chocolate and nougat center that isn't too chewy. This bar would melt in your mouth if you wanted it too, but because of it's flavor, it won't last long enough to melt. The taste of Chocolate Cream Carb Killa reminds me of a Milky Way bar, if the Milky Way bar had a chocolate center instead of caramel. The shell is chocolate with a chocolate cream layer, almost like a ganache, on top of a soft nougat filling. The chocolate cream is hard to see in my photo because the shell got crushed as i ate it. While it is chocolate on top of chocolate, and the chocolate flavor is strong, there is just enough creamy flavor to balance out the bar and not be overpowering.\n",
      "\n",
      "These bars are delectable. A sure fire add to any collection of a chocolate lover. I would recommend these bars to anybody.\n",
      "These bars have been receiving a lot of praise, and rightfully so.  Packing a mere 210 calories yet still containing 23 g of protein, Grenade's Carb Killa bars are a true treat.  I've had both flavors that are available currently (Caramel Chaos and Chocolate Cream), and both are unique in their own way.  Surprisingly, Caramel Chaos doesn't pack as much of a caramel taste as you would expect due to the name, but it still has loads of gooey caramel packed inside.  Chocolate Cream is my favorite of the two, and has a shortbread-like cookie cream cream center.  Both are layered with chocolate crisps, a layer of caramel, and a thin chocolate coating.  Few bars can stand toe-to-toe with the flavor of the Carb Killa bars.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "Just tried the chocolate cream carb killa bar and I must say it's not quite as tasty as the caramel chaos flavor but still worth buying. Has a candy bar like taste and gives you that delicious chocolate flavor that you're craving. Not chalky, chewy or hard to force yourself to choke down. A very good bar overall, that I'd recommend everyone to try at least once. I don't think you'd be disappointed for a bar that's not too high in calories and low in carbs.\n",
      "very tasty, does not feel like you are eating a healthy bar. \n",
      "I like the texture and crunch of this new protein bar but overall the still slightly chalky taste just didn't live up to the advertisement hype that arrived in my inbox in my opinion. I've been looking for ways to give these away and will not order again. Combat's chocolate chip is far more flavorful, soft and has 12 grams of fiber instead of the seven that these bars have. Still better than most protein bars that are out there but just not as good as advertised which leads me to be more cautious the next time Bodybuilding.com raves about a new product.\n",
      "Nothing extraordinary really, wouldn't buy them again. Combat crunch bars my favorite.\n",
      "Very tasty protein bars! Macros are excellent as well! I will be ordering these bars again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really good tasting bar.  Great for right after a workout or as a quick meal substitute.  \n",
      "One of the most tasty protein bars! Surely will reorder. Perfect before trainings.\n",
      "Good tasting and just the right size for a snack.\n",
      "These are really good. Not too sweet, a bit of a crunch and a slight caramel flavour. You can definitely eat more than one if you're super hungry so beware!\n",
      "Pretty good tasting protein bar. Not super sweet. Would definitely recommend. \n",
      "23 grams of protein makes it one of the higher grams of protein bars.  My husband likes it more than some of the other bars because it is not super gross sweet.  \n",
      "I'll keep it short. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have never EVER tasted a protein bar this tasty. It has created a big problem for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "How do I keep my hands off it? \n",
      "Best tasting Low Carb bar I've tasted. Found it hard to believe that there are only 2g net carbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prefer these over Quest.\n",
      "best tasting protein bar ever. and with informed choice on the side you know they are very good.grenade got thees perfected.  \n",
      "Just bought these the other day. They have to be the best protein bars that I've tried. They taste like something you shouldn't be allowed to enjoy when you're watching what you eat :)\n",
      "I was really excited to try carb killa and really disappointed after trying.\n",
      "when i opened the wrapping, the bar looked old as almost expired.\n",
      "took a bite and it was so hard, could not take the second bite with my front teeth.\n",
      "it did not taste anything close to something special, honestly...I had much better bars and many of them. this one is not even in my top 5.\n",
      "probably won't buy this bar again.\n",
      "I bought one bar at first to see if I would like it, well I looove it, you cant even tell its a protein bar, and the macros are excellent!!! would definitely buy and recommend.\n",
      "I have tried several protein bars and this is by far the best tasting one. \n",
      "Simply one of the best protein bars in the market.\n",
      "I usually like to use the quest nutrition protein bars and they were pretty good, but this protein bar doesnt even seem like a normal protein bar its more like a candy bar. I have to say the grenade carb killa is the best protein bar i have tried based on flavor and texture. i would recommend that you at least add one bar to your next order and give it a try.\n",
      "I bought this 3 days ago, and I've already ate 5 bars. This protein bar is so **** good that I don't even know how they made it healthy. It's so good it's addicting. It taste exactly like a cross between a KitKat and a Snickers. You will get addicted. Be warned.\n",
      "The taste was amazing! I felt like I was eating a actual candy bar. The fact that it is low in carbs is a plus!\n",
      "Amazing taste, relatively lower on carbs and fats than other bars. But seriously tastes better than actual chocolates\n",
      "Made quite significant gains with the use of this plus Grenade Hydra 6. Used other creatines and felt bloated, dehydrated but feel good with this. Would buy for the taste alone, mixes pretty well - nicer in about 150ml water, but then make sure to drink more after. \n",
      "One of my favorite blended protein. Great mixability! I have never had any issues with this blending smoothly.\n",
      "CHOCOLATE CHARGE-Amazing chocolate taste with crunchy chocolate bits in it!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "STRAWBERRY SEIGE-Tastes like strawberry nesquik with bits of freeze dried strawberrys\n",
      "\n",
      "KILLA VANILLA- I mix this with OJ to make an amazing Orange Creamsicle shake\n",
      "Excellent protein powder, and a great less-expensive alternative to ProJym (minus the egg protein). The blend of whey and casein means you get both the fast- and slow-absorbing protein you need, and that you can even take it before bed without having to purchase a separate casein. The profile itself is simple and clean without any spiking or fillers, and the 2 flavours I've tried so far are both excellent (strawberry being one of the best flavours of any protein I've ever tried). Looking forward to trying the chocolate next. The powder itself blends easily and smoothly, becomes thicker due to the added dairy creamer, and fills you up without bloating. My new favourite supplement!\n",
      "This is as solid as you can buy for a protein shake. If you lift you NEED both Whey and Casein protein in your diet and this has 12g of each. Whey is fast acting and needed right after a lift and Casein slowly acts and is needed through out the day (since I lift in the morning), and this has both - 50/50. Most protein blends do not tell you have much of each type of protein is in it and since Isolate and Casein are more expensive for companies there is really no telling how much is in protein unless it is listed like Grenade does. This has Whey Isolate which, in my opinion, is the best Whey you can buy and I NEVER buy a protein that has Whey Concentrate, you might as well drink milk. I have definitely seen great, lean results from this and have been constantly buying for almost over a year now. As for taste, I leave it for last because unlike most losers that buy supplements, I do not base what I buy off of taste, I buy it off of results. But anyway, the taste is fine. I mix it with water and drink it in 10 seconds. If you want to be a diva, mix it with milk and I bet it will taste even better. \n",
      "My favourite protein on the market. I like to go for a fast and slow acting protein mix. GRENADE serves us a transparent protein product containg high quality fast acting whey isolate and slow acting micellar casein. The two best protein sources of their kind. I can only recommend Hydra 6 in content, taste and texture. My number1.\n",
      "Best Protein Mix much better then jim that is to expensiv and more on the market . A perfect mix of whey and casein protein .\n",
      "This protein tastes great and mixes extremely well. I've used carnivore beef protein, muscletech beef protein, ON Whey, ON Casein, etc, and this one tastes the best. It has no bad lingering after taste at all. You can easily mix 2 scoops in just 8 ounces of milk or water and it doesnt clump nor is it super thick. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Tastes great and mixes very well.\n",
      "This is hands down the greatest tasting protein ive ever tried. The mix of casein vs whey is perfect for long shifts at work, before bed, or basically anytime. This mixes so good with skim milk its a crime. But after a workout when you need some simple carbs, mixed with juice this is straight up phenomenal. Im so glad i gave this a chance. There are many good whey proteins, but the usually taste like Gandhi's flip flop. I bought the stack justb l to get the Thermo Detonator fat burners. Best choice ever. Kudos!\n",
      "Very very sweet. Protein is not bad just have a glass of water near by to wash out your mouth of the sugary flavor left behind. I like the idea of a 50/50 blend. This protein mixes well and does not clump. The sugars in here do not seem very healthy.  The taste is ok if it was about half as sweet. Mixing with more water does not seem to dilute the sweetness much.\n",
      "I actually really liked this as a pre-bedtime shake. The flavor is as good as protein shakes can get, it mixes easily, and it doesn't make your guts turn over the next day. If there's a downside, it's that you wake up thirsty as hell in the night or the next morning, but that's an easy problem to fix.\n",
      "The results were great. I noticed a distinct improvement in recovery time. I think this was definitely something that was missing from my diet beforehand (I wasn't taking anything before bed), because there was a noticeable difference in how fast I was gaining lean muscle. \n",
      "Overall, I'd say this is the most useful purchase I've made on this site.\n",
      "Tastes good but mixes poorly. Clumps up on the sides of the blender. Also too thin for a Casein protein (my opinion)\n",
      "Bought the Strawberry Siege. Love mix it with a little greek yogurt for an evening snack,\n",
      "when i say it taste really good, that's because it is. even with just water\n",
      "Great tasting. Effective. Quality ingredients. Need I say more? Get it if you're looking to feed your body protein throughout the day or after a late workout and don't want to take casein before bed.\n",
      "This is by far the BEST PROTEIN I have used. With its 50 iso and 50 casein formula it is really effective. Could see the results within 1 week of usage. The only issue is that the taste is NOT THAT GREAT (but satisfactory). I find cellucor cookies and cream the best ever. MIXABILITY is good. I would recommend everyone to give it a try. It will become a Must have your supplements.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great product. The ingridient is suitable for meal replacement because it is a 50/50 of protein isolate and micellar casein, it was great for post workout because the isolate will digest right away and the casein will slowly release. about the taste, is fine taste, regular chocolate taste, but it got chocolate pieces, overall is worth a shot for it's ingridient.\n",
      "Strawberry is amazing, for real\n",
      "Best tasting protein I've ever tried. Will definitely buy again. Tastes good just with water. It tastes just like a oreo milkshake. \n",
      "I tried this protein once then I changed it just to try another brand but I ended up returning to Hydra 6 mainly because the results were better with this one than with the other brand. I think that Hydra 6 really works on building muscle and its amazing taste makes drinking a protein shake a very pleasant proceeding.\n",
      "I really dont understand people who rate protein powders by their taste. You are NOT buying supplements for their taste!!! If you want nice tasting shake, make yourself a milkshake! I just got my Grenade HYDRA 6 and I have to say after all the comments that I read about the Strawberry Siege flavour (how amazing it is), well its definitely far from the best. I will write another feedback few weeks from now, when I see how the product actually affects my performance.\n",
      "Great taste !\n",
      "Switched to this protein recently after getting tired of buying my regular whey and casein proteins separate (Cellucor's and Optimum Nutrition's respectively), and very pleased to say I'm positive I won't be going back! The flavor is incredible, easily the best protein powders I've ever tasted.  Chocolate Charge even has little crunchy brownie like bits in it which gives your shakes a little bit of texture which is never a bad thing.  Mixes perfectly in almond milk with a blender bottle, though it will clump slightly when mixed with water. Best part is I've found that casein powders tend to cause quite a bit of abdominal bloat for me, absolutely no problems with Hydra 6 though! Macro nutrient profile is also spot on, and the ingredient list is considerably tame too.  This stuff is always on sale too! A+ goes to Grenade!\n",
      "I am really writing this review because of the flavour of the strawberry seige.  It is REALLY good.  I can mix it with some veggie greens and it still tastes pretty good.  Depending on how much water or milk you mix with it, it can taste like strawberry quick.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the results, I couldn't say.  The profile is really good.  And i haven't lost any mass all while im adding additional cardio to cut body fat. So it must be doing its job as a whey/casein mix and minimizing muscle breakdown\n",
      "This is my first review and its because this whey deserves it. Im not some big body builder but i do go to the gym alot. This whey mixes so well and the taste is what sets it over the top. I have tried many protein flavors and nothing comes close to this flavor mixed with water or milk. My lifts have gotten better and my weight has increased with over a month of using\n",
      "I'm very fortunate that bodybuilding.com gave me a free sample of grenade protein. Out of many brand name protein, ON, Musclepharm, etc this is literally the best protein I have came across to. The 3 flavors I have tasted all taste very good and does its job as a protein supplement. I don't think I will ever switch to a different protein supplement. \n",
      "This is the best tasting protein I've ever had. BPI Sports ISO HD is a close second. \n",
      "\n",
      "But this blend of Casein and Isolate is really the best of both worlds. Highly recommend! I can really see a difference in my physique (and it's only been 3 days). Taking this right before bed (maybe coincidentally) and good amount of sleep has really made me see differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give it a try, you will not be sorry.\n",
      "Wow, I love this product. I've been taking a serving before bed and I am seeing awesome results. It also helps me recover faster. The taste is great.  \n",
      "Great value, tastes great. The only strawberry protein powder I've had that didn't taste chalky. Goes great when blended with strawberries, bananas, etc.\n",
      "Best tasting protein ever..tried all flavours, excellent for making cocktail shakes and best profile.will stick to it for a long time\n",
      "Tastes very good. Has an awesome profile too :-)\n",
      "I like to use this protein as a quick snack on the run or before bed. It's a mix of casein and whey isolate. I've only had the strawberry and it's ok. It has tiny pieces of what I guess are strawberries that don't mix up. This is how it is supposed to be. I think chalky is too harsh of a term to describe, but it has a texture. \n",
      "Anyway this stuff is always on sale and is worth a try. Next time I'll go with a different flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein definitely tastes great and mixes well. I have mixed it with water, and milk, and it's always very smooth. I really like the fact that it is 50 percent whey and 50 percent Casein.\n",
      "Strawberry Siege is great! Not to sweet but has great taste.\n",
      "Cookie Chaos is a little too sweet for me on its own.\n",
      "I received a sample of grenade hydra 6 chocolate charge a few YEARS ago and haven't gone back to my old favorite (BSN syntha 6). I love the taste. Seems to help curb appetite too.  Kill vanilla is a little too sweet for me on its own but a great base for making a pb2 shake or mixed with Greek yogurt.  My only real complaint is the packaging. The product comes in a bag with a zip lock seal.  However, the stupid zip lock sometimes crashes undone or rips off from the bag itself. Would love to see a new package from this company. \n",
      "First of all Thank you Grenade for making an AWESOME protein  powder. Hydra 6 comes in a bag, and honestly  I think i like the bag better then the bottle. Stores easier, takes up less space, easier to transport, and still stays nice  and  fresh.  But enough with the gibberish hah. So the flavor i tried was Cookie Chaos, and Its taste was very pleasing. If you are a person that doesn't drink milk and has to do water with your protein, then I would recommend this flavor. very rich and potent!!! I would recommend using a blender bottle with it instead of a smart shake because the cookie pieces are just large enough they get stuck in the smart shake filter and take more time to clean out. But its SOOO WORTH  IT CUZ THE COOKIE PIECES DEF MAKE THE TASTE  STAND OUT !!!............................................................\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a Separate review for Strawberry Siege flavor!  It is LITERALLY THE BEST Strawberry Flavor protein I have had yet!!! Most strawberry proteins taste like the strawberry syrup fake flavor, but this taste like as close to fresh strawberries as I think possible. It helps that Grenade puts dehydrated strawberry bits in the powder, really adds taste and texture!  If you are a Strawberry protein flavor fan?? Then def try it out! Makes and mixes great in shakes =)\n",

      "The Killa Vanilla is def one of The BEST vanillas I have had. My fav is to add it to my banana smoothies. The strawberry is good too, just like i said above. But the vanilla just adds that extra hint of creamy goodness that tastes soon good with a banana, a lil milk and ice cubes!!!\n",
      "By far the best protein in terms of tastes, ability to mix, and ease of use. I just buy this instead of buying separate whey isolates and casein. \n",
      "Im not much for words but this stuff is legit. tastes great, mixes wholly. This is definitely worth it. Would recommend to a friend. \n",
      "I generally take ON gold standard casein but didn't like any of the flavors. I feel that you should look forward to taking your protein shake. Grenade Hydra 6 50/50 is a great blend, helps with recovery, and tastes great! I mix one scoop with 12oz milk before I go to bed and I can feel the benefits the next day! I only wish it had bcaas in it though. \n",
      "Normally I buy whey and casein separate and take them individually and together whenever I please. During the football season I don't have a lot of time and money to spend on multiple proteins, so I bought this 50/50 blend of whey and casein. It has the purest ingredient lable out of all the blends by far, and does not contain any concentrates. The taste is better than any other protein I have used. The only down side is that it contains corn syrup solids, acesulsemfame potassium, and artificial flavor. Overall, it is great protein at an affordable price.\n",
      "One of the best tasting protein shakes.\n",
      "This protein tastes great and mixes well. I have mixed it with water, and milk, and it's always very smooth. This is probably one advantage I have noticed about the blends. Caesin alone mixes THICK, but the blends seem to make it manageable. The only complaint i have is it is slightly gritty/chalky, and that's just me being critical. NBD still a great product!\n",
      "Love this product.  taste better than straight casein protein as well as texture.  Mix with different frozen fruits to give different flavors.  will be ordering again.  \n",
      "This product is fantastic for all your protein needs. I was reading Stoppani's website and he was emphasizing the need for a protein blend in order to maximize results, he descibes it as 50%casein 40%whey and the rest bcaa rich proteins like egg.Nearly exactly hydra's specs! Before this I had bought Muscle Pharm Combat Powder regularly but when it was time to re-up I decided to give this try. The Strawberry is great! Reminds me of a glass of strawberry milk with alot of milk in it. Not to sweet but has great taste, texture is smooth and enjoyable. When it comes to the label its superb, The pure isolate is the ideal postworkout or preworkout protein where as the casein makes sure to fuel you through your workout of recover post. Great stuff!\n",
      "Tasted like the creme filling of an Oreo cookie! Great price too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flavor is absolutely phenomenal. It mixes well and easily with water. Would recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very good tasting protein powder and I really like the fact that it is 50 percent whey and 50 percent Casein. It does have little pieces of chocolate in it if that bothers you. It is usually on sale quit a bit which also improves this product. \n",
      "Best over flavor of any protein I've experienced. I mix scoop of this with just water after my workout and it tastes fantastic. Uniquely balanced 50/50 Protein + Micellar Casen blend is extremely versatile and slow absorbing feed muscles throughout the day. \n",
      "This is my favorite protein period. Profile, taste, texture, and little cookie chunks are all on point.\n",
      "Can be totally honest, is amazing, its like the best bday cake, vanilla, and oreo cream filling. Usually chocolate is my thing but this is a great rival. Mixes smooth stays mixed and had no stomach issues afterwards. Will be trying the others soon. CHOCOLATE CHARGE another GREAT from GRENADE!!\n",
      "Was pretty good! Love that it came in a bag for easy store! It taste okay will just water but if you mix it with almond milk it taste just like a strawberry shake! I use it at night before bed to get some fast acting protein right after work and some slow protein for when I sleep! Great for the price. My only Issue is that I wish the scoop handle was bigger!\n",
      "\n",
      "This protein was definitely not my favorite but I felt as though it was extremely beneficial to my recovery time. The biggest draw back was the chocolate bits they put into the powder, it makes it hard to fully mix in a shaker so I would use the blender to make it completely smooth. Other than that it was a great product and I would recommend it if you don't mind the chunks!\n",
      "Maybe I was biased because I had BSN's Syntha-6 cookies and cream at the same time as this but the flavor just didn't do it for me. Additionally, the Hydra didn't mix as well as i would have liked, and now that I've tried other whey proteins and casein, I'm guessing it is due to the casein content of the Hydra. It is a good product, but I find i would rather have the two proteins individually than as a mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the zipper broke on my bag well before I was out of the product. It is very aggravating to zip close and pry open a zipper like that with your fingers. Even still, the protein stayed fresh.\n",
      "Unfortunately Hydra-6 not my best experience with proteins yet. After taking it I felt stomach discomfort and heaviness.\n",
      "Taste and consistency wasn't as expected also. Very watery consistency, doesn't feels like 50% casein (which is thick usually). Taste is more artificial sweetness than actual cookies.\n",
      "I have tried others which were good, but this is best, mixes great with milk, taste is very good and I like being able to take before or after workout. I have made marked improvements since taking. Will buy again.\n",
      "Love this protein! The taste is great and the texture is perfect, not to thick, not to watery. I highly recommend this protein and for anyone looking for a protein blend to give it a try, I bet You'll be hooked ;) it's like I'm cheating when I'm dieting not only great in shakes, but when mixed in with Greek yogurt  AMAZING  \n",
      "Brought this as PRO JYM is currently sold out \n",
      "I have tried most makes going and none have impressed me so thought I'd try this new hydra 6 \n",
      "The combination of whey and casein is brilliant \n",
      "It mixes really well in a shaker bottle with water & milk \n",
      "I purchased the chocolate charge and it is the WORST chocolate flavour I have ever tasted in a protien product even with minimal water it is so weak and leaves a horrible after taste \n",
      "I'm not normally one to moan about taste as I just down it and job done but thought I had to about this \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a average product as I dread when it's time for a protein shake due to the taste\n",
      "Definitely recommend this product.  For one it's a protein blend that has limited ingredients.  Appears to have no amino spiking either which is good.  It's delicious and you can take it any time of day.  I like that they include chunks of chocolate in the chocolate flavor.  The cookie flavor is great too.  If you're looking for a whey and casein combined powder this is the one for you.\n",
      "The results are amazing and best part is the taste. Have purchased 1 before to try and just bought another two as it is the best I have had yet. Only 1 downside is the zipper to seal the packet keeps falling off and is of not good quality , hope they fix this. \n",
      "I'm going on my sixth 4lb.bag of of this stuff.  It's awesome to say the least!  Both chocolate and vanilla taste excellent, and the 50/50 mix of fast and slow release protein has helped me build substancial muscle mass when added to my Creatine and BCAA stack.  Great for pre, post, and bedtime.  I would drink the Chocolate even if it wasn't good for me, and the vanilla is great too, but doesn't mix as thick.  Try it, you'll like it!\n",
      "Tastes good and mixes well.  From what I've seen it's a good bang for your buck especially if you can get it at buy one get one 50% off!  The cookie chaos tastes more like a vanilla to me, but it is still really good.\n",
      "This is by far the best tasting protein that I have tried to date.  It tastes so good that you can lick the powder right off of your fingers. It mixes well and can be taken whenever, this makes for a good everyday protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is on of my favorite two proteins. I love the combination of casein protein and whey protein. This protein mixes okay, it has weird little chocolate chunks in it that don't mix at all. That is my only dislike of this protein and why i rated the flared at a 7, if it didn't have the little chunks, it would easily be a 10. If you're debating getting a 100% Casein protein or a blend, get this, you wont regret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hands down the BEST protein I've had. The taste is amazing. Most people comment on the \"chunks\" or that it doesn't mix well, but if you mix it with fruits in a blender, it's doubly amazing. I've been using this product ever since I found out about it and haven't switched to any other protein. \n",
      "I completely trust this product and company. \n",
      "A great product in my opinion. It tasted pretty good but only downside that I saw was that it did not really mix that well. Other than that it is a great product to use and I recommend it for anyone to try.\n",
      "I normally don't like vanilla. But this is really good. Great for mixing in other things like fruit and veggies. Mixes very well without leaving clumps of product in the glass. I have already re-ordered a few times and will continue to do so.\n",
      "This stuff works great! I would use it again. \n",
      "Really great product!\n",
      "I love this stuff, it tastes great and delivers a great combo ratio of the different proteins. Win Win for all.\n",
      "The powder mixes quickly and evenly which is great.  It sits light on the stomach, so much so that doing cardio immediately after downing a shake doesn't lead to any kind of discomfort. Flavor is also excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will be buying again.\n",
      "I have tried this protein and no doubt I love it. I recommend it 100%.\n",
      "This is by far the best tasting protein powder I have ever used.  I use one scoop of chocolate and one scoop of cookie for my post workout shake and the combination is delicious! It blends very well and very quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really am enjoying the Grenade products that I have recently purchased!  I have a hard time sticking with one protein (i'm trying to go from a casual user to a more committed one since my lifting workouts have increased so much). I have 2-3 other flavors and brands at my house that i have burnt out on in only 1-2 weeks.  I work in the food flavoring industry - so I am super picky/fussy about how things taste.. I chose the Killa Vanilla since I was looking for a good vanilla base for shakes, smoothies, etc.  I have been so impressed with the flavor that I drink it without any thing else mixed in.  There is a slight chalkiness upfront if mixed with water, but that is masked in skim milk.  The vanilla flavoring is slightly fruity, birthday cake icing.  Highly recommend!\n",
      "Update: I have now tried Cookie Chaos - it is also a really tasty product!  Has a similar base as the Killa Vanilla but also includes a chocolate cookie note and some cookie pieces. \n",
      "\n",
      "This protein mixes well with water. I also use it in my oatmeal and pancake batter and its awesome in both. Definitely on my list of protein powdets especially with the whey and casein blend which is great for recovery after a workout.\n",
      "Hands down the BEST protein shake!  I look forward to drinking this!  I would also say mixes the best compared to the competition.  I never write reviews, but I was just blown away by the flavor.  \n",
      "great flavor right off the bat. cookie chaos is a little gritty at the end but NOT chunky, not sure it its the casein or what but its not that bad. I am super picky when it comes to protein flavors and consistency, Hydra 6 and ON's gold standard are in my top 3 when it comes to flavor and consistency. not too thick not too thin (i mix with milk not water). beyond flavor i love the 50-50 mix so i can take it right after a workout and double dose if i cant get a proper meal right after, and great at night before bed. keeps away the middle of the night empty stomach feeling that kills your eating schedule.  this will stay on my rebuy list for  sure!\n",
      "Wow. Grenade Hydra 6 really nailed the Cookie Chaos flavor.  It's the first \"CnC\" that really tastes like Oreo's and milk to me.  I've had to choke down some others before I finally found this one - and will stick with it until I start craving chocolate again.  The 50/50 protein mix is great, as I can take it  throughout the day without worrying about using different types at specific times.  Easy and tasty!!  Highly recommend.\n",
      "The best flavored protein I ever had. It is so delicious that you could have it all day. Love it and will keep having it.\n",
      "Love this as it can be taken as a post-workout and before sleep. The taste is the best compared to other brands I had. \n",
      "Got this as my casein protein for pre-sleep and the taste, consistency, and quality are all top notch.  This isn't one of those 'choke it down' protein powders and I'm thankful for that.  I typically would mix this with almond milk and it tasted just like a milkshake.  Excellent taste and no clumping.  \n",
      "Bit on the too sweet side for my taste and the chocolate chunks dont fit through the strainer on a smart shaker so always left in the cup. Does go down easy and other then the chunky pieces it does mix well.\n",
      "I've received a sample of this in Cookie Chaos and purchased Killa Vanilla after. I love both. They make great shakes and cook well in mug cakes, pancakes and waffles. I love getting my whey and casein together so this was perfect for me! I'll definitely be back for more!\n",
      "\n",
      "Good product and cookie chaos very good!\n",
      "I have tried just about every protein under the sun, some of my regulars where phase 8 and combat powder. Loved them both! However, ever since trying hydra 6 for the first time about 8 months ago I haven't used another protein again. Recommend it for every single fitness goal out there. 50-50 blend you can use it anytime of the day, use mine as my pre-bed meal. If you want it as a light protein take it with water, if you want it as a weight gainer blend it with a banana some oats, spinach, fats, and some yogurt that way you avoid all the fluff and garbage they pump into weight gainers. Regardless, my only reason for not giving it a perfect 10 is because the only perfect protein would ideally be from whole foods,\"In my opinion\". Enjoy it! \n",
      "I was so happy when I received my own bag of Hydra 6, I've been using for a few days now after my early afternoon workouts and I love it so far.  It tastes so delicious and that's with water alone. I also love the fact that's it's both whey isolate and casein in one serving. It feds me right away then slowly feeds me until my next meal which is usually a hour after ( i usually feel hungry 20 min after my regular protein shake). I see no need to buy whey and casein, so that means more savings. You can't go wrong.\n",
      "This is the cleanest, best tasting form of protein I have found so far. I love how they don't use BCAAs as a filler for added processed protein/casein. This is pure whey protein isolate and pure micellar casein. Plus, as it states on the bag, the taste really is unprecedented. I actually take one scoop as a preworkout, then two scoops for my post workout and I feel great during and after every workout. Highly recommend!\n",
      "I have never done review before, but as I love this product I thought I should do one. Taste I have tried all the flavours and they are amazing. I use a shaker with water and it mixes really well. I have noticed significant gains since I started taking this product, I take 1 servings 3 times a day, first this in the morning, post workout, and before bed. I recommend you try this product, you won’t regret it.\n",
      "Best tasting Strawberry I can remember trying and maybe my favorite ever along with Xtreme Formulations UP2.0 stuff. Little higher in carbs than most I use but that's fine. Using an awesome mix of whey isolate and micellar casein this is top quality stuff and I recommend trying it!\n",
      "Literally the best strawberry flavored protein I have ever had!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It tastes amazing, especially the strawberry pieces inside it. i enjoy every sip i take. Thanks for bodybuilding for letting me try it for free. i ordered another one \n",
      "Never heard of this but I tried it because it was on sale. I think this will be my \"go to\" protein from now on. Best tasting strawberry, hands down and this mixes real well with water or milk in a shaker. Love it.\n",
      "I have really noticed a difference with this protein powder.  I feel like I am making bigger strength gains, recovery times are shorter, and I feel fuller longer.  The taste is great too.  Vanilla does have a bit of a chalky texture but still tastes good.  I would highly recommend this product!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great taste and keeps me full.  I used this as my casien before bed and don't wake up hungry like I have with others.\n",
      "I was excited about this product and I'm sure it works, but the taste was terrible! Even worse... It had small little pieces of cookie (I assume) that resembled rat feces, that would float to the top before you drank it. Those pieces made me gag as I drank it. I ended up giving away over half the bag, as I could not choke it down! \n",
      "So far, so good...especially on the flavor.  Note to self: secure another bag (maybe Cookie Chaos) for storage at work.\n",
      "I've used Trutein & Isobolic before which is a blend of proteins as well, so I wanted to give Hydra 6 a try as well. This is probably not one of the worse tasting proteins I've tried, but definitely in the top 5. I cannot speak about the other products, but the Strawberry Seige is disgusting. It does not mix well, there are tiny strawberry pieces that does not taste anything like strawberries. There's chalky flavor in your mouth at least until you drink water or something. I'm very disappointed. I wanted to return it and get Trutein or Isobolic which I always do, but I did not want to go through the hassle. I'm usually open to trying new proteins, but after the strawberry siege, i think i'm just going to stay away from Hydra 6. \n",
      "I would give this a 20/10 :) Awesome protein blend. Amazing flavor! This is my third bag (have tried cookies and cream as well) and I am very happy with the results. The 50/50 whey/casein blend is perfect with my oatmeal for breakfast in the AM or as a snack  in the afternoon. I have a sensitive stomach and I have not had any issues with this product. Dissolves super easily and tastes rich and amazing. No after taste as well! Highly recommend!\n",
      "great protein will deff buy again.. taste good and I like the mix of protein.. this is my new go to powder\n",
      "This is definitely the best tasting protein I've ever had. Chocolate Charge had bits of cookie-like pieces that don't dissolve (loved them). Mixability was probably the best I've seen in a Whey-Casein blend. For containing 50% Casein, the consistently was great . . . not thick like most Casein shakes I've had. As for lean muscle contribution, I can't say much as I've only had the powder for about a week. \n",
      "Finally a blend that is perfect, wish is had less carbs though.and a digestive enzyme is always a plus. But I have big expectations for this stuff.\n",
      " \n",
      "Just got my Hydra 6im the mail today.  At $36 for a 4lb bag, I couoldn't pass the deal up.  Let me tell you, I'm so glad I jumped on the deal.  This Hydra 6 strawberry is amazeballs.  Taste is 10/10.  Tastes like strawberry quick.  Love the pieces of strawberries inside.  I made a smoothie with one scoop, banana, mango, milk, honey, and ice.  Stuff tasted like an indulgent strawberry milkshake.  Unbelievable.  My daughter was asking for seconds.  Tried a scoop with water.  I can see why a lot of reviews say its gritty.  However, I don't mind at all and other than that, it mixed rather well.  So I'll give mixability a 9/10.  The smoothie kept me full and content for a while, maybe like 3 hours or so.  I would definitely buy this product again, especially if it's 25% off, no question about it.\n",
      "I have been using Hydra6 for about a month now and it is by far one of the best proteins I have used.  I'm not a huge gym rat but I have found this product to be worth the money.  Best tasting protein.  \n",
      "This is the best tasting protein I've ever had.  (Well, other than a steak of course)\n",

      "Seriously.\n",

      "You really can't beat the value, taste or performance of this 50/50 protein.\n",
      "Didn't really live up to the hype taste wise. Good macro/protein profile though. Cookie Chaos was pretty good with milk but close to undrinkable with water. For the price I was expecting a bit better\n",
      "Flavor standpoint Musclepharm Cookies n Cream is way better....BUT overall standpoint this is way better in the nutrition and price standpoint.....The flavor is good enough to keep me away from Musclepharm\n",
      "I bought the Cookie chaos flavor. This is the best tasting Protien i have ever tried. does not have the classic chalk taste.\n",
      "I have found this to be the best protein powder that I have tried. I would definitely recommend it! First of all, the 50:50 blend of casein:whey is great. The taste is fantastic as well! It mixes well with milk, tastes great (even has small pieces of cookie in it), and is pretty filling. I used to stick with cheap protein like Body Fortress, but after having this , I am definitely hooked. Worth the money (it's a good price anyways). I have been making very steady strength improvements while I've been taking this as well, more obvious than before (but that could be due to numerous things). Anyways, I would definitely recommend this for anyone! Even my girlfriend who despises whey protein loves this stuff ! \n",
      "Not impressed with this product at all. Taste is not good at all. waste of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was expecting a much better product from company like Grenade.\n",
      "I bought the Strawberry Siege. It tastes great and mixes well with either water or milk.  I also like that it is 50/50, whey/casein.  I've used this protein all times of the day, pre/post workout and before bed depending on my day. Love the little strawberry pieces as well.  Would definitely buy again. \n",

They have little cookie bits in both that just add to the pleasure of downing the shake. Overall, a great product that I'll be buying again!\n",

Taste well I've had better, but the texture and mix is top notch. Not to watery and not thick.its not sweet either. Gains well I don't no till been a few weeks. But so far so good. \n",

The only bad part is that when i mix it with milk, it made me really gassy.I would love to try other brands but I think Grenade got me hooked. Will be trying out the 4lb. Strawberry Siege because it's their highest rating one for the flavouring. 10/10 would recommend. Give it a try. \n",

      "Have been on Hydra 6 now for 2 weeks so far and truly impressed with it. I use this as my post workout protein shake and before bed if I feel I need it or didn't get my proper amount of protein in for the day. A great combo of whey and casein that I'm glad finally came around so I can stop mixing myself since it's already done for me. The bag design is cool and I personally do enjoy the bag more because it's easier to carry around or store in my cabinet. I will defiantly be ordering more of this Hydra 6 and try out the other flavors. Mixability is great and taste is as good as it gets. Mixed with water it taste good but with milk or almond milk is where the real flavor is at. Just my honest opinion on that but you will be satisfied.\n",
      "Finally a 50/50 product, been mixing casein with isolates myself for a while and gotten great results, now I have a 2-in-1 product! Taste: 10/10 for Cookie Chaos! If you've ever tried Phase 8's Cookies & Cream, this tastes exactly the same! The blend of Isolate and Casein protein make this product thicker than your average shake, but not as thick as a casein with milk added.

So far this has done very well by me and I'm working on my second box as of this posting. For better or for worse this product does not contain any joint supplement ingredients nor does the company have a product for joint maintenance at the time of this post. That is not a detracting point and my 9 rating is only meant to say that this is as close to perfect as a product can get. \n",

I then got a refund and bought the large and they fit great, but as my arms grow to be 16 they won't fit. These are great for someone who isn't that big yet, but for veterans, these aren't for you.\n",

The Triple Berry Caffeine is my favorite supplement when I need a nutritional supplement with a kick to help me when I'm doing 11+ mile runs. I've tried various energy supplements during my runs to help me but the GU Triple Berry is my favorite. It give me the carbs, electrolytes, caffeine and amino acids in a convenient little package that are easy to carry and a little caffeine to keep me going. \n",

      "GU works very well.  They are small and convenient to carry along for that long day.  I normally use one full one after a hard day at the gym.  My wife is a marathon runner and into Crossfit.  She uses these things religiously.  She swears by the sustained energy and quick recovery.  I think the key when using this supp is to stay hydrated.  I personally don't think the flavors were too bad.  I enjoyed the ones I tried (we buy the flavor mix).  The product is a bit thick but is squeezes easy from the tube and goes down just fine.  Usually a drink or two of water immediately right after is sufficient to \"rinse\" down whatever is left.  I'm sensitive to caffeine and the regular caffeine ones are ok for me.  I have yet to try the (X2). My wife claims there isn't much of a difference.  She does, however, say she can feel a difference from the ones without caffeine.  She says they don't give her the boost of energy that the caffeine ones do. Overall a Good Product.\n",

I also take these right before the start of a race.\n",

The problem is that it doesn't taste like a fresh, delicious donut from a great bakery. It tastes like an old Krispy Kreme chocolate donut that got triple glazed somehow. I have a monster of a sweet tooth and this was WAAAAY too sweet for me, so I sent it back :(\n",

A lot of protein dont supply 45 grams per 1.5 scoops which is also nice when trying to add extra protein in your diet especially directly after work outs. The aminos that this protein supplies also is perfect for recovery after a hard lift. I have been using this protein for quite some time now and it digest very well. Heavenly chocolate is the best flavor and i put vanilla as only a 7-8 because of personal preference but way better then the majority of the vanilla proteins i have tasted.\n",

      "This product is awesome. I don't know why the rating for the vanilla flavor is so low.  This protein tastes just as good, if not better, than any other ARTIFICIAL vanilla protein and this one is NATURAL!

With the exception of the Syntha6 the others were either too sweet or caused me to bloat. I found this Product from Healthy 'N Fit t be the happy medium.. a good profile, better than decent taste and good value. Mixes well too with a shaker. I like the Chocolate with Skim Milk, taste like Ovaltine. Since using this for the past several months I have been on a cutting cycle, losing weight while adding muscle and I am happy with my gains. I will be sticking with this one for a while. Try their GH Enhancer too. Also a very good product. I highly reccomend that stack cycled with a good thermogenic/fat burner.\n",
      "I just ordered another five pounds if that tells ya something ! 45 grams of protein,NO Acesulfume,Sucralose,Sunflower oil creamer, or Guar Gums and all the aminos you'll need in just one heaping scoop. Too bad the price went up seven bucks, and it's not even on the popular top 50 list !!\n",

I take it (Heavenly Choc.) every morning for breakfast by blending 8oz. of skim milk, one banana, 1 cup of oats, 1 cup of fruit (peaches, strawberries, etc...), 1 tbl spoon of peanut butter and a little ice.  It makes for a WONDERFUL &amp;amp; FILLING breakfast.  I also take it after every workout (within 20min) with water.  The powerder mixes very well with water and tastes GREAT!  It can be used as a meal replacement or a meal supplement.  You WILL NOT find a better product at a better price!\n",

Combined with my favorite power lifting/mass building routine, the 5 x 5, I routinely put on 12-20 Lbs of muscle within 6-12 weeks. I was disappointed when I couldn't find it in the stores anymore, but excited that BodyBuilding.com sells at a more affordable price. If you are trying to put on some serious muscle in a short period of time, this is the way!\n",
      "No BS! This stuff really works. I don't know if it's because the dosages are right on, the quality of the product itself or what? I have tried other similar products with no results but this one helped my muscle gains while dieting down. Also helped me achieve nice pumps similar to Creatine w/o all the hassle. I take it on an empty stomach right before bed. I recommend it.\n",

It's not worth the pressure headaches and inability to stay focused at work. \n",
      "The new version 3 taste a lot better than previous versions. it's also more smooth and creamy, even with water. This is probably because they now use micronized creatine versus the old stuff.\n",

You can ACTUALLY FEEL the difference it does to your body. it will break down protein more efficiently and it detoxes all as well. strange but true i stop getting protein *****. :D   biggggg PLUS.

Could have given more of a pump as I feel that is where it was lacking for me. Blue Raspberry flavor wasn’t bad at all and product mixed just fine for me in a shaker cup with minimal effort as well as in a cup with a spoon would like to know what the green apple taste like though. Content with this product and am currently alternating it with other pre workouts I have open.\n",

I don't know of a better tasting pre-workout than the green apple flavor and that is despite the fact that this pre- is packed full of great energy and pump-inducing ingredients.  It would be 10/10 if they added some creatine hcl, beta alanine, glycerol, and peak-atp.  The peak-atp in their other pre-workout, Peak Perform, is great stuff.\n",
      "Hit Built is an amazing pre-workout. It's energy and focus is great and there isn't a crash at the end. I normally hit the gym after work and there are very few preworkouts that can do the job for me but this one was great! I definitely recommend trying it out!\n",

It did make me a bit nauseous before my tolerance was built, so I would start with maybe 3/4 of a serving to gauge it.\n",

I made the mistake of only mixing in about 4-8 oz of water one time and was literally so shaky for about an hour after that I couldn't complete my workout. When mixed with the PROPER amount of water though I think this is a reasonable pre workout. I do wish it had a little more focus though. After a while I feel my focus waning.\n",

My digestive system is super sensitive and this product, without any of the fake sugars, chocolate or Apple (severe triggers) is the only one I have found that I can handle. I appreciate them making this product! I literally live off of the protein bars made from this powder.\n",

      "Seems to be a great quality protein. The pumpkin spice was a good flavor and definitely mixed well... i used it in my oatmeal and it was great. The waffles and syrup flavor was awful though; it just tastes way too artificial. Overall, would buy again... Would love to try the other two flavors, as they are definitely unique.\n",
      "It does not mix well at all, be prepared to use a blender. A little inconvenient. Taste isn't too bad, but if your tongue is sensitive you can tell there were lots of chemical processes to make this product. Smells like heaven, but that doesn't make the taste better nor does it make it mix better.\n",
      "Good product. Enjoyed a different flavor to mix things up a bit. I will use this again in the future. \n",
      "This is a really high quality product, and I'm surprised it isn't more popular. The big selling point for me is that it's made with whey from grass-fed/hormone free dairy. For the price - that's unheard of. \n",

      "I love pumpkin flavored anything, so I had to try this.  I was a little iffy at first, but it's got an amazing flavor, and mixes pretty well.  It tastes almost like a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks, minus the coffee ... sweet, but a little spice to it.  I'll be mixing this in all kinds of protein shakes.  Glad I tried this one!\n",
      "Very tasty protein, actually, one of my favorites. It mixes well with milk or almond milk, and it makes a great base for any fruit or power smoothie!\n",
      "I bought the pumpkin spice because I LOVE anything pumpkin flavored...let's just say its AMAZING. I can't have any food with artificial sweeteners so I was very happy to find this! I haven't tried it with water or milk yet, but with plain yogurt or in a mug cake it's absolutely fantastic. Recommend to everyone!!! \n",
      "Just got this over the weekend.  Tastes awesome with skim milk, pretty good with water.  Looks like it has a good breakdown.   Looking forward to trying the other flavors.\n",
      "Loved this flavor so unique and actually tasted like pound cake.  If you want whey this is the whey to go!  Scoops a bit bigger but oh well.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite whey protein powders. It's great clean protein with amazing taste! \n",
      "\n",
      "Mostly bought this because it had great taste reviews. The other flavors didn't sound very appealing and I just ordered the white chocolate which had no reviews. So, first off, the texture and smell are great. Mixes instantly and no clumps at all. Taste I gave it a nine because it tastes ****ght, but the thing is it has no like bitter after taste like most proteins do, which is great. Another thing; I only tried it with water, I assume it tasting much better with some skim milk. I still recommend this product.\n",
      "this is a must! tried several different brands, this is the one I am sticking with! Easy to mix and not chalky, and best flavors by far!!!! Thank you HIT :) \n",
      "The profile is good, I love carrot cake and was completely dissapointed by this product the reviews made me think it would taste awesome but I think it tastes like crap and friends I have let try it agree, would not recommend.\n",
      "Bought it because of people said it tasted amazing, and it does!  Macros aren't bad either!\n",
      "I don't normally take the time to do a review, but this\n",

      "This product is amazing.  The taste is excellent and the quality exceeds my expectations. Very big supporter of HIT Products!\n",
      "By far one of the best tasting proteins out there right now! \n",
      "\n",
      "Love HIT supplements. Haven't gone wrong, I've taken different pre-workouts and tried their raspberry ketone as well as this fat burner. I'm finding the pills a little large and hard to swallow but another great product from an awesome company! \n",
      "\n",
      "honestly I never really noticed a difference....\n",
      "While using this I lost 7lbs while weight lifting and maintaining a high protein diet. It didn't give me the jitters, it just gave me enough energy to make it through the day. The onky thing about it that I was disappointed in was that I guess I became tolerant to it. It didn't affect me towards the end like in the beginning but it was worth the 7lbs!\n",
      "This product is great!  It doesn't make me shaky at all and I am very sensitive to \"energy\" products.  \n",
      "It does seem to suppress appetite, and also just makes me feel good!\n",
      "\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Curves my appetite well but it lacks at giving me energy! Won't buy again\n",
      "Its been about a month and I feel it hasn't done anything for me. It doesn't suppress my appetite or hasnt helped me loose anything and Ive been working out and eating right so I feel it just hasnt worked for me and my body. Im kinda bummed about it:(\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great appetite suppressor. Seriously, I never felt hungry, which could be a good thing in certain situations, but it wasn't really for me. I didn't see any fat loss the whole time, but I did get energy, and like said never felt hungry. I took this with caffeine and felt fine. I wish I had better results of it being a \"fat burner\". \n",
      "I  was pretty let down by this product. It did't give me the energy I want from a pre-workout, I found myself feeling sluggish more than usual after a workout with no pre-workout. Also my first experience with taking biotin and made me break out. The taste was pretty good though. \n",
      "Taste of product was fine -- not what I expected, but didn't seem offensively artificial to me. But I got little benefit energy-wise from this product. I have to take at least two scoops to feel anything, and I take a fat-burner with it. I'm a bit disappointed, but I'll use it until it's gone if I work out later in the day and don't want to chance not sleeping with the other one I use...\n",
      "This is my go to pre workout, won't ever change it for any other brand, not only it tastes great but also is the only one that won't give me the jitters and still makes me feel like a beast!! i have tasted the sweet grapefruit and tangerine and they are pretty yummy but my favorite is definitely the pina colada one!\n",

Other than the surprisingly good taste this pre-work out has given me an on set of headaches and lose of energy not happy with this product. And when I say headaches I mean migraines all days long.   \n",
      "The taste is amazing! No bad after taste. However, I take two serving to get the desired pump I am looking for\n",
      "I love this product! I do feel like it gives me energy and the taste is great! It mixes well without a blender ball and it doesn't leave a nasty after-taste. Highly recommend this for any ages for a preworkout! :)\n",
      "This is the first pre-workout supplement that my husband let me take and I loved it! It tastes great, doesn't make you gittery, and I love that it gave me the boost and engergy to have a better and longer workout. Highly recommend this product!\n",
      "I wake up at 4am to get go to the gym. I swear by this stuff. I make it every morning and drink it while I'm getting ready. Once I am at the gym I am wide awake and prepared to workout like it's nobodies business. It tastes good and mixes well. I am on my 2nd tub now and I will continue to buy. Great product!!\n",
      "I bought the 7 servings Hit Igniter. I have been disappointed before by some caffeinated pre-workout making me nauseous. This one has just  enough caffeine to give me the pump I need without the unwanted side effects. It gives me the stamina, mental focus and energy I need on leg days, keeps me going longer and harder. I will buy again.\n",
      "This product gives me the drive I need at the end of the day too workout and taste great!! Best I've tried!!\n",
      "I love it and it doesn't give me the jitters.... it keeps me focused and energized thru my whole workout...\n",
      "Love this product, won't switch to another. Gives me the boost I need to complete my workout and the tropical punch flavor is amazing! \n",
      "The taste is very mild/bland, but not offensive. I liked the fact that I could buy a small amount to try it without spending a fortune.  It seems like a good product, but not as good as NLA for her Uplift, which nothing has beat for me so far. \n",
      "I've tried a few ignitors and finally found one that doesn't give me jitters, and no crashing. I did experience tingling in my face the first few days but it went away after that. Mixes well and taste is good too! Buying it again!\n",
      "This is the first pre-workout powder I have ever bought and so far it's great! I'm pumped to go work out, no jitters or crashes. The taste kind of reminded me of eating smarties which isn't a bad thing but tolerable and it does get the job done. \n",
      "The actual pre-workout part of this product works just fine.  The flavor is fine...at first.  I very much dislike burping this up during my workout! And the smell it leaves in my shaker after it is gone is unbearable.  It smells like a dirty moldy rag. :( I tried using it for a few days and couldn't do it anymore.  I gave the rest of the container to my friend and she said the same as me.  The pina colada flavor is not good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The product itself works pretty good. But it is so vitamin heavy, I have a hard time stomaching it. If mixed with some gatorade it does pretty well. But I am unable to get a good workout in when I nearly throw up the pre workout. \n",
      "This is a great pre-workout. I take 1 1/2-2 scoops because I have a relatively high tolerance for caffeine (after taking hydroxycut hardcore elite) and i'm ready to go! No crash and no jitters. Flavor is also amazing. Happy to find a product with BCAA's, beta-alanine and creatine monohydrate in one! Will definitely repurchase\n",
      "This preworkout is great! The pina colada flavor is the best tasting preworkout i've ever had and i've tried quite a few. It gave me awesome energy for my workout. Only problem I had was I took it after work at 6pm and could not fall asleep until about 9 hrs later. Taking some melatonin helped. But I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "Great pre-workout.  I workout in the evenings and this gives me the energy and focus to push through without keeping me awake all night.  The flavor is better than any other pre-workout I've taken and it mixes really well.\n",
      "Awesome pre-workout. Gives all the energy needed to fuel your workouts. \n",
      "Great pre-workout. The flavor is awesome, dissolves  really well. I feel the energy with just one scoop and it helps me push through my workout without feeling jittery. \n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I take two scoops with about 12-14 oz. of water. It takes about 20 min and I immediately can feel the difference. I can complete a workout and I still have energy to clean my house after....this stuff is amazing!!!\n",

      "Yes the pills are big but you get used to them pretty quickly\n",
      "I am someone who is quite picky about what I put in my body. This is the first multivitamin I've used in nearly 10 years. I absolutely love the nutrient makeup and ingredients in the HIT multi. As other users have commented - the pill is large, but what vitamins aren't? Certainly easy enough to take with a couple swigs of liquid. \n",
      "I have noticed my nails and hair are growing much stronger and look healthier. \n",
      "\n",
      "The con: the pills smell awful to me. (However my significant other, who I made smell them, doesn't find the smell terrible.)\n",
      "I was tempted to rate this product lower because of the size of the pill.  I've taken many supplements and this is by far the most inconvenient to take.  Hopefully I can take these long enough to get used to taking them and seeing the benefits. \n",
      "I have been taking multi vitamins my whole life, but never felt like they did anything. I decided to try these since I have tried other HIT supplements and thought they were pretty good. They are very large, but not that hard to swallow really. I am almost completely through my first bottle/tub of them and I can definitely say I see and feel a difference. For one, my nails are stronger and longer then they have ever been. Normally they are dull and brittle and break constantly, but now, they are gorgeous. My hair also feels stronger. I feel like i have had more energy to get through my day. I try to take 2 in the morning and 1 with lunch, but if I have time constraints, I just take all 3 with breakfast. I love these vitamins!!\n",
      "I have been taking these vitamins for a month now and these are the first vitamins I've actually been taking routinely.  After a week of taking them I noticed my nails were much stronger and after a month my hair is slightly more thicker but not too much. Hopefully that changes the longer I take them.  I love that these are made especially for women and it has fruits and green in it. I take 2 at breakfast and the third one at dinner. The only negative drawback is that the pills are a bit hard to swallow because of their size. I have to break them in half to swallow them. \n",
      "I have been using this product for a few weeks now, i am currently deployed and its great to know i can receive items out here as if i would back home. I am giving this product an 8 because i dont know if there has been anyone else with the same problem but i started breaking out more than i would like to be. All the other supplements i also take i was fine until i started this product. Other then that, seems to be a good vitamin.\n",
      "I feel that this product works how it should. I feel great after using it a couple weeks now. I noticed my nails growing faster, but it could be from me upping my protein intake. I take two in the a.m. and one at night to make sure I get the optimal multi dose. I will update in a few weeks to keep everyone posted on how it's going with these.\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave it a 1 because It was hard to swallow.  The vitamin was way too big.  I tried cutting it in half and it was just as bad.  I had ordered the product because of the great reviews it had received on here and because I use HIT Fat Burners and HIT Pre Workout for women.  The other products they make have been great.  Unfortunately I was unable to see how this product would work.\n",
      "Two complaints I have with multivitamins 1) they upset my stomach 2) I have to take at various times throughout the day (often times I forget to take them) My tummy is happy and I can even take the daily dosage at one time. Especially made for women, this product supports my level of fitness and I feel great when using it. I immediately noticed a change in how I felt when I ran out ONE time. I don't run out any more.\n",
      "I love this vitamins.\n",
      " i was taking a Vitamin's shake from GNC and my urine was yellow...not a little bit...too much...+ plenty of calories!!!. \n",
      "after iam taking this vitamins this is not happen again and i feel very energized all day.\n",
      "very good\n",
      "I started taking these Multi-vitmains about 2 weeks ago and instantly felt the benefits. They give you such a great boost of energy throughout the entire day. I will make sure to continue to keep taking these. \n",
      "Good quality ingredients and combines both Multi-Vitamin and greens.\n",
      "If you do the math, it comes really cheap to get 2 months worth of both supplements in once jar.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have really high level of energy and no bad reactions so far, after 1.5 month of usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Totally satisfied.\n",
      "Take this daily. \n",
      "in love with these vitamins! only have to take them once a day and the whole foods and green additives really make a difference! plus i LOVE that they have l carnitine glutaine and other aminos to help metaolize fat and keep your energy levels high- great for me since im on cardio 6 days a week plus weights 4 days a week!\n",
      "I like the ingredients in this product to help control my appetite with a boost to overall wellness. I use this along with QuadraLean by RSP and Thermo-Rev by Neon. It would be nice if they would remove the caffeine in this, and add something like Ginger Root, and/or Turmeric to this product.\n",
      "This product worked great for me I took one capsule when I woke up and one before football practice and I went from 260 to 248 in 2 weeks definitely the best thermogenic supplement I have used yet!\n",
      "I have been taking this product for about 3 weeks now. I don't get a hard crash or jitters. The appetite suppressant works, I feel more thirsty than anything. I have lost roughly 6 pounds and a total of 6 inches between my waist and hips/thighs. So a good weight loss and fat loss ratio. I would recommend this product for weight and fat management but not for an energy booster. I still feel pretty sl****ish walking into the gym and takes pushing through sets.  \n",
      "Seems to work ok, I will continue to use it for aid in contest prep\n",
      "Great product to burn fat, it's so sad that BB discontinued it.\n",
      "This is a staple supplement to me. It helps me burn fat without the jitters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love taking this product, I can definitely see a difference it has made in my appearance! It gave me extra energy without any bad side effects. I would recommenced it to anyone! \n",
      "Really didn't make any changes in energy or fat loss.\n",
      "I used an entire bottle of this product and I didn't feel any difference, not in my energy or in my fat lost\n",
      "\n",
      "**** good product, crazy natural energy, natural weight loss\n",
      "Great product, great price! \n",
      "\n",
      "This is by far my favorite fat burning product. Along with the fat burning, it definitely decreases my appetite and gives me far more energy then when I don't take it. This supplement keeps my digestive system regular, which is an added bonus. Have been taking for months and will continue to do so.\n",
      "This product is not working for me.  I am on a strict diet, with no \"empty\" calories such as ice cream and alcohol.  However, over a month in, I haven't lost any weight.  I've been working out really hard, so there's a chance that I'm gaining a pound of muscle for every pound of fat, but what are the odds on that?  Also, right after I ordered the product, it was removed from the Canadian store.  I was hoping that meant it was too strong by local standards.  Unfortunately, I have not had luck with this product.  I will try something different next time. \n",
      "Love this product!  I have been searching for a fat burners to use along with weight training to help me burn more fat.  I read the ratings on this one and decided to give it a try.  I hadn't found anything since Oxy Elite Pro that helped me burn fat effectively.  This doesn't give me jitters or make me sweat and has made a noticeable difference since I bought it 2 months ago.  I definitely recommend giving this product a try.\n",
      "Ive using Torch for a couple weeks now and it has been working really well so far. Does a great job suppressing my appetite without causing me to drip sweating at work or making my heart feel like its going to explode. No jitters or side effects to speak of so far. Cant beat the price. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Great Product. Gives me energy and made me sweat like crazy without the jitters or crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure its even doing anything and does not really curb my hunger at all.  On the plus side no jitter or heart pounding...\n",
      "Very disappointed in this product. I used Gaspari Detonate previously and could most definitely feel the energy and increase in body temperature. With this product, I feel nothing. Not even sure it's doing anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not bad, not amazing.  Does the job.  I started taking 2 in the morning and didn't notice much on my off days, but on my training days it would kick in and do its job.  I have recently started taking one pill with breakfast then one right before a workout, and that seems to work a lot better.  It does give you a bit of a hangover effect for the first week or so, but goes away, especially if you drink enough water.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as fat loss?  I can't really say.  I honestly think I'd have to do a trial with and without it, with no other variables in my diet or workout plan to really say how much it works.  I assume by its thermogenic properties and the fact it makes me sweat (I never sweat) that it's working.\n",
      "For me, this product didn't work much. I previously used an outstanding product and it was the best but unfortunately my body was growing immune to it so I had to make a change of supplement. I looked towards HIT Torch since I didn't seem to find it on GNC's website and it had a good rating for the price but it wasn't worth it. Torch does suppress hunger, somewhat. There's no energy, actually I can fall asleep very easily. Now, I will be looking for another product. \n",
      "I purchased this product on the basis of the reviews. However, now I realize that was a HUGE mistake because this product is nothing but trash! I was taking Cellucor D4 Thermal Shock which worked perfectly but I am always looking for something better. After taking HIT for two weeks my workouts felt sl****ish, increased appetite especially for sweets, and caused sever drowsiness. I wanted to continue with the product hoping it would turn around but it never did. I highly would NOT recommend this to even my worst enemy. I ended up throwing the rest of the bottle in the trash! I have since ordered what on was on previously since the local GNC is completely sold out. \n",
      "This product definitely did not stop my hunger, nor did it provide me any energy. Really disappointed! \n",
      "Just started using this product and absolutely love it.  It is like gold!\n",
      "This is a great product. But don't buy from Bodybuilding.com. They sent me a box of 12 that had less than a week until its \"use by\" date (10/24/16). They sent a replacement box that had the same \"use by\" date and was hence unusable by the time I actually received it today (10/27/16). Disgraceful.\n",
      "I previously used (and loved) Sharkies energy chews, but they seem to no longer be available.  These Honey Stingers taste good.  Unfortunately they're sticky and have a flimsy consistency. \n",
      "\n",
      "They aren't actually chewy - mine are so over-soft that they quickly break apart upon the first chew, so to last longer during my workout I now suck them instead so they endure the way Sharkies did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Honey Stingers are almost as sticky as honey - not in a pleasant way - their outer skin is downright gooey, which you don't want all over your fingers at the gym, so to avoid a mess I have to carefully push-and-squeeze them out of the opened package.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally I'd prefer a chewier matte texture somewhere between Haribo Gold Bears and Swedish fish gummies - which Sharkies managed, but their business model wasn't as effective as Honey Stingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello everyone!\n",
      "Tried this product and I loved!\n",
      "Really good carbs, but only for the reception immediately after the workout.\n",
      "Not sugary, tasty and soft!\n",
      "Recommend and will buy them in the future, because I do not like to drink Creatine because of them gain weight and not lean muscle mass.\n",
      "Good luck to everyone!\n",
      " Its great to get away from the bloated carb feeling of regular gels again and theres no sugarrush it just feels like constant energy. Well done guys\n",
      "Good stuff. Many of my athletes are now using these gels pre- and during workouts. These are my favorite gels regardless of the type of workout.\n",
      "Ordered in September, expired in June...\n",
      "\n",
      "They have sent me nearly 4 months expired food ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not buy!\n",
      "Excellent snack that's not to heavy and great tasting. The honey and lemon flavors are both very good. \n",
      "These are very good snacks and provide a quick big of energy prior to a workout. It tastes almost like a light dessert and is very pleasing on the palate. I would suggest buying the Honey flavored as they are the most pliable and have the best consistency in my opinion. I find that the Gingersnap and Vanilla waffles are more firm and break more like a cookie would. While this is personal preference, I believe the honey snacks are more true to the traditional foods you found made between the two thin waffles.\n",
      "Great product for my pre-workout long cardio sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like these as a quick get-something-into-my-belly snack before a medium-to-long run or bike ride.  Natural honey as your sugar source, great taste, and hey, I admit it's kind of fun to eat a waffle for a snack.  They're so yummy that I always want to eat a second one.  But I don't... \n",
      "I really didn't expect this product to taste good at first. But when I tried that first bite it was so delicious. Gave me a small boost of energy too. The honey flavor was very tasty. I would totally buy more and recommend to a friend.\n",
      "Awesome Product to take as a Pre Workout Carb! Taste is really awesome on the Honey Flavor! Only complaint is they are just a little dry, I'd go 10/10 if there was a way for them to less of a crumbly mess, a few were almost dust before I opened them, still tasted good though!!\n",
      "This product is excellent in every way. I primarily use it for a quick snack before working out, or an on the go snack. The taste is delicious and the serving size is just enough to cut the edge without making me feel full. The only downside is it can get a bit messy as little crumbs break off. Other than that, this is one of the best pre-workout or snack bars I have ever purchased\n",
      "Used these while training and completing a GORUCK Challenge, helped to give me that extra bit of energy needed to get through the 13-hour event.  Definitely recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love these things!  They are a little higher in fat than I prefer but they are great for long workouts.  They are calorie dense and sit well in my stomach.  Also they don't get yucky in hot weather.\n",
      "i really am only compelled to rate things when they exceed my expectations, and these did exactly that. significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for the taste. Some people enjoy it, but personally I feel it tastes like cough syrup or bad sweetener. I do like that it has zero fillers, no stimulants or sugar. Great balance of amions. It mixes well in shaker bottle with water. I find that squeezing lemons into the bottle with it helps cut down on the sweetness. \n",
      "I was looking forward to this product. The breakdown of the particular amino acids was quite promising. BUT as soon as I opened the container, I could tell the taste was going to be terrible. The smell was like visiting the dentists office.  The taste was like drying cough syrup out of a latex glove.\n",
      "I've tried numerous pre workout supplements in the past and this one works every time. Mind blowing pumps and incredible focus during workouts. Most effective pre workout on the market hands down\n",
      "Gives you that extra drive you need. Can feel a noticeable difference in energy levels and strength from taking this supplement. Very helpful for those looking for an edge.\n",
      "I take two pills as an pre-workout  energy booster.  Takes 30 minutes to fully dissolve and be active in the body. I usually do an 20 minute cardio as an starter for my waiting period. Quite energized and focused once all is flowing through my body. Will purchase again, as an energy booster. \n",
      "I love taking this drink. It gives me a boost early in the mornings. I start to take it 30 minutes before a workout and makes me feel good. It doesn't give me any jitters or any caffeine crashes. I do recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great pure agmatine sulfate. Add to your PWO for added pump or take with carbs!\n",
      "Very promising supplement but way overpriced, it does give you a pretty decent pump without any stimulants and you only require 1g. Definitely recommend if you can get a decent price.\n",
      "This product only gave me a NO pump maybe 2 out of 7 times. It was a ok NO pump. I wish it gave me that NO pump every time. The other 5 out of 7 times it made my stomach mildly  wonky. It also made my stool a bit soft. Based on the lack of evidence that any product that says it gives you an NO effect actually does give you a good NO effect to improve your workout and based on my experience with this NO related product. I do not think i will be buying any NO product in my future.\n",
      "Leaves a little bit of an aftertaste, but that's nothing since it makes you feel great! Seems to speed up recovery time like crazy and gives more power in the lift. I myself am not very strong, but this stuff is helping me get there.\n",
      "I guess it is working. I don't notice in changes, positive or negative. Scooper seemed a little big since the Prima Force scooper, which is supposedly 3/4 (750mg) of the I force amount (1000mg), is wayyyyyy smaller. So I actually scooped out the whole tub to see if it was accurate. Supposedly 50 I gram scoops. I got 37 in mine. Not to happy about this iForce! Because I feel like I got ripped off, I am giving this product a lower rating. Bought two tubs of this; hoping the next one actually has 50 servings.\n",
      "Awesome stuff, plain and simple. \n",
      "Epic pumps seems to last forever... Worth every penny. Now a staple of mine. I just love it.\n",
      "This stuff is the real deal! If you guys can afford it also buy some citruline malate add both of them to your pwo and you have a recipe for discusting vasculerty and blood goreging pumps WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO BEGINNERS \n",
      "Great pure Beta Alanine, take 2g a day!\n",
      "Great supp. Does exactly what beta alanine is supposed to do. Get crazy tingles, after weeks of usage, you can clearly feel endurance is a lot better and muscle fatigue is delayed. It's great that it comes with a scoop, unlike some other beta alanine products. Definitely will buy again. \n",
      "This pre/post workout amino acid provides quite a boost.  I can feel it start to kick in if taken about 15 minutes prior to my workout (it makes my whole body tingle) and I get the endurance I need to power through my toughest workouts.  I'm not a big pre-workout supplement guy, but I am absolutely sold on this product.  I get what is needed to tack on a few more reps with every lift throughout my routine and I can really notice the days when I forget to take it.  I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "A tasteless, cost efficient beta alanine supplement.\n",
      "It tastes like sugar and gives the tingles! Also delays muscle fatigues so I can hit more at the gym. Its a must have. \n",
      "I haven't been into weight lifting or bodybuilding very long close to 2 months however this product does work within the first month people said I looked bigger and my bench press has gone up close to 60 lbs since I started using this however since this is the first creatine I have taken it may come off as biased however i will try other creatines when I run out of this so I can see for myself which one's are good or not the only reason I gave it a 9/10 is because it does have a slight chalky taste to it and it doesn't mix very well with a post workout shake but overall I feel this is a good product.\n",
      "This product is really good. If you take 5 pills it'll work but a full 10 pill serving really hits the spot. Take on an empty stomach 1 hour before lifting and you'll get crazy pumps. The powder doesn't work as well in my opinion \n",
      "****!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this products. Pumps and vascularity are insane, doesn't even matter if you're low carbs or flat, the pump is gonna come.\n",
      "I tried all the powder flavors, but none of them taste good to say the truth, and that's why I tried this one. I'm not a fan of taking 10caps at once, but it seems better than the bad tasting powder to me. \n",
      "I love this supplement.I get a great pump and the endurance is off the charts.I push more weight and want to workout longer with this stuff.Great supplement and I would recommend this to anyone looking to push pass a sticking point in their training.\n",
      "Bought this product and Potassium Nitrate when iForce just released these products, and I loved them. Amazing endurance and pumps while on this product. I would highly recommend taking this product as part of a stack if you simply want to increase your endurance. In my opinion this is the best stimulant-free pre-workout product, but if you stack it with a product with energy you will stay in the gym for 2-3 hours no problem. Great experience with iForce products so far. Highly recommended to try for yourself!!! -AlxChungFitness\n",
      "Really liked this product, gave me a great pump and helped me have better workouts. Recommended!\n",
      "Great product feel the speed recovery and the pump on the second week i have tried better products than this one thats why i dont give it a 10.\n",
      "I have taken for 3 day and the muscle pumps are great with each use.  I feel pumped for hours and sometimes the next morning.  I am stacking with Universal Amino Tech which could only help.  I only take 5 which is 1 serving; directions s****est 1-2 servings so I'm gonna try 2 servings today on my Chest day it should be CrayZ\n",
      "This stuff rocks. I really love it, although the powder version was a little better. Pumps are amazing!\n",
      "I have only taken it twice but it does help me reach deeper, less interrupted sleep.  This is critical due to my hectic stressful schedule as a full time student and work.  As for the building muscle and burning fat, hardening, dry aspects it is still too early to tell.\n",
      "Started taking iForce Intimidate a month ago and it has helped me to get the best sleep I have in years. It allows for a deep natural sleep and aid recovery. The drying and leaning part of the ingredient matrix works too. I saw almost immediate results. The one drawback is that sometimes I would awake with a headache. This went away with a little caffeine and activity but some days it was fairly intense. Overall a great product at a reasonable cost. \n",
      "hate to leave bad reviews , but i never felt nothing , from max out, from  the first packet ,,,,,,,, i even took a second packet , of max out a couple hours after for my second workout , an still nothing , an i was on a empty stomach to , that really sucks because i really  was looking forward to seeing how good is was after all the good reviews i red about it ,, really ****** me off , garbage ffs , makes me so ******* angry , but i was thinking , i had the  stuff in the packets , not from the tub itself , wonder do that make a difference \n",
      "Thanks to team IFORCE NUTRITION for giving me the chance for MAXOUT samples, Flavor:BLueberry Pomegranate was very tasty I really enjoyed this flavor plus mixes very well. Now im always honest on my reviews no matter what, the energy/focus was ok, didn't last very long...I didn't get explosive pumps but it was decent so this is why I gave MaxOut a 6 just cause it really do much for me but this is my opinion everyone is different and thanks again IFORCE for this chance!\n",
      "Overall, I really enjoyed this product for it's extreme effectiveness. However; there were some things that I didn't like about it. The mixability for me was very poor, no matter how much water I added or how much I shook it, there were always fragments and clumps floating around. The Blueberry Pomegranate flavor was pretty unpleasant to me, and this was a pre workout that I had to gulp down. But in terms of how it worked - it's awesome. Every single time that I have used this, I've hit a PR. I feel like I have incredible energy for my whole workout. I have to say that the effectiveness > taste/mixability in terms of importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite preworkout by far. Fits perfect with my schedule. Doesn't give me the jitters and I don't have to worry about a caffeine crash mid workout. Keeps me focused all the way through. Not bad tasting either.\n",
      "I've been through 4 tubes of this awesome product by now, and tried both flavors. Vascularity, focus[in the gym as well as outside the gym], and mood[actually i get kind of high in life, uplifted and happy, lol] plus the pumps are off the charts, especially if you push it to 2 scoops(2 servings). Taste is incredible(Lemon Drop), i have no words, it's one of those supps that you can't wait to drink. As far as the other taste(Blueberry Pomegranate), it's pretty meeeeeh, not for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Disclaimer: I am in no WAY affiliated with ANY supplement company!\n",
      "The kick this offers is great. I can push harder,  but the flavors are not to my liking at all the husband thinks the lemon drop is OK.  But there is always lots of in dissolved powder on top no matter how much I stir or what shaker  I use it will not all disolve and I'm not a fan. \n",
      "Very solid PWO. Max Out will remain part of my stack for the foreseeable future. I wake up at 3:30am every morning to lift, and Max Out never lets me down. Very clean energy without the crash, excellent focus, and good pumps. Lemon Drop is delicious!\n",
      "Really didn't see any positives with this product. Doesn't mix well at all. Remained chalky and gritty after a ton of mixing. Very hard to drink, and once you get it down couldn't even tell I took a pre-workout. I even tried doubling up on the serving and still nothing just made the taste worse honestly. I would never recommend this product very unpleased, and already ordered something else because it just wasn't worth trying to keep taking it.\n",
      "So this is as good as people say, it makes you hyped and focused, I do feel a dr****ed out feeling a bit, but it's all apart of it's magic. I personally do experience a crash, however I counter act it with a During Workout Energy Boost like Razor 8 or whatever you prefer. \n",
      "\n",
      "I usually use Pre Jym, which I love, I just like to switch it up to avoid building up an immunity or get bored, so far my and many others #1 is Pre Jym, but this is an amazing different feeling PreWorkout, good to have a few packs in the bag. I do recommend trying it.  Defiantly my #2. \n",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS SUPPLEMENT!!! I am an experienced workout fanatic. Graduated with a bachelors degree in exercise science, put on 50 pounds of muscle in the past 5 years. Just so you know I know what I'm doing. I've taken tons of different pre-workout supps and saw this one on bodybuilding.com with a high rating. It wasn't a bad price, so I figured I'd try it for something new. Even the first day, felt nothing!!! Next day I took 2 scoops to get some benefit from it.....still nothing!!! Worst pre I've used, doesn't even mix well. My Gatorade bottle got clogged with this stuff. I had to buy some C4 to mix with it so I could use it up. DO NOT BUY THIS SUPPLEMENT!!!\n",
      "Good all around pre workout. Great pump. A lot of caffeine but now a days that's what's in. I would recommend this product. \n",
      "I was not impressed with this product.  I decided to try something different and order 10 servings.  It only took 5 workouts before I was on here ordering my old preworkout, I have never felt so drained mid workout.  Muscleprime is a much better option that provides long lasting energy.  I felt like I crashed after half an hour or so with Max Out.  On a positive note, lemon drop did taste really good. \n",
      "Taste good. With 1 portion, i wasn't feeling too pumped up. So you need to try 2 portions to see about the pump.\n",
      "Thought of switching from one of the stim products I used to take to MaxOut, as the effects of the other product were starting to wear off. Anyway, MaxOut is definitely one of the best stim/pump pre on the market. Although this is a high-stim pre, the pumps are monstrous, especially when you stack it with Hemavol.  The good thing about this product is that it's creatine free, but for those who want some creatine in your system, you can add a some to your shake. I've been using this product, and you can check out my physique progress on instagram. jpn.volume.training is my account. Highly recommended(not a big fan of the taste thought)\n",
      "I do not know what everyone sees in this stuff whey to much caffeine witch I did not feel. decent pump but other than that it is useless \n",
      "I have tried many of the NO generators out there, citrulline and arginine analogues, and none of them work as well as this one.  Even one pill before a workout gives long-lasting pumps that last all day.  Stacked with Agmatine Sulfate, it works even better.  If you don't believe this product might work, just look at all of the pre-workouts that list beetroot extracts high in nitrates.  This product is the nitrates portion.  I would highly recommend trying this product.\n",
      "My favorite pill NO2 product. Works great, and very nicely priced. \n",
      "Works great, Potassium Nitrate (KNO3) is great for taking PWO for added pump!\n",
      "Solid Product! The beast if stack with hemavol (1.5 scoop of hemavol and 2 capsule of potassium nitrate)\n",
      "\n",
      "Best pump I ever got!\n",
      "The pills are small are very easy to swallow. Started of with 2, but it wasn't till I got to 4, that it really kicked in. Most workouts it took about 2-3 sets are I was all pumped up. One of the best pumps of my life. The great thing about it was that it didn't go away the moment you walked out of the gym. I managed to stay pumped for another hour or 2. \n",
      "\n",
      "Value is tremendous. It is really cheap, even whn taking full dose of 4 pills every workout. I haven't taken it on off days. See no reason for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I were to rate it out of 10, I would give it a solid 10. Maybe it is a little weaker than MT Nanostim, however it is almost twice a much cheaper. For 19 USD you get 30 workouts at full dose of 4 pills. \n",
      "\n",
      "Will defiently buy again and recommend it to anyone who is a pump junkie :P\n",
      "another waste of money.. what tolerance. nothing to tolerate from other than lose of money... felt nothing from the first time I took it. \n",
      "don't waste your money\n",
      "Intense pump great for mind to muscle connection\n",
      "Absolutely SKIN SPLITTING pumps!\n",
      "I have used a number of NO2 producing products over the years that worked.  This product was not one of them.  I used 2 caplets with water.  No change in strength.  I cut the tips of the 2 caplets and mixed in water.  No change.  I tried the same procedure with 4 caplets.  Nothing.  I was encouraged to find this product produced the NO2 effect without the use of caffeine.  But after actual use I am more than a little discouraged with this product.\n",
      "Did not notice any benefit whatsoever.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Massive pumps long after workouts. I love this stuff.\n",
      "I take two pills about 15 mins prior to workout and this stuff kicks in hard. If I'm on an empty stomach it doesn't take long. I feel really focused and determined to workout. I leave the gym feeling satisfied and with a great pump. Really feel the blood flow increase. Love the Vitamin C bonus!\n",
      "\n",
      "Bodybuilding.com had a deal of buy 2 get 1 free when I purchased these. I found two dudes I worked with and we all went in. Came out to $15 a piece! For 120 Capsules/60 Servings that is awesome!\n",
      "Just recently started using this product. Have not used many nitrates in the past, but wow is this stuff killer. Awesome pumps from 2-4 caps, great to stack with a stim or non stim pre, and the added Vitamin C is a great touch from iForce. Quality product from an even more quality company. Great job guys. Very inexpensive so give it a try folks!\n",
      "Mixed well with any types of pre-workout, nice pump. I will keep using it.\n",
      "Works good, no flavor and mixes well in my PWO drink.\n",
      "I've bought this product twice. The way I took it was 1scoop upon waking or Pre Workout and 1 scoop before heavy carb meals. My 1st container was awesome. All day pumps and veins, looked of great quality. The 2nd one was different. First, the seal had something Chinese in it, the 1st one didn't. Then upon taking it with the same protocol as the 1st one, I didn't feel anything. My guess is they changed manufacturers and the quality just isn't the same. Would not recommend it now.\n",
      "No taste, mixes great. I love to add it to my PWO for an added pump, and it is fantastic. That euphoric workout feeling, that's what agmatine helps with! \n",
      "\n",
      "This product is amazing! Great pumps and mixes well with all supplementation!\n",
      "This product is great. The pumps are awesome.  Taste isn't that great when taken alone with water but over all it is now a mainstay in my supplementation \n",
      "Extremely good!! It was recommended to me and I will be recommending it to everyone. Definitely worth a try\n",
      "I understand the reasoning behind agmatine but it didn't do squat for me. I mix one scoop (750mg) with my pre-work out drink about 30 minutes before hitting the gym. No noticeable pump difference. I will finish the tub and never order it again. Be prepared when you open the tub because the scoop it tiny (imagine the size of a split pea, yeah that small) and there isn't a whole lot in there. It is a sulfate so it stinks really bad as well. \n",
      "I have to say I love this product.  I have been using it for the past month now and I have noticed the pump and hardness in muscles last a lot longer.  Its easily mixable in any pre workout drink as well.  I was a little skeptical at first when I saw how small the packing and scoop was but man it totally blew me away.  Only Infinite Labs could make such great products as these and be able to hook you up with the most bang for your buck.  Love this company.  I have to say I would not have made the gains I have without Infinite Labs Products.  I highly recommend them...\n",
      "It mixes well; however, it is unbearable when mixed with just water. I mix it with my pre-workout and my post workout shake.  It does and supports what the product is for.\n",
      "good product. bought because of the ratio of bcaa's and lack of other \"filler\" products. combine with gfuel for a caffeine boost before and afternoon lift for my 16 year old son. taste is fine when combined w gfuel. cost is good. no problems mixing. he likes the product better than bcaa capsules which were like horse pills. hard to say results from this product as he supplements w bcaa, creatine w fenugreek and whey. zero doubt that this combination with good nutrition and sound strength program makes a difference.\n",
      "Tastes terrible.  Mixes well.  Add additionally to Pre and Post Jym, and Protein shakes to max out BCAA effects.  Not sure what I am supposed to see in terms of results.\n",
      "very good, without sugar, perfect.\n",
      "Doesn't taste that great with just water but if you put it in your juice then it's not too bad.  I think it helps me with my workout.\n",
      "Good for it's intended purpose I suppose, but is unbearable in straight water. Really terrible taste unless you mix it with juice/Gatorade/Mio \n",
      "This is an excellent and necessary product for those serious about their body. Though it is hard to mix by spoon, if you have a shaker it mixes in great! You can't taste it at all!\n",
      "Read some reviews about its mixability. Mine turned out great! Dissolved easily and completely and didn't stick to the cup, completely tasteless too. So much better than what I was taking before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in preserving their hard earned muscle... I use this product DAILY, offseason and precontest especially. Infinite Labs BCAAS are easily mixed into any beverage you choose to consume while training... This is a flat out MUST HAVE if you're at all serious about building and maintaining your muscle.\n",
      "Never got to see if this product works as I tried it - mixed it in with my protein - could not drink it was foul and completely unbareable!\n",
      "Great Stuff! I mix with Juggernaut pre workout and take with my post workout shake as well. Mixes well and I really noticed the muscular stamina I had.\n",
      "The most potent BCAA caps ive ever used, theyre fantastic! for anyone whos looking for a BCAA to use pre, intra or even post workout, i suggest the infinite BCAAs!\n",
      "I use this intra workout and it has made a huge impact on the quailty of my workout. I instantly feel the bcaa going to work. I never feel pain, in turn makes me push harder. Between this and the rest of my inifinte labs stack, recovery and growth has been a constant, and a very success one at that.\n",
      "The BCAA is amazing all I would ask for is a flavored one so that the taste isnt bland plus its hard to get a good mix with it in other drinks ftaste wise.\n",
      " The only type that I had ever tried was in pill form. This time I ordered the powdered form. My problem with the powder is I have a problem with its mixibility. this is the reason i gave it a 7/10. The BCAA's still do the job that I use them for and with that I am very happy with. The next time I will order them in the pill form.\n",
      "Love The amino Boost This product provides Helps with recover and mixed with CarnoCre is unstoppable!\n",
      "Been takin IL BCAA for about 2 weeks now and I think that it has helped a lot with soreness and saving my muscles while im slimming down..\n",
      "Def a must in my supplement bag from now on. Hands down the best BCAA's I've taken. Mix well in a shaker and has very little to no taste. Tastes great in a 20oz bottle with Crystal light or in a protein shake. Very fine powder\n",
      "To remain in a state of muscular regeneration and prevent getting sore, I drink BCAAs. With Infinite Labs BCAAs,I'm able to weight train consecutive days and for longer periods without getting the &quot;burning&quot; sensation during my workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very mixable even in plain water it has no grit or clumps\n",
      "BCAAs have helped me time and time again reduce the muscle soreness that I've had. Makes those long leg workouts not so painful the next days!\n",
      "I have been using the IL BCAA's for about 3 weeks now. I usually mix them with Crystal Light or Powerade as a intraworkout. A lot of other unflavored BCAA's I have used gave me a bad chemical aftertaste. I don't get this with this product. I notice an increase in energy during my workout and quicker recover time. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Very Good product Love It!! It Gives Me What I Need! For my bodybuilding!!\n",
      "Carnitine MTX is a good product for people who is trying to sweat off some fat.   I use it before I do my walk everyday and I can see the fat coming off quickly without losing any muscle.. I would recommend it for any woman who is trying to stay lean. \n",
      "No noticeable difference.  Look at the bright side, I got the most expensive urine in the neighborhood.\n",
      "Good quality carnitine. I've bought carnitine from several different brands and this is by far the best. Sweat a lot. \n",
      "I tried l-canitine twice. First one was altar from prima force which worked. second one was this which did not!\n",
      "My goal is to gain weight rather than lose it, but I want real muscle, not fat weight. I think Carnitine MTX has helped me keep the fat off, and I've gained 8 pounds -- 8 more to go!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did not see much, if any, benefit. Probably won't use again.\n",
      "Definite difference in definition\n",
      "I have tried other fat-burners, but to no avail; however, this one is good quality and will help a lot if one does a fair amount of Cardio. I lost a few pounds, but I know I would have lost more if i did more cardio, which I was not focusing on. Nevertheless, a good quality supplement worth trying.\n",
      "I have been taking this for about two weeks and what a difference it has made. I was on a fat burner for over a month before taking this and I saw very slow losses in weight and waist. However, in the short time Ive started Crnitine MTX, I have already lost 3 lbs and a half inch on my waist. I used to nap daily (my job gets me up very early) but I dont need to on this product, I have energy that lasts all day and no shaking hands either. I feel like I start sweating sooner in my workout and that makes me feel even more ready to work! If I was told I could only take two or three supplements at a time, I would choose Infinite Labs Carnitine MTX first. Im not giving it a perfect score because nothing is perfect, but believe me when I say I have zero regrets taking this product.\n",
      "Decided to give this a try since I had a 2 for 1 deal here at BB.com. I have been on it for almost a month and I can say I haven't noticed anything different with this product. I haven't gone leaner and don't feel anymore energy with this product. Maybe it works for some of you but out of all the products I tried this product just doesn't do anything for me.\n",
      "I've never rated a product before, feeling that I couldn't tell if a product was the source of changes in my physique, but the only change in my supplement mix in the past two months was the addition of Infinite Labs Carnitine MTX.  My body fat has been stuck at 10%-12% for years, but in the past 2 months, I've dropped to 8%, and am looking way more cut than ever in my life.  This stuff works!\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely one of best Carnitine supplements on the market - I noticed a significant increase in energy and stamina.  What surprised me the most about MTX was the improved sense of wellbeing I experienced on it.  Carnitine is known to assist the body in maintaining proper levels of Seratonin which is probably why.  Give this a shot and see what it does for you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Been taking this on and off again for four years. When you start, take only one dose. This stuff gives me all sorts of odd feelings for the first day. After that, I am usually good. Drink lots of water, if not already. Do not take on an empty stomach, and ensure you take at least 30 minutes before your workout. When ready, take two a day, but be ready to accept the consequences. My wife really dislikes the \"constant desire and energy\" I have.\n",
      "Very good product. I've been taking Cyclo Bolan NT for 6 weeks with Infinite Labs BCAA and have noticed solid gains. I will continue to use Infinite Labs products.\n",
      "I found this to be an interesting product. When doing high rep range lifts (example being cable flies), I found myself getting chills all over my body, lasting through the last 3 or 4 reps. These chills were accompanied with increased sensations of aggression. This effect wore off after a few weeks of use. While I won't be using this product again, that was an interesting sensation to say the least. \n",
      "This stuff hits hard and quick! Aggression is way up,not good if you're already an angry person lol!\n",

      "Been taking Cyclo Bolan NT for 2 weeks now. I am 22 and trying to get rid of some gyno I had since I was a little kid. I was a little edgy the first week, but am getting used to it and is not a problem anymore. Simply put I am loving it. I have energy throughout the day; I am in college and can not wait to get out of class to hit the gym. Am able to pump out more sets without fatigue. DO NOT take pre-workout with this. Took a scoop of jack3d one day and had to cut my workout short because I was too amped up and breathing shallow. Sex drive is definitely increased. Noticeable fat loss in my midsection already and my arms and veins are looking huge when I lift\n",
      "This product has helped me reach new personal strength records. My strength has gone up while I am on it, and my intensity is extreme when I am in the gym. I can tell the difference when I am on it, and when I cycle off of it, like now. Looking forward to starting another cycle tomorrow!!!\n",
      "This product brought my natural testosterone levels back to normal almost immediately. It was a very noticeable difference. At one moment my libido was completely none existent, 3 days after taking product my libido started coming back, a little more every day. I used my libido as a measurement of testosterone levels. This product has definitely raised my testosterone. Im two weeks in now so long term effects are yet to be seen.\n",
      "i have used this for 2 weeks now and have noticed incredible strength gains. impressed with that. i have only gained 3lbs for the two weeks. i take two pills  3x a day. increment of 8 hrs. i was taking the 2nd dose 1-2hrs before workout and during the workout i would feel naseau and throw up everytime??? so i just started to take it after my workouts and i have been fine ever since. i will write on this again when i am done with both bottles. so far i am fairly impressed with two week use of this. \n",
      "It has been a week since I've started taking Cyclo Bolan NT. Within the 7 days x three pills a day, I find myself more aggressive with the way I workout. Primarily due to the most I've seen of 45% Tribulus Terresteris in Cyclo Bolan NT. As I have only taking it for the past week, I've considerably have lifted heavier weights, ran longer distances (which is my weakness) and feel solid in a way. I believe the key ingredient with Cyclo Bolan NT is Bioperine! Clinical research shows that this particular ingredient, composition and supplement increases the absorption of nutrients in the body.. It contains 95 percent piperine, which has potential health benefits.Check my blog for full review. I recommend this product to ALL hardgainers and others\n",
      "THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT BUT BE CARE BECAUSE ITS VERY STRONG,NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED\n",
      "This product really helped me gain some mass, I noticed it and do did other people it also makes you ***** as **** lol\n",
      "Great Natural test booster.  Completed my first bottle and now on too my Second to finish my cycle.  I have notice some decent gains and being able to maintain my gains as I go through my \"cutting phase\"  I have been impress so far and believe this would be even more impressive if I was in a bulking phase.  Another benefit? CYCLO BOLAN has also definitely put some more pep in to my pepper if you know what I mean.\n",
      "This product is pretty intense and definitely takes your body a day or two to get acclimated with the ingredients. However once you get to weeks 4 and 5 you really start to feel it kickin in and notice some solid gains in the mirror. I’m approaching week 6 and plan on running it for a 12 week duration. Overall I’m lovin the results and am very pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "Ive been taking this product for one month and have noticed my muscles hardened and more aggressive in the gym.. good product.\n",
      "Very horrible product. I took it for a little more than a month with no change whatsoever. So then I decided to double the dosage and still nothing. No side effects and no real effects. Not worth the money at all.\n",
      "Great muscle gains, and along with the benefits it claims to bring. I disliked very much the amount of hair loss experienced with this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love it! it took about 10 days to start feeling results, but definitely works for me.\n",
      "Took till the second month to notice the advantages of this product. It is now part of my everyday supplements. Showed my Endochronologist and he was impressed by the ingredients. Thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good product! Could definitely tell the difference in strength gains & energy! So far, so good! \n",
      "I took the Cyclo Dex with the Cyclo Bolan, It is a great product as I can feel and see the results as compared to without it\n",
      "At 10 days to finish it, I haven't see any significant changes.\n",
      "I'm 180 lbs. 6' 2  and this product gave me great results. I rarely write reviews but this product is really good. Def a must buy\n",
      "Waste of Money... A lot of things may theoretically make sense, but in practice, no noticeable effect.\n",
      "We i take supplement I like to stick with one brand so I know what work. If you use different company sometime you can tell. So I tried a nice stack of Infinite labs products. I was using J****ernaut , cyclo test, final cutz, joint support,creatine and I disappointed major. I done with infinite labs. I can understand if one of your product are bad but all suck. I got some cyclo tren left and I hope it's not bad ... There stuff must be way under dosed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not bad product. Never realized how much it was helping until i came off it. Ive tried other cheaper products and felt nothing from them. This one gave me some nice gains and strength. Does cost a bit so make sure you buy it when its on sale. To me it was worth it compared to other cheaper products\n",
      "\n",
      "I realized how good it was when I stopped taking it'\n",
      "it increased my strength and muscle mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good stuff,1 week in and strength is going up as well as endurance.\n",
      "I was excited about thos product, and my complaint is not with efficacy as my strength did increase substantially in deadlifts. But my God, the gas, rancid painful bloating gurgling gas for hours after I took it. This was the only thing I took differently than my normal regimen. Stopped it, and it was gone. \n",
      "Product works and it's cheap, it doesn't mix very good.\n",
      "I recommend it!\n",
      "I can say that this product .. Does work.....and great for the price and the amount you get . Only\n",
      "Down fall is product doesn't mix well in a blender bottle.... Overall good product will buy again \n",
      "Decided to give this product a go. Wish it worked out for me but it did not. This product left me exceptionally bloated in the mid section. went off it and reverted to my normal self after two weeks. \n",
      "Im the type of person that reads the labels and when i saw this product i knew this was the bcaa product i wanted to use. I use this as an intra workout supplement and wow! Its night and day with and without it. My muscles can last longer and are less fatigued after high weight workouts. \n",
      "My main problem is getting it to mix. It never really mixes, but the taste is good.\n",
      "This is fantastic fruit punch!  I love my ride home from the gym with my BCAA peak.  It gives me renewed energy. By the time I arrive home I'm ready for my protein shake.  On taste alone this is worth trying :)\n",
      "\n",
      " To me it taste a little funny but kind but I feel my weight limits are going up more \n",
      "Excellent product, just the fact of having over 6g of leucine says everything. Both flavors I tries I just loved. The others I haven't tried so far, bur will pretty soon.\n",
      "Since I have used this product, I  have felt a faster recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great BCAA and at a good price!  So far I  prefer the watermelon flavor.  I take one scoop in 16-20 oz of water during my workout.  It has a high amount of leucine and helps with endurance, recovery and muscle fatigue.  I have tried other popular brands, but found Inner Armour works best for me. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great recovery product!\n",
      "Really helps my muscles settle after a hard workout. Blue Raspberry is the best flavor.\n",
      "WIth a high Leucine ratio and a low price, you won't find a better BCAA product on the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing product!  I have tried several BCAA's and nothing compares to Inner Armour BCAA Peak. My workout doesn't feel complete without it. A must have for anyone serious about their training. \n",
      "\n",
      "Blue ras has great taste. I take a half serving before my lifts and a full serving after. I feel great after taking it, less tired, and ready to continue my day. Would reccomend and will buy again\n",
      " I found that because of the great flavor I was drinking double my usual Intra workout liquids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a big inner armour fan, but this product had a bad chemical after taste. It is a must to mix with something else. It mixed pretty good for a BCAA powder, but would have some real foamy residue that seemed like a waste of the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad solubility in water.\n",
      " I give this a poor rating because if, you can't mix all the product into water, then you can't really absorb all the product, and this will affect how the product performs.\n",
      "I LOVE this stuff!!!! Powder is so fine and pure like flour, mixes perfectly, tastes amazing, get your money's worth, can mix one scoop with 20oz of water in my blender bottle for my 2 hour workout. Going to try watermelon next. **** Xtend LOL\n",
      "I tried BCAA Peak and got good results from it. I was really sore after high intense works. I really come workout harder and longer. I have used other BCAA's before but with Inner Amour BCAA Peak, I got more and better results. I made it part of my basic supplement list. The taste is ok, but be sure to always shake it up because of the foam. Other than that I like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seems to work well but does not mix as well as it should as there is alot of residue. A great bang for your buck and hopefully newer versions will mix better, I recommend this company's products.\n",
      "This is a pretty good BCAA product. I enjoyed the watermelon flavor but, when you mix the product it creates a thick foam at the top of the drink. You can either eat the foam with a spoon or add some more water and try to swirl it around to get it to break down. The foam tastes awful. I haven't really noticed much of a difference stacking the BCAA's with my weight gainer but, the BCAA only lasts twenty days. If I took it longer then I may notice a difference. This product is good if you're looking for a BCAA that is loaded with leucine but, I just can't get past the foam taste.\n",
      "Couldn't drink it at all, dissolves properly, but taste is not good in my opinion. Profile is good. \n",
      "Taste is pretty good, you can mix it with 20 fl. oz water and still tastes well. I didn't experience any effect like energy or fat loss on this though, but it's a nice drink replacement.\n",
      "I used the raspberry...not sure why they do not offer it anymore.  : (\n",
      "\n",
      "WIl order the watermelon next.\n",
      "\n",
      "This mixes well and tastes decent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I add it to my vanilla protein shakes with some fruit.\n",
      "nice\n",
      "The flavor of this pre-workout isn't very good. At all. One scoop definitely isn't enough for any effect to be felt. Two scoops is better but still not very good. Won't buy again\n",
      "Absolutely terrible. Paid for 1 bottle and the container shook and sound like little pebbles and rocks were inside. Needless to say it looked like a lot of moisture entered into it and dried up and now I have pop-rock candy. Got another sent from Bodybuilding.com and the same thing again. Do no buy.\n",
      "Didn't give me any energy or pump that I am use to from other products. Won't try again\n",
      "This product is good but did not give me any strength at all. Can't be taken together weight a loss supplements. This product did help gain muscle.\n",
      "Decent overall preworkout product. Kind of a jack of all trades. Pretty good pumps, some added energy and good amounts of creatine and beta alanine. Didn't stand out from the crowd but was definitely a good product, especially when considering its value. I eventually worked up to 2 scoops by the end but was at 1.5 for awhile. Never felt any jitters, which is good, but didn't have the same energy as some higher stim preworkouts and good pumps, particularly on arm day. Mixed pretty well, with only a stray particle or two when shaken up in a water bottle. Blue raspberry was a flavor and I didn't get tired of it. Watermelon wasn't the best or the worst, I felt it had a little bit of an artificial flavor to it, but then again watermelon flavored things aren't my favorite. Overall a good jack of all trades preworkout with great value.\n",
      "Worked good and mixes well. \n",
      "good pre -workout... so i give 7 if you use just this product if you mix with bcaa like i do i give 10 works very good\n",
      "Initial rush is great, however if you're going to workout heavy I would go with something different. Twenty minutes into my workout I had to take another half serving... Not impressed compared to other pre-workouts. Blue Raspberry flavor taste great though, I could drink it all day.\n",
      "This a great pre workout! But the reason why I gave it a four was because when I got it the mail I opened it and the whole thing was like hard.\n",
      "great \n",
      "\n",
      "Great supplement at a reasonable price. Works very well compared to other preworkouts I've taken and I love that it is not a CNS stimulant. Would recommend taking 1.5-2 servings to get optimal performance although I could feel the effects with one scoop. Have had amazing workouts with this supplement. I will be purchasing it again.\n",
      "This is easily in my top 3 favorite pre workouts! Really good formula with no proprietary blends which is a HUGE plus in my book. While the dosing is spot on, it really is a 2 scooper for the full effects and seems to work well for me. Tastes are pretty good. Fruit punch is pretty spot on as is the blue raspberry. Neither have any artificial colors added so they come out looking like a clearish white color. The caffeine gives a good buzz without feeling over stimmed and the pumps with this product are amazing! Definitely worth looking at if you're looking for a new pre workout. \n",
      "fantastic product, I wanted to try something different from the common brands and found this one, lets just say I don't want to go back all my lifts have gone up in weight in just 2 weeks of using this product, great stuff\n",
      "I love the taste of the Blue Rasberry. It mixes perfect. The energy I get is just what i need in this pre-workout. I started and just took the 1 scoop recommended and it gave me a good rush of energy. Now i have been taking anywhere from 1.5 to 2 scoops and it is perfect. The exact rush that you want before heading to the gym. It gives a good \"clean\" energy. I Highly recommend this to everywhere.\n",
      "Had the fruit punch flavor tastes great but does little to nothing for me energy-wise. I wouldn't recommend. \n",
      "Muscle Rush Peak by Inner Armour is by far the best creatine Ive ever tried in my life and ive tried a good variety of different products and Inner Armour has out done then selves and exceeded my expectations!! Every time i take my 2 scoops my energy levels flip and so does my mood! My workouts have never been more intense! Ive been using this product for a few weeks now and there hasn't been  a day yet that I haven't felt that intense rush!\n",
      "One of the better pre-workouts I have tried. Mixes very easily and smooth. Taste is ok if not a bit tart.  Gives a bit of the beta alanine tingles.  Gets me focused and pumped.  I still take a N.O. supplement with it and haven't noticed and increased \"pumps\".  Just for comparison sake, I would give NoxiPro a 10/10 as it is my absolute favorite.  \n",
      "overall good pre-workout. have tried many in my past. comes in nice container, and usually take right at 2 scoops. Mixes super well and tastes like hawaiian punch. offered a fairly sizable pump throughout every exercises, especially arms, and believe it or not in legs/calves. Beta alanine in it gives a mild/medium itch or tingle to pores specifically on the face. would recommend to a moderate gym goer not looking to break the bank but get a great pump and focus/stamia during workouts\n",
      "try many  brand but this one is the best so far !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is hands down the best preworkout supplement that I have ever used. This gave me great power and could really feel more of a controlled, smooth, no jitters, no going crazy out of your head boost. Took a bit over 30 mins to kick in but once it did, I was right in the middle of a set and thought I was going to need a break and it got me through the rest of the it. I've tried 1mr, C4, Craze, Neurocore, No-xplode, and a few others and this is by far my favorite. Worth it to try!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great, no fish taste. Wish bottles had larger qty!\n",
      "Has no taste, \n",
      "A great way to boost your weight loss and energy! Just be sure to drink a gallon of water everyday because it will cause you to become dehydrated without the proper fluid intake. \n",
      "Let's start with the flavor: It's bad. Not just bad, it tastes like straight up chemicals with a faint resemblance of watermelon. After 2 weeks using it, I can't wait for it to end so I don't have to taste it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to the effects: I've taken too much coffee in the last few years, but i took a 6-month break (1 small cup a week, at max) before taking this. In the first scoop, it gave me a mild energy boost, and a medium anxious feeling (normal for me when I take accelerators). The second scoop gave me a lighter feeling like the above.\n",
      "In the second day, it felt just like a cup of coffee, and it's being like this since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not much of a help with the weight loss too... I think the components are somewhat sub-dosed.\n",
      "I've replaced my morning coffee with this, and it gives me more energy (250mg caffeine). I put it in 24oz of water(contigo water bottle). Keeps my body burning ... Happy with it, and watered down the taste isn't so bad. Tastes like crystal light.\n",
      "i would recommend a capsule instead of having to drink this, but it isn't bad. great results\n",
      "This fat burner has all the ingredients you could ask for. Definitely one of the best mixes on the market. The only knock is the taste. Kind of bitter and tastes like straight chemicals. Get through the taste, you got a great fat burner.\n",
      "Great product!!\n",
      "This is the first and only tribulus/test boost product i have ever taken. I have to say that it does a little something which is worth the low price per serving. My next purchase will be a different brand because i must try something else to see if my body reacts differently to it and to compare with another test booster.\n",
      "Definitely the quickest and most effective way to up your grip strength. Great quality porducts that will last a lifetime so the price is worth it. I would recommend starting with the trainer and working your way up from there unless your grip strength is already exceptional \n",
      "Very good grippers! I am really impressed with the quality of these grippers. The grips have course grooves to help aid your squeeze. I have been using these for a few weeks and can really see an improvement. Yes, I would recommend these grips to anyone! I am looking forward to climbing the grip strength ladder!\n",
      "Get off your *** and then sit back down to buy this product. You NEED this! I couldn't close a gripper from Walmart when I started and after a couple months I am ready to go beyond the trainer. I do them at work  and \"grease the groove\" whenever I can. They even offer certifications when you get real strong. \n",
      "They're everything they say they are: durable, high-quality and tough to close.  I have the Trainer and #1.  My hands are meatier and my forearms are bigger as a result of using them.  I have noticed that the knurled aluminum handles are rough on the hands.  Lending them to a noob almost always elicits an \"ow, these are rough!\".\n",
      "Good and quality product!!\n",
      "\n",
      "lovin this product...felt a difference in energy levels right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this for my mom because of joint pains she was having; some of it due to age, but after her wreck that took place 2 years ago, she was having severe pain in her knee (popping), hands, and wrists. After taking this supplement (along with her vitamin), all of her pains have gone away after the third week or so. This stuff really works\n",
      "My 3 year old loves these. They are individually wrapped, and she calls them her green presents. Easy way to make sure she gets some extra omega-3 and vitamin c. \n",
      "For children a great product of omega-3!\n",
      "WONDERFUL PRODUCT. Premium Ingredients that actually works. I take 30-45mins before bed and i am knocked out then wake up fully refresh and in charge. if you are a very active person you would want this product in your stack, it just recharges you for another day in the office(GYM). also my morning wood is stronger than ever lol. only down fault i have with this product is it seems that it makes me wanna pee earlier than i usually wake up though i still wake up refresh but it does suck i have to wake up earlier to go pee. Other than that i would buy again just cause of all the awesome ingredients you get in one pill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered this because I heard good things from some friends and I love it! Great taste - mixes very well. The only drawback is that there is essentially no bio gro in it...literally 1/3 of a normal serving, so it isn't really gonna do much for a 200+ lb guy. Other than that, I'm very happy with this new product and I'm most likely going to keep it in my stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure if I received a bad batch of this powder , but it was not a pleasant experience. Very strong odor and after taste lasted for hours. I used one scoop and will be returning\n",
      "Good Lord this has the most awful after taste! I used it 3 times total. I've used way better BCAA's before. Never again will I get this. \n",
      "I have been using Amino Amp for the past 3 weeks, and it is fantastic!  I am loving the taste (primarily the watermelon, but now the grape too).  I started using this product  to help combat my loss of lbm during cutting.  I can say with all honesty, I'm still dropping weight.. and still experiencing some strength gains.  That is something, I am very happy about.  I've been drinking the aminos during fasted AM cardio workouts, and all day long mixed in my water bottle at work.  I've also mixed it in my preworkout smoothies.\n",
